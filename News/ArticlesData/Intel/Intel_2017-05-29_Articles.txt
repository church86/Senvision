These NSFW Deadpool Bloopers While We Wait For The Sequel Intel's New Core i9 Is An 18-Core Behemoth With A Price Tag To Match Campbell Simpson May 31, 2017, 9:30am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories computex 2017 feature video feature Share Image: Intel When AMD came out guns blazing with its multi-core, heavily multi-threaded Ryzen CPUs, we knew that Intel wouldn't take long to respond. And it has, with a new line-up of Core i5, i7 and a new i9 with as many as 18 cores and 36 hyperthreading threads. They'll be phenomenally fast, of course, but will have a price tag that puts any other PC component you could think of to shame. Introduced at Computex in Taipei, Intel's latest CPUs use a new X299 chipset and new 2066-pin socket. CPUs with from four to 18 physical cores are on offer, so there's a huge range of options at — a huge range of prices. The cheapest quad-core Core i5-7640X (with no hyperthreading) is a $US242 part, for example, while the top of the line 10-core (and 20 thread) i9-7900X is an eye-bleeding $US999. Image: Intel Those 4, 6, 8, and 10-core chips will launch first around the world, and 12, 14, 16, and 18-core CPUs will follow soon enough. All the chips have comparatively very high TDP thermal thresholds, so you'll need to invest in a gutsy water or air cooler to let these Core X processors run free without throttling back under load. Where Intel's mainstream desktop CPUs top out at around 90 Watts, these ones will hit 140 — and Intel's recommending water cooling as standard for the first time. Intel says it's by far the most extreme desktop processor it's ever produced, and it's taken a page from the book of its server-grade Xeon chips to put the new hardware together. Compared to its previous generation of "most powerful ever" Extreme chips, the company is quoting a 10 and 15 per cent jump in multi- and single-threaded performance respectively. Ryzen must have Intel spooked, because AMD's massively multi-core chips represented the first time that 8-core CPUs hit the mainstream desktop PC market. AMD's Ryzen is a superlative multi-core performer and brings that "mega-tasking" multi-tasking — gaming, streaming, saving content — to the mainstream in a way that the company hasn't seen success with in years. It has a new server and high-end desktop CPU, too, called Threadripper — up to 16 cores and 32 threads — and likely at a competitive price. Intel also took the opportunity to hint at its 8th-gen Core processors, still a few weeks away from an official unveiling — expect up to 30 per cent better performance, it says, bringing quad-core and eight-thread performance to its mainstream Core i7-7500U equivalent mobile chips which are currently only dual-core. Laptops could be getting a significant speed boost in the near future. Gizmodo traveled to Computex as a guest of Dell. Comments Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja May 31, 2017, 11:44am and we wait..... Reply 0 ANumberOne Guest Jun 3, 2017, 11:50pm AMD throws down, and Intel hits back even harder! Reply 0 Danny Gonzalez Guest Jun 5, 2017, 7:56am Preliminary results from UserBenchmark are only showing a 4% total increase in speed over the Ryzen 7 1800X. I don't think it's a very hard hit, especially at that hypothetical price tag. If they bump it down to maybe $650 for the chip, then it'll definitely be a stiff blow. Most people are willing to cough up the extra $150 for what would be the equivalent of maybe an i3 taped to an i7 (so to speak). But unless the price changes in a downward motion, it's not a serious threat to the Ryzen. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

The news has upset many enthusiasts as they feel Intel should spend the extra money to solder the lids onto to have far superior CPU temperatures. We directly asked our contacts at Intel if they would be using Thermal Interface Material (TIM) on Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X and got the following statement back in an e-mail. Intel is using the same thermal interface material as was used on the prior Intel Core X-series processor (Broadwell-E). We don’t share further detail on TIM as it pertains to Intel products as performance characteristics of our thermal interface material is considered Intel intellectual property. The news that Intel isn’t soldering down the lid is good news for der8auer though as he just happens to sell enthusiast friendly delidding tools that take off the Integrated Heat Spreader on Intel processors quickly with minimal risk to the processor. His DELID DIE MATE 2 (DDM2) is just one example of the many Intel CPU delid tools that have come out in recent years. You also have the Rockit 88 or if you wanted to 3D print your own tool you can download free plans for an Intel Kaby Lake delid tool! There are also relid attachment kits that you can purchase! Delidding a processor can drop temperatures on a quad-core Haswell processor by roughly 10-20C, so it has to make a dramatic difference. Enthusiasts are speculating that delidding an Intel Core i9-7980XE with 18-cores right will have even better results since it has four times as many cores.  We’ve seen people at Computex 2017 say that you can expect temperatures of over 85C on the 165W TDP Skylake-X parts and thus the reason for required water cooling. It looks like Intel Core i9 X-series processors are going to be interesting to overclock due to the low thermal headroom thanks to having so many cores! Here is the latest video der8auer has up about the Delid Die Mate X (DDM-X) that he is making for Skylake X where it seems a 20-30C temperature drop might be possible by delidding the processor. Six_Tymes And if INTEL Soldered the lids people would Bitch, moan and complain that they cannot de-lid and apply their own TIM of choice. I very much dislike these bash INTEL articals, its tiring reading the same old hate on INTEL. keithplayspc nobody bitches about lids being solder…NO ONE. If it’s soldered you seriously can’t improve the temps and I’ve never met an enthusiast that ‘I wish they hadn’t soldered it so I could use worse performing TIM if I wanted to’ Seriously….think about it. Coach My initial thoughts regarding the new HEDT chips from Intel is that they are listed as having quite high clocks for this type of chip….great right? Well, with the above TIM information, I’m guessing that we will see a lot of throttling issues with these. They’ll be great chips but the paper may tout a bit more than we will see in reality. The competition has made this all very interesting. Nathan Kirsch We shall find out next month!

It came with an eye watering $1700 USD price and filled a prosumer niche for users who needed more cores, but didn’t want to invest in Intel’s Xeon enterprise ecosystem. Fast forward a year and 10 cores seems almost mid range with the announcement of the new high end X299 Platform and Core-X series of processors, squarely aimed at enthusiasts. The flagship of the range is a spectacular 18-core CPU, the i9-7980XE. It will have an equally spectacular price of $1999 USD. The i9-7980XE with its 18 cores is going to be well out of the reach of most users, but luckily there will be an entire range of processors available with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16-core variants. We’d expect the i7-7820X and i7-7800X to be around the sweet spot with 8 cores at $599 USD and 6 cores at $389 USD. As we saw with X79 and X99 platforms from Intel, all of the CPUs in the range will be fully multiplier unlocked, allowing for easy overclocking. The previous Broadwell models, in all their iterations were relatively poor overclockers. Skylake and Kaby Lake use an improved 14nm manufacturing process so we’re expecting overclocking to be significantly improved. The official turbo boost speeds point to this fact too. Do you fancy a 10 or 12 core CPU at 4.5 Ghz+ on all cores? This may (should?) be possible. It will be interesting to see how the 18 core model overclocks. We expect it will take a very very good motherboard and PWM system to be able to push it hard as the power consumption will go through the roof.     Note the two CPUs at the bottom of the slide above. These are the Kaby Lake-X processors. They are Socket 2066 versions of their mainstream Socket 1151 siblings. Some will question why Intel would release processors like these on the high end platform when you could buy a low end H110 motherboard and get the same performance. We actually think this is a good move from Intel. Critics of the X99 platform and it’s Broadwell-E based processors pointed to a lack of clock speed and overclocking capability as reason not to buy into the X99 platform. In many cases, a relatively cheap i7 7700K destroys a i7 6950X at a quarter of the price. This is something that didn’t quite fit with the high end desktop narrative. This dilemma is now solved, with X299 having a full range of processors that perform better than their Z270 counterparts. Buyers of the Kaby Lake X processors also have a very good upgrade path, with the platform likely to be relevant for at least a couple of years to come. There is little incentive to buy a high end Z270 motherboard now. Intel has yet to fully detail the specs for the high end Skylake-X parts. This would indicate some late fine tuning perhaps in response to the threat from AMD. Did the release of AMD’s Ryzen series of processors poke the bear? There’s no doubt that Ryzen was a massive step for AMD, offering higher core counts and competitive clock for clock performance. News of AMD’s 16 core Threadripper CPU and X399 platform surely contributed to Intel’s decision to accelerate the launch of their own platform, and perhaps introduce the models with the higher core counts. My 18 cores are better than your 16 cores! We’re also seeing the i9 branding for the first time, something that Intel has kept in the war chest for the best part of a decade. Whatever the reasoning for bringing out the big guns, a competitive AMD and Intel arms race can only benefit the consumer. Intel are aiming to release the first wave of Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs in late June. We’re looking forward to preparing our review and analysis then. The higher core count models will follow later. Of course we also have AMD’s Threadripper to look forward to as well. It’s looking like a very interesting time ahead in the PC world.

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

The company has also outed an important detail about its upcoming 8th generation Core CPUs for the mainstream. These will become available in the second half of this year, as successors to the currently selling 7th generation Core SKUs. Intel says the next generation chips will perform up to 30% better than the ones out today, at least in some circumstances and for some use cases. The company has seen such a boost in SYSmark 2014 version 1.5, and the quoted improvement applies only to the 15W U-series processors. Intel pitted a 7th generation Core i7-7500U CPU (two cores, four threads, 2.7-3.5GHz clock speed) against an unnamed next generation chip with four cores, eight threads, and 4GHz maximum clock speed in order to achieve the aforementioned result. Like the 6th and 7th generation Core processors, the 8th generation models will also be built using a 14nm process, but a "refined iteration" nevertheless. The new 8th gen architecture is codenamed Coffee Lake.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Computex / Computex: Intel promises 30% performance boost for 8th gen CPUs Computex: Intel promises 30% performance boost for 8th gen CPUs Matthew Wilson 5 days ago Computex, CPU, Featured Announcement We’ve had a lot of Intel news over the last 24 hours and while we have managed to tackle the bigger announcements, there was one small but interesting detail that snuck by during the Intel conference at Computex. In the midst of the big reveal for X299 and Skylake-X, Intel began talking about its future 8th generation CPUs, promising a 30 percent performance increase and availability before the end of the year. Intel’s upcoming 8th generation CPUs are currently code-named ‘Coffee Lake’ and during the press briefing, Intel claimed that while engineers were initially planning on a 15 percent performance improvement over 7th gen. However, it seems that the competitive landscape has now caused this to be bumped up to a 30 percent improvement. A 30 percent performance boost would be a very impressive generational bump, particularly given that yearly performance improvements have generally sat in the 10 to 15 percent range for the last few years. Aside from that, Intel says that great progress has been made with 8th gen already, so the company plans on having the first Coffee Lake CPUs out by the end of 2017, both in laptop and desktop form. For laptops, it is likely that we will see low-power U-series chips first, alongside OEM availability of some Coffee Lake CPUs some time before we get around to the 8600K or 8800K though. The usual Core i7s and Core i5s that the average custom PC builder can go out and buy will likely arrive later in the first half of 2018. This release timetable would be similar to what we observed with Kaby Lake last year.   KitGuru Says: A 30 percent generational leap certainly isn’t anything to scoff at. It will certainly keep things in the CPU market interesting as we edge closer to 2018.

It will only apply in very specific use cases.). jim k i agree Mike Laste I’ve been wanting to replace my 3470 for the same $200 price for a while and this may be the generation I do. 30% performance between mine and the 6500k in 5 years… seems like intel is spitting in my face. Dracono 30% performance boost, but they never specified it as 30% increase in IPC. This could mean many things from being limited to the platform Mobile or HEDT and where it improvement is affected, be it integrated GPU, better battery life, more cores etc. Mace ya face Intel has always referenced “performance boost” as meaning IPC, though I understand the skeptisism.

Usman Published 12:32 PM, May 30, 2017 Updated 12:59 PM, May 30, 2017 TAIPEI, Taiwan – Taiwanese firm Asus unveiled on Monday, May 29, their 2017 lineup of laptops, including what Asus chairman Jonney Shih described as "the world's thinnest convertible" and "the world's most prestigious laptop." Shih was referring to the ZenBook Flip S (UX30), a 2-in-1 convertible laptop and the ZenBook 3 Deluxe (UX490), respectively. Asus dubbed its product presentation "The Edge of Beyond" held at the HNBK International Convention Center at Computex 2017, which runs until June 3, Saturday. Also part of the company's revelations are the ZenBook Pro (UX550), which Shih described as "super powerful with compact design"; the VivoBook S15, trumpeted as a unit with a "thinner and lighter design"; and the VivoBook Pro 15, with its "unprecedented performance." The Asus chairman beamed pridefully as he called their new products as representative of "the new age of innovation." Shih took aim at Apple's MacBook Air, declaring that the ZenBook Flip S is thinner and lighter than the Apple product. On the software side, Shih boasted of the new products' support for new Windows 10 features, among them Windows Link, Windows Hello, Cortana and Modern Standby. "Today is all about our relentless effort in striving toward perfection. Our brand new ZenBook and VivoBook lineup truly goes to the edge of beyond, providing everyone with a new definition of thin, beautiful and powerful laptops," Shih said. Asus also highlighted its long partnership with Intel, calling onto the stage, Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's client computing group. "Asus has been at the forefront of delivering new technology and experiences for many years. Its stunning lineup of new ZenBook and VivoBook PCs, all powered by 7th-generation Intel Core processors, give people a choice of thin-and-light PCs that merge high performance with style," said Bryant.

It has less powerful and cheaper siblings, too. A teraflop of performance in an Intel desktop CPU? Yes, please. You'll need to shell out handsomely to get it, but Intel's new Core X processor family, unveiled on Tuesday, is designed to handle any task an extreme gamer or video editor can throw at it. Its flagship is the Intel Core i9 7980X Extreme Edition, which boasts 18 cores and and 36 threads. That chip will retail for $1,999, while the base Intel Core i5-7640X goes for $242. In between are seven new processors, and in a bit of a departure from recent Core CPU lineups, each one offers a different core count, base clock speed, and Turbo Boost version. As you step up the price ladder, each rung adds two processor cores and four threads, topping out at 16 cores and 32 threads for the Intel Core i9-7960X, which retails for $1,699. The more expensive the processor, the slower the clock speed too, at least in the initial tiers. That's due in part to Intel's improved Turbo Boost technology, which is designed to maximize both single-core and dual-core performance by choosing a "favored core" for each processing task. That means if you opt for the Intel Core i7-7740X, you'll get a 4.3GHz base clock speed that can increase to 4.5GHz thanks to Turbo Boost, while the Intel Core i9-7900X offers a base clock speed of 3.3GHz that can be boosted to either 4.3GHz or 4.5GHz thanks to the favored core selection. It's worth noting that we don't have availability details for each new processor SKU yet, nor did Intel announce the clock speeds or other specs of the Extreme Edition or the other top-of-the line Core i9 X-series CPUs. Still, the applications for the Core i9-series are clear: simultaneous video editing workloads like transcoding a file while you edit another one, or creating high-resolution graphics for use in virtual reality or 4K games. If you've been waiting for chips that will let you perform these tasks and you have the budget to spend what amounts to $100 per processor core, you'll want to pore over the product sheets for more on the new Core X lineup. But many people will end up comparing the SKUs that Intel announced today with their AMD Ryzen equivalents. In some of the matchups, as Anandtech notes, the Ryzen chips come in a generation behind in terms of performance but significantly cheaper.

Intel’s technology will be deployed at the three Champions Trophy host grounds – the Oval in London, Edgbaston in Birmingham, and Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. The aim of the project is to demonstrate how innovative technology can improve the experience of watching cricket matches and keep fans engaged with what is going on on the pitch by giving them access to more statistical data. “We love the fact that cricket is a numbers game, a 360-degree sport with angles and speed and strike and run rates that lends itself to using statistics and figures in storytelling,” said Anuj Dua, director of marketing for Intel’s New Technology Group. ICC CEO and former South African international Dave Richardson added: “Our long-term ambition is to make cricket the world’s favourite sport and one way to do this is to offer fans premium content, and by embracing technology.” The first element of the ICC’s bespoke smart cricket technology will comprise Intel Falcon 8 drones equipped with high-definition, infrared cameras that will be used to conduct advanced pitch analysis before each match. By overflying the pitch, the drones will generate rich visual data on grass cover, health and even pitch topology, which will be used to generate daily reports for use in live broadcasts. Meanwhile, Intel has developed a bat sensor tool – a clip-on module powered by its Curie technology – that is mounted on the handle of the cricket bat to track and generate data on each stroke played by the batsman. The sensor gathers data on parameters such as backlift, bat speed, impact angles and follow-through angles. Read more about IT in sport The growing trend of analytics in sports has caused much debate, and even though data-driven decisions can provide some benefits, they are not right for all occasions. Computer Weekly visited the Land Rover BAR sailing team in Portsmouth to find out how mobile innovation may help bring the America’s Cup back to the UK for the first time since 1851. To support this, Intel and the ICC have implemented a private ultra-wideband network – alongside the stadium Wi-Fi – to stream the data back to the match broadcasters, who can then make the statistics instantly available to TV viewers around the world. The final piece of the package will be a virtual reality (VR) showcase at the matches, which will use head-mounted displays to immerse fans in a virtual cricket match and let them test their batting skills against a virtual bowler using the Curie-powered smart bat. But both the ICC and Intel also see value beyond merely entertainment, and data gathered from the drones and the connected bats will also be made available to the teams and players to help them make strategic decisions ahead of, and during, the matches. Intel has also engaged Speculur, a manufacturer of wearable devices, to commercialise the bat sensor technology into a product called BatSense, which it hopes will help junior players improve their game. Ex-England captain and Sky Sports commentator Nasser Hussain, who now also coaches junior cricket, said he hoped BatSense could become an “absolutely vital” coaching tool in time.

Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 05.30.17. 05.30.17 Time of Publication: 3:48 pm. 3:48 pm Intel’s New Processors Are Built For the High-Powered Future of PCs Intel Corporation In recent years, the rollout of desktop processors has felt a bit stale. You generally know what you’re going to get: a little more power, a little more efficiency. And while Intel’s latest update doesn’t reinvent the chip, it does provide obscene horsepower at a time when that’s increasingly all that matters. The Core-X series ticks off the usual performance gains, with Intel claiming up to 10 percent faster multi-threaded and 15 percent single-thread performance over its predecessor. But the focus falls to the top-end, and a desktop chip so powerful that Intel carved out a new brand name for it: the Core i9. Uncommon Core The rebranding might sound like marketing hype, but it’s not—or at least not entirely. Intel’s Core i9 is the first consumer desktop processor to cram 18 cores and 36 threads into a single piece of silicon, a feat that enables the kind of full-throttle task-juggling that a world full of 4K video and virtual reality demands. Guts Galore Brian Barrett Intel’s Plan to Thunderbolt 3 All of the Things Cade Metz Intel Can’t Win Mobile, But It Owns the Cloud—For Now Brian Barrett The Flash Storage Revolution Is Here The more cores and threads a single CPU contains, the more dedicated tasks it can manage simultaneously without sacrificing performance. Is an 18-core, 36-thread processor overkill for most people? Sure! But for the right applications, it could be a lifesaver. “When it comes to people who are doing any type of video editing, this is like a dream come true,” says Patrick Moorhead, industry analyst and founder of Moor Insights & Strategy. “This is a big deal.” Video isn’t the only use case for Intel’s $1,700 monster truck CPU. Compiling code and running intensive virtual reality experiences could use the boost. And the real benefit goes to those who need to navigate several interrelated tasks at once, like live-streaming video games. “Streaming to Twitch is no light task,” says Moorhead. “Not only are you playing the games, you’re taking two to four threads and recoding that video and broadcasting it out on the internet. And then if you’re at the same time chatting with your friends, that’s probably one extra thread.” Intel Corporation The new Core X line should also have some trickle-down benefits for those not in need of ludicrous speed. Intel also upgraded its Turbo Boost tech, which now picks the two top-performing cores for single-threaded or light-threaded workloads—think gaming or basic office applications—to give even the entry-level Core X products some pick-up. Still, the high-end horsepower is the real draw, and it offers more than just bragging rights or edge-cases. Leading at the high end of consumer PCs matters because eventually, that’s the only end that will be left. Last PCs Standing Those who keep even a modest eye on consumer tech trends know that PCs don’t sell like they used to. Or actually, the problem is that they do sell like they used to: Last quarter, according to research firm Gartner, PC shipments dipped to the lowest levels since 2007. You can guess the reasons. Tablets and smartphones can now handle the bulk of home computing chores, while affordable, low-power Chromebooks pick up whatever slack remains. The PC makers still in business can look forward to fighting over the enterprise market for the foreseeable future—if they make it that long. “Vendors who do not have a strong presence in the business market will encounter major problems, and they will be forced to exit the PC market in the next five years,” wrote Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. Not bad, as far as doom and gloom goes. But it also belies the one consumer PC segment that’s not going bust. “The high-end desktop market is on fire,” says Moorhead. “It’s about 30 percent bigger than it was five years ago. It’s a really bright spot for the industry.” That growth stems from interest in Oculus-ready rigs, sure, but also the recent accessibility of 4K and 360-degree video. Mostly, it’s really the only kind of computing left for which you truly need a traditional computer. While Intel rightly may see its future in providing the chips that underpin cloud computing, it’s not about to cede ground on the last PC hill worth defending. You can see that impulse, too, in its recent efforts to spur Thunderbolt 3 adoption. As more and more data gets transferred over the air, the only hardware interface people will actually need is the one that can clock 40Gbps. So no, most PC owners today won’t be able to take full advantage of an 18-core, 36-thread behemoth. But that’s not really the point. Core X exists less for the present than it does for the future, one in which “extreme” becomes normal, because there’s nothing else left. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

At Computex in Taipei, Intel has unveiled the updated Core X-Series with a flagship Core i9 CPU and the company’s first teraflop desktop CPUs. The top-of-the-line Core i9 has an incredible 18 physical cores with Hyper-Threading for a total of 36 threads. It’s obscenely expensive, though. The Core X-Series consists of Core i9, i7, and i5 CPUs. The i3 isn’t welcome in what’s clearly intended as a high-end family of CPUs. The Core i5 7640X is the entry-level model in the X-Series. It only has four cores and no Hyper-Threading, just like current-gen mainstream i5 chips. However, it has a higher clock speed, supports faster RAM, and uses the new Intel Socket R4 (LGA 2066). It’s priced at a reasonable $242. If you want to step up to Intel’s new i7 family, the cheapest variant is the four-core, eight-thread 7740X. It’ll retail for $339, which is only a little more than current i7 CPUs. Things begin to diverge from existing Skylake and Kaby Lake designs with the 7800X, which has six cores and 12 threads for $389. There’s also the 8-core, 16-thread 7820X for around $599. That brings us to the new Core i9 lineup, which starts at 10 physical CPU cores with 20 threads. This 7900X chip will retail for $999. The other i9 CPUs come in configurations with 12, 14, 16, and 18 cores (all with Hyper-Threading). Intel’s recommended price for those is $1,199, $1,399, $1,699, and $1,999, respectively. The 7980XE is the first consumer chip to offer 18 cores, which will probably be overkill for almost everyone. The full X-Series lineup. The quad-core X-Series chips are based on Kaby Lake, but all the others are still derived from Skylake. Most of the improvements between those generations came in the form of power efficiency, but that’s not really what the X-Series is about. Intel says these chips are intended for gamers who want to play, livestream, and record their gameplay at high resolution. Anyone who needs to edit large images or videos might also be tempted to grab one of Intel’s new many-core CPUs. Of course, all X-Series CPUs are unlocked for easy overclocking. The X-Series chips plug into the new LGA2066 socket and are designed to work with the X299 chipset. The combination of high core counts and new chipset features should offer big performance gains compared with the last time Intel went beyond quad-core with Broadwell-E. These new CPUs will cost you a pretty penny, but a certain class of enthusiast and professionals will be happy to plunk down $2,000 for the fastest CPU Intel offers. Stay tuned for more analysis here on ExtremeTech, including how these processors stack up against AMD’s Ryzen lineup. Now read: L2 vs. L3 Cache: What’s the Difference?

With the focus firmly on enhancing the tournament experience for fans, players, media and broadcasters, the innovations will use data, analytics and visualization and ensure cricket remains at the forefront of technological advancements. The technology being introduced at the ICC Champions Trophy includes an Intel drone that will provide advanced pitch analysis, a bat sensor powered by an Intel Curie module that will allow for profiling of the bat swing and a VR experience for fans at the stadium. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our Official Innovation Partner of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, Chief Executive of the ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort." Intel Sports Group vice president Sandra Lopez highlighted the role of technology in transforming the way sport is played and viewed. With higher levels of digitisation, Intel is in a unique position to enable the sports industry to capture and analyze data to uncover and respond to new insights in real time. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitization and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," Lopez added. In a first at the Champions Trophy, the Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Sports News Cricket News England trio Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes to pioneer bat sensors in Champions Trophy (AFP) Shares40 Tue, 30 May 2017-11:05pm , PTI Technology giant Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift England trio Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes will be among the players from around the world pioneering new bat sensors during the upcoming Champions Trophy. Technology giant Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. The aim is to both provide more information to television audiences and, longer term, develop a coaching aid. Former England captain turned cricket broadcaster Nasser Hussain told a news conference at The Oval: "How many times have we spoken about people having 'fast hands' or 'great bat speed'? But what does that mean? We've never quantified it." Hussain, speaking ahead of the Champions Trophy opener between England and Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday, said he would have benefitted had this technology been available in his career. "When I first played for England, I had never really seen myself on television. I remember playing in Jamaica, getting out and walking through the hotel lobby and Geoffrey Boycott shouting at me 'Hussain, you'll never get any runs with that open bat face'. Something like this can show you the exact angle of your bat." Hussain said Roy, going through a run drought that has yielded four single figure scores in his last five one-day international innings, might gain from the new system. "Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say 'is everything I'm doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?' and if you know it was, you know that's not the issue." Hussain added: "There will be traditionalists thinking 'is this relevant?'. But if it gives you that one percent to improve the game, someone will be using it." Other innovations at the Champions Trophy include the use of high-technology drones to provide more in-depth pitch analysis and a virtual reality system that allows fans to experience what it's like to face the world's best bowlers. International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson, speaking alongside Hussain, welcomed the developments by saying: "If the technology is available to enhance and amplify the cricket experience, over the years we've shown a real willingness to trial and support it. "Our long-term vision is to make cricket the world's favourite sport and really there's only one way to achieve this -- to keep the fans engaged and interested in the game." The former South Africa wicket-keeper added: "That's all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology."

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe VR Intel and HTC tease upcoming WiGig accessory to untether the Vive Will Shanklin May 30, 2017 View gallery - 2 images PC virtual reality is going wireless soon – we've already tried accessories that successfully do just that. Today HTC announced another upcoming option, an accessory that uses Intel's WiGig technology to untether the Vive. Intel's WiGig (Wireless Gigabit), based on the 802.11ad standard, gives compatible PC accessories their own interference-free 60 GHz wireless band to connect cable-free, at high speeds (up to 7 Gbps). It sounds like an ideal match for PC-based VR, allowing for high-throughput and low-latency wireless headset connections. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW HTC and Intel were light on details today, but they did say the Vive accessory will provide "pristine video quality" with less than 7 ms latency, which should be practically imperceptible to the user. While high-end VR will eventually need lower pricing and more convenient setups to crack the mainstream, going wireless is another important box to tick. Along with the HTC-funded TPCast and offerings from lesser-known companies like KwikVR (both of which missed their original estimated launch windows), it's clear the VR industry is still pushing hard to untether PC headsets. If you're open to a mobile-VR alternative, Google is partnering with hardware makers (including HTC, above) to produce standalone/wireless Daydream headsets later this year. Oculus also teased its own standalone headset late last year, though we haven't heard anything about that since. There's no release or pricing info for the Intel/HTC WiGig accessory, but Intel will be showing off a proof of concept at E3 2017 in Los Angeles in June.

By Rob Thubron on May 30, 2017, 7:30 AM 63 comments TechSpot Just as expected, Intel has revealed its new family of enthusiast processors at Computex. At the top of the Core X-series sits its answer to AMD’s 16-core/32-thread Threadripper CPU: the $1999 i9-7980XE, which boasts an astounding 18 cores/36 threads. Intel says the i9-7980XE is the first ever teraflop desktop PC processor. Two grand is an awful lot of money, but this is the flagship chip; the rest of i9 X-series are cheaper. Available in 16-core, 14-core, 12-core, and 10-core versions, these Skylake-based chips range from $999 (for the ten core i9-7900X) to $1699. Intel says that compared to Broadwell-E chips such as the $1723 10-core i7-6950X, the new CPUs offer 15 percent faster single thread performance and are 10 percent faster when it comes to multithreaded tasks. The i9-7900X chip comes with a base clock speed of 3.3GHz, which jumps to 4.3GHz dual-core speeds when using Turbo Boost 2.0. And thanks to the improved Turbo Boost 3.0, which can dynamically identify and overclock the two “best” cores, it can hit 4.5GHz. Intel hasn't yet revealed the clock speeds for the rest of the Core i9 chips. For those on a tighter budget, there’s the Core i7 and i5 X-series CPUs. These include the only two Kaby Lake-X processors in the new line: the i5-7640X ($242) and i7-7740X ($339). All the Core X CPUs use the new X299 chipset (socket 2066), which boasts up to eight SATA 3.0 ports, up to ten USB 3.0 ports, and, when using CPUs with 10 cores or more, 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes All those cores mean things can get toasty. As such, Intel is selling its own liquid cooler designed for the 165W TDP and 140W TDP of the new chips. It's estimated retail price is between $80 - $100, and it also works with some previous generation CPU models. Both the new X-series processors and compatible motherboards should arrive “in the coming weeks.” Related Reads With the 9700-series, Intel lays the Itanium family to rest Intel unveils business-class SSD Pro 2500 Series with self-encryption Intel launches budget-minded 540s Series SSDs, pricing starts under $55 63 comments 678 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Logitech updates high-end mice: MX Master 2S and MX Anywhere 2S Intel Core X vs. AMD Ryzen Threadripper: What we know so far The Eve V is a feature-packed Surface Pro-like device that even Microsoft approves of Load Comments 63 ...

The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras, will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. “We couldn’t be more excited to have Intel as our ‘Official Innovation Partner’ of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017,” said David Richardson, CEO, ICC, on Tuesday. “The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort,” Richardson added in a statement. The bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. “Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports,” said Sandra Lopez, Vice President, Intel Sports Group. Intel will also showcase VR experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston, to allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session. “Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers,” said Atul Srivastava, Managing Director, Speculur which is a Bengaluru-based smart wearables and cognitive computing company. With “Speculur BatSense”, aspiring cricketers can measure, track and improve their batting skills. The company plans to make ‘Speculur BatSense’ available in Australia, India, the United States and Britain in the second half of this year.     Print       Email Published: 5 days ago on May 30, 2017 By: IANS Last Modified: May 30, 2017 @ 10:36 pm Filed Under: Sports NEXT ARTICLE → MRH FC gets revenge over MRH Sunrisers ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Maradona declines offer to commentate with Pele About the author IANS View all articles by IANS » LATEST NEWS Seven killed in London terror, three terrorists shot dead Nagaland BJP’s PAC wants dropped members reinstated Mokokchung’s regional leaders join Democratic Progressive Party Acharya calls for greater commitment to environment Negligence takes toll as disaster destroys Kohima road again Women to be allowed in combat role in Army,says Gen Bipin Rawat PM mishandling Kashmir issue: Rahul India’s heaviest rocket with GSAT-19 all set for maiden flight SEARCH Custom Search Sign up for our newsletter!

At Computex this week, the company officially launched the card with a full list of partners and what we can expect to see from them product-wise. These devices will all be at the show and vary widely. Sharp, for example, is showing off digital signage while Seneca and Foxconn are making mini PCs. LG is sticking the Compute Card in its monitors to turn them into all-in-ones. The card might also show up in tablets and interactive whiteboards. Nexdock will be showing something off, too, which we can assume is its touchscreen concept that it announced in January. Intel says the Compute Card will start shipping in August. Weirdly, Intel’s most well-known partners, including Lenovo, HP, and Dell, aren’t ready to show off their products. Intel says they’ll definitely create something but we don’t have an idea of what those devices might be. The compute card will be available in four variants: Image: Intel The company’s also putting out its design kit today that includes guides and reference designs for developers. The Compute Card might not take over, but it at least is giving us hope for a future of powerful pocket PCs.

CT 17 schedule and squads With the focus firmly on enhancing the tournament experience for fans, players, media and broadcasters, the innovations will use data, analytics and visualisation and ensure cricket remains at the forefront of technological advancements. The technology being introduced at the ICC Champions Trophy includes an Intel drone that will provide advanced pitch analysis, a bat sensor powered by an Intel® CurieTM module that will allow for profiling of the bat swing and a VR experience for fans at the stadium. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our Official Innovation Partner of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, Chief Executive of the ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort." Intel Sports Group Vice President Sandra Lopez highlighted the role of technology in transforming the way we play and view sports. With higher levels of digitization, Intel is in a unique position to enable the sports industry to capture and analyze data to uncover and respond to new insights in real time. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitization and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," Lopez added. In a first at the Champions Trophy, the Intel® FalconTM 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health, and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. The new bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. Analytics from the sensor will be available for fans to analyse. Speculur Managing Director Atul Srivastava added, "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers." "Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman's technique ultimately helping him perform better," Srivastava added. Speculur also announced plans to bring this technology to consumers later in the year. With Speculur BatSense, hundreds of thousands of young and aspiring cricketers will soon be able to measure, track and improve their batting skills. Speculur plans to make Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside available in Australia, India, the United States and the UK in the second half of 2017. Intel is also showcasing innovative experiences for in-stadium fans. Virtual Reality (VR) experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston will allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session.

Roston - May 30, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 7/10 Pros Ample ports Durable construction Classic ThinkPad design Long battery life Fingerprint reader Cons Thick bezels Bulky for an ultrabook Dim display Lenovo has released the second-generation version of its ThinkPad 13, a business ultrabook with the same no-nonsense style we’ve come to know and love. Unlike some ultrabooks, the ThinkPad 13 packs a bunch of ports that (most likely can) cover all of your workday needs, tossing other features on top including a fingerprint sensor and customizable hardware. Is the latest version worth the upgrade? Read on to find out! Hardware & Design The latest ThinkPad 13 comes in two flavors: black and sliver. Our review model is silver, as you can see in the photos, though you can also get it in the traditional black ThinkPad style if you prefer. This model falls on the ‘budget’ end of the ThinkPad lineup with a starting price of about $440 USD on Lenovo’s website, making it attractive from a monetary point of view, and it helps boost its appeal by offering a bunch of ports and long battery life. The ThinkPad 13 is designed for businesses, as well as anyone else who needs a durable, reliable laptop — students, teachers and similar. Lenovo boasts that its new laptop was tested across a dozen different military specifications, making it durable enough to handle your bumps and jostles while on the road or at the office. The company explains that the second-generation version of the ThinkPad 13 passed more than 200 quality checks, and it helps round out that attractive feature by offering a battery capable of taking you through a full workday (and perhaps longer). The design itself is basic and highly usable, including a large trackpad, red trackpoint nub, three trackpad buttons, and a fingerprint reader. The keyboard features a two-stage adjustable soft white backlight, which can be turned on and off by pressing Fn + Spacebar. All of this is joined by a 13.3-inch matte display with a Full HD resolution and IPS technology. The touchscreen is quite sensitive and accurate, and the viewing angles are excellent, though the screen still suffers from glares in bright environments despite its non-glossy nature. MacBook Air 13-inch and ThinkPad 13 2nd-gen The design is simplistic and fairly angular; as far as ultrabooks go, it’s also a bit beefy as shown above and heavy with a starting weight of 3.17lbs. That’s not surprising given the number of ports Lenovo packs into this machine, but it should be noted that there are thinner ThinkPad alternatives (like the X1 Carbon) if thinness is important to you. TECH SPECS Processor: – Up to Intel® Core™ i5-7300U Processor (3MB Cache, up to 3.50GHz) – Up to Intel® Celeron® 3865U Processor (2MB Cache, 1.80GHz) Operating System: – Windows 10 Home – Windows 10 Pro – Lenovo recommends Windows 10 Pro Display: – 13.3″ HD (1366 x 768) TN Anti-Glare – 13.3″ FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS Anti-Glare Multi-Touch Storage: – Up to 128GB SSD – Up to 256GB SSD OPAL2.0 Memory: Up to 16GB DDR4 2133 MHz Audio: HD Audio Security: – dTPM 2.0 – Swipe fingerprint reader Camera: 720p HD camera with integrated dual array microphone Graphics: Up to Intel® HD Graphics 610 Battery: Up to 11 hours Ports: – 2 x USB 3.0 – 1 x USB 3.0 (powered) – 1 x USB-C – 1 x HDMI – OneLink+ – 4-in-1 card reader (SD, SD-HC, SD-XC, MMC) – 1 x headphone / microphone combo jack Connectivity: Intel® Dual Band Wireless AC (2×2) 8265 + Bluetooth® 4.1 Dimensions: 12.69″ x 8.77″ x 0.77″ / 322.4 mm x 222.8 mm x 19.8 mm Weight: Starting at 3.17 lbs / 1.44 kg Color: Silver Software & Performance One important element we hope to see in business laptops is the ability to get through a full work day on a single charge. While that may not be important for desk jockeys, anyone who travels with any sort of regularity knows the hassle of having to charge mid-way through the day. The ThinkPad 13 is able to meet this need, offering up to 11 hours of run time per charge depending on usage. I was able to successfully use the next-gen ThinkPad 13 through a full 10ish hour workday with a bit of charge to spare, though the battery indicator was close to empty at this point. That’s perhaps skirting too closely to the charge point for some users, but I was pleased with the results. Performance, meanwhile, was great during average usage — that is, web browsing, photo editing, and similar. Your experiences will vary based on your laptop’s own configuration, however; Lenovo offers up to a Core i5 or up to an Intel Celeron 3865U Processor, 16GB of RAM, and up to Intel HD Graphics 610. The laptop runs Windows 10 and includes some of Lenovo’s own software preinstalled. Things we like The ThinkPad 13 is the type of laptop I call utilitarian — it’s more about function than form, and there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s no single thing that stands out among competing products. Rather, the laptop as a whole brings a variety of items that will appeal to certain users: many ports, a matte display, touchscreen, relatively thin profile, excellent keyboard, and great audio quality. Issues While the ThinkPad 13 is mostly a great laptop, the screen was disappointing. I caught myself attempting to turn up the brightness a couple times, only to realize that it was still turned up to max brightness. It truly felt too dim in most environments with the exception of dark ones, and that was a problem for me. After using this ThinkPad model for a day, I felt that I was developing eye strain and had to resist the urge to use an external monitor. Your mileage may vary, but for me personally, the next-gen ThinkPad 13’s screen is lacking. Wrap-up If you’re in the market for a ThinkPad but you can’t drop several hundred on one of the higher-end models, Lenovo has a great compromise in the ThinkPad 13. While you’re not getting the thinnest ultrabook out there nor a bright 4K display, you will enjoy a combination of long battery life, multiple hardware options, a touchscreen, many ports (including USB-C), and a comfortable keyboard. If all that sounds perfect, you can pick up the ThinkPad 13 (2017) from Lenovo’s website starting at $439 USD.

News & Analysis Apple, Intel Attack Rivals SoC hire, new CPUs hit Qcomm, AMD Rick Merritt 5/30/2017 02:00 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Apple and Intel got an edge on rivals in separate moves that came to light Tuesday (May 30), showing heated competition in semiconductors. Apple hired a top Qualcomm engineering manager expected to lead its SoC efforts while Intel announced a new high-end PC processor family, leapfrogging renewed competition from Advanced Micro Devices. Apple hired Esin Terzioglu, a vice president of engineering who led the central engineering group at Qualcomm’s semiconductor division for the last eight years. For its part, Intel announced its Core i9 Extreme Edition family, including an 18 core, 36 thread chip that leapfrogs AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper, a 16 core, 32 thread chip announced in mid-May. Terzioglu announced his move in a LinkedIn post made public in a tweet by Neil Shah, an analyst for Counterpoint Research. Terzioglu has not updated his LinkedIn page to provide his new title at Apple, but given his experience observers expect he will lead Apple’s semiconductor efforts, perhaps launching a foray into creating the company’s own baseband processor. The move comes at a time when Apple is locked in a major legal battle with Qualcomm over as much as $2 billion in annual royalties it charges for its cellular communications patents. Last year, Apple started using baseband chips from Intel. Apple filed suit against Qualcomm in January, claiming that Qualcomm’s royalties were exorbitant and the chip vendor pressured it to remain silent. In a countersuit filed in April , Qualcomm said that it paid Apple to refrain from asserting patents and revealed that it got royalty payments for iPhones and iPads through Apple’s contract manufacturers including Compal, Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron. Before joining Qualcomm, Terzioglu was CTO and CFO of startup Novelics, acquired by Mentor Graphics. Previously he served six years as a principal scientist in the office of the CTO at Broadcom. He holds a doctorate and masters in electrical engineering from Stanford. “It does seem Apple increasingly wants to design almost everything in the iPhone,” said Mike Demler, an analyst with the Linley Group. “If you look at its patent filings its obvious Apple has been doing a lot of work in baseband radios for the past few years and they might even try to design their whole RF signal chain,” he said. In addition, Apple recently informed Imagination Technologies it intends to design its own mobile GPUs.

This includes an all-new approach to media analysis, as well as a chance for cricket aficionados to get a real hands-on experience that will help them improve their own game. However fans attending any of the games at Lord’s and The Oval in London, as well as Edgbaston in Birmingham, will be able to benefit from free and fast Wi-Fi in the stadium, as well as enjoy a futuristic Virtual Reality experience that puts them at the heart of the action. In a first for a sports tournament in England, Intel-powered drones will scan every inch of the wicket at the three grounds to provide in-depth information on the state of the pitch, crucial information for players, fans and commentators alike. For example, the scans (example pictured below) would give real-time information on how the pitch is faring during the day’s play, and whether it would benefit spin or seam play. “Our long term vision is to make cricket the world’s most popular sport, and we need to engage the fans,” ICC CEO David Richardson (pictured above) said at the launch event at the Oval today. “We need to offer premium content and use technology”, he added, “If the technology is available to enhance the cricketing experience, then over the years we’ve shown a  willingness to support it.” For players fans looking for that little extra, Intel, which has previously partnered with major sports tournaments including Spain’s La Liga football and the PGA golf circuit, is also supporting the launch of BatSense, a new service which allows players to monitor their own performance. Taking the form of a small accessory that clips onto the top of a cricket bat, the product contains a multitude of sensors that will provide real-time information on their stance, movement and even the speed they swing their bat. This information can then be used to create a 3D avatar of the player, allowing them to analyse their strengths and weaknesses in a far more advanced way than has ever been available before. “We think this of a technology that can be the difference between playing club cricket and international cricket,” Intel’s Anuj Dua declared. BatSense will be used by a number of top players during the ICC Champions Trophy, before going on public sale in August across the world.

The new Core i9 is aimed at enthusiasts and power users. It offers up to 18 processing cores. The Core branding began with the Core 2 Duo, the chip that saw Intel regain the top of the market from rival AMD. It has held that position ever since with AMD struggling to create compelling high-end options. The status quo is now shifting though. Earlier this year, AMD unveiled its all-new Ryzen series of processors, its most competitive range in half a decade. Ryzen's price to performance ratio is far higher than the Intel Core series. Whereas Intel's cheapest eight-core chip retails at over $1,000, AMD offers a flagship model for $499. A few weeks ago, AMD went a step further, announcing it will start selling a 16-core, 32-thread chip later this year. AMD's long-anticipated return to competition has now forced Intel into action. At the Computex computer show in Taiwan today, Intel made official what rumours have been suggesting for weeks. It is responding to Ryzen by adding a new series to the Core family. Branded as "Core i9" and part of the wider Core X enthusiast offering, the options range from 4 cores and 4 threads right up to 18 cores and 36 threads. Intel's new Core i9 processors Intel Intriguingly, this span doesn't align with the initial Core i9 rumours from a couple of months ago. PC Gamer reports that the slides Intel distributed to media at Computex ahead of the event only mentioned 12-core parts. Intel's executives launched the Core i9 onstage without accompanying background material, releasing the official images later on. Intel claimed it has kept the 18-core models close to home to prevent details leaking out. Many have speculated that they're actually a late addition though. The company may have decided to launch them earlier than intended after AMD revealed the 16-core "Threadripper." Aware that AMD was about to steal headlines once again, it's possible Intel has been forced to take defensive action for the first time in years. Even today, Intel hasn't publicly detailed the specifications for the highest end parts. Clock speeds, memory support and power consumption figures for the most important Core i9 components remain conspicuously lacking. Intel has revealed pricing details though, confirming that an 18-core desktop chip will set you back $1,999. 16-core, 14-core, 12-core and 10-core options will retail at $1,699, $1,399, $1,199 and $999 respectively. At the lower end of the range, Intel is also offering new more conventional processors for gamers and less demanding enthusiasts. Its new flagship Core i7 chip, the i7-7740X, offers 4 cores and 8 threads for $339. It has a base clock speed of 4.3GHz and can turbo up to 4.5GHz. There are also 6-core and 8-core i7 variants priced under $600 and a $242 Core i5. With four cores, four threads and a 4.0GHz base clock, this chip is likely to become the processor of choice for new gaming builds later this year. Intel new Core X processors Intel Intel said it has decided to launch an 18-core desktop processor because its 10-core i7-6950X was received "really well" by enthusiasts. The company's repeated claims that it's not merely trying to one-up AMD haven't held water with analysts though. While it's not willing to directly admit it, it seems as though the classic rivalry between AMD and Intel is returning in full force. "The Intel® Core™ X-series processor family introduces a series of firsts that reflect the extreme performance we are delivering," said Intel's Gregory Bryant. "This family includes Intel’s first teraflop desktop CPUs, a prime example of just how much raw compute these processors can handle. We’re also introducing the entirely new Intel® Core™ i9 processor, representing the highest performance for advanced gaming, VR and content creation." With the core count on desktop processors finally being forced up, the renewed competition will lead to more powerful computers at lower prices. The new Core i9 range will be available later this year. They'll be joined in the second half of 2017 by Intel's upcoming "Coffee Lake" series of Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, promising up to 30% higher performance than the outgoing Kaby Lake series.

favorites Intel has launched its X-series processor with 18-core i9 chips to accelerate the data-driven vision of the connected future. At this year’s opening keynote at Computex, Intel GM Gregory Bryant took to the Taipei stage to push Intel’s data-driven vision of the future. Such is this vision that Intel is willing to cast off the moniker of PC giant in favour of becoming a data company. The GM went through the motions like any other big exec delivering a keynote – Bryant mentioned the anticipated 80 billion devices by 2025, autonomous cars becoming mainstream and how Intel wants to position itself, like other big tech, at the forefront of this data-driven revolution. The race is on to grab a share of the lucrative ‘data-driven’ market, but Intel has an ace up its sleeve – its chips and hardware can power every segment of the data journey – from the cloud and network to the device. In support of this vision, the chip giant Intel introduced the new Intel Core X-series processor family, which is designed to power performance at scale. In a blog post, Bryant said: “The Intel Core X-series processor family introduces a series of firsts that reflect the extreme performance we are delivering. This family includes Intel’s first teraflop desktop CPUs, a prime example of just how much raw compute these processors can handle. Read more: Intel’s Thunderbolt 3-for-all adds USB-C to all CPUs “We’re also introducing the entirely new Intel Core i9 processor, representing the highest performance for advanced gaming, VR and content creation. At the top of the lineup is the new Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor – the first consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads.” Intel also introduced a new X299 chipset, which includes more I/O and overclocking capabilities that enable Intel to launch HEDT processors on Skylake. This delivers high-performance rates as content creators are provided with fast image rendering, video encoding, audio production and real-time preview in order to spend less time waiting and more time creating. For gamers, the new capabilities enable them to play games whilst also streaming, recording and encoding their gameplay that they can share on social media. This can be accessed with a selection of screens for a 12K experience that will include up to four graphic cards. The GM also gave a sneak preview of the much anticipated 8th generation of Core processor-based devices later this year, which will drive performance at a rate of over 30% improvement compared to the 7th generation. Other announcements include the release of always-connected PCs, which in collaboration with Microsoft, Intel delivers high performance with Windows experiences, longer battery life and connectivity all built-in to a thin PC. Latest devices shown include Lenovo’s Yoga 720 with an H-series processor and Acer’s Predator Triton which has launched today. Still innovating with connected devices, Intel also launched a new Compute Card that enables devices outside of PCs to be connected to VR headsets. The Intel Compute Card will begin shipping in August 2017.

May 2017 Add to favorites The chip maker is hoping to hit a six with its tech enabled cricket revolution. The cricket season is back with a bang with the ICC Champions Trophy due to kick off on Thursday and Intel is hoping to score big with some new innovations to the sport. With drones, Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality advancements, Intel and the International Cricket Council are hoping to deliver the first smart cricket tournament. The first of the announcements is a cricket bat that has an Intel Curie module attached to it. The device, created by Speculur and called Speculur BatSense, uses the Intel Curie module mounted on the bat to generate data from every stroke that the batsman plays. This means that the batsman can see data on things like back-lift, bat speed, and follow-through. The device, which will be launched globally in August this year, will be used during the event by several batsmen.

News and Press Release Distribution, Since 1995 Deliver Your News to the World Sign In Create a Free Account Home News How We Work Compare Services FAQ All WebPost WebPost PPC WebRelease Targeted Media Wire Service ASUS Introduces New X299 Based Motherboards Based on Intels X299 chipset, the ROG, Prime and TUF series feature state-of-the-art connectivity and control options designed for gamers, power users and prosumers Taipei, Taiwan – WEBWIRE – Tuesday, May 30, 2017 ASUS - ROG Rampage VI Extreme A new era of high-end desktops is here. Intel® just took the wraps off its long-awaited Core X-Series processors and accompanying X299 chipset, which bring enough horsepower and bandwidth for everything from professional content creation to hardcore gaming. The new LGA2066 processors require new motherboards, and ASUS has a diverse lineup split between the Prime, TUF, and ROG families. ROG has three models expertly tailored for different priorities: the Rampage VI Extreme lives up to its name for drool-worthy dream machines with custom liquid cooling and ultra-fast networking, the Rampage VI Apex unabashedly targets peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking, and the Strix X299-E provides gamers the powerful tuning, cooling, and personalization options they need to get the most from their rigs.  ROG does more than just offer checkbox featureswe take the time to ensure each one is empowering for enthusiasts and accessible for beginners. The Prime and TUF models are designed for differing audiences: new Prime X299-Deluxe is for high-end builders who want it all, the Prime X299-A eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics, the TUF X299 Mark 1 stands out from its competitors with protective armor and advanced cooling options, while the TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down to the essentials for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula. The new ASUS Prime and TUF X299s series are a breath of fresh air at a time when far too many motherboards offer more of the same. Shared Innovations Define The ROG X299 Family All three boards share the same DNAessential features that enthusiasts in the Republic of Gamers demand. That starts with critically acclaimed overclocking and cooling controls for liquid and air. There are dedicated pump headers for powering custom loops and all-in-one coolers, plus intelligent fan controls for optimal efficiency and quiet acoustics. Sensor grouping lets your cooling react to a mix of workloads, including GPU-heavy gaming via direct temperature monitoring for select graphics cards. Tuning your gaming PC is easy whether you want to perfect your setup with manual tweaking or automatically configure and overclock the whole thing with a single click using our 5-Way Optimization utility. Speaking of overclocking, our experts have already used the Rampage VI Apex to take 8 world records and 20 global records with the Core X-processor reaching 7.560GHz, and were just getting started. Expect more records to fall as we cement ROGs legacy as the absolute performance leader. Gaming PCs provide unprecedented options to express your style, including through personalized lighting. The RGB LEDs embedded on our boards are augmented by headers for multiple RGB LED strips to illuminate your entire chassis. All of the lighting is part of our Aura Sync ecosystem, which synchronizes harmoniously across compatible ROG graphics cards, peripherals, and monitors, along with other components from our partners. Equipped with the latest generation of SupremeFX integrated audio, ROGs new X299 motherboards boast enhanced recording quality for streamers who want their voice to come through clearly. Graphics cards plug into reinforced SafeSlots that protect against damage from heavy GPU coolers and rough handling. Intels VROC technology combines with our optional add-in card to enable insane M.2 RAID arrays made up of a stack of parallel drives with a direct line to the CPU. You can hit ludicrous speeds with enough capacity for overflowing game libraries. You get all the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports and internal headers pushing speeds up to 10Gbps. Onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking are standard equipment, and you can add Intels new Optane memory as a high-speed cache.  Prime Time For X299 Built for power users and prosumers, the Prime series represents the culmination of decades of experience refining all aspects of motherboard technology. These boards mate state-of-the-art connectivity with accessible tuning options to provide a premium experience everyone can enjoy. All of our X299 motherboards have extensive overclocking and cooling options available in both the UEFI and software. The Primes go one step further with 5-Way Optimization, which intelligently overclocks your system and tunes the cooling based on the individual characteristics of your components. Beginners can effortlessly optimize their entire PC with a single click, while experienced users can adjust tuning parameters to meet their needs. Refinement extends to the styling, whose predominantly black-and-white theme lays the perfect foundation for understated buildsor much flashier ones with RGB lighting. Our Prime X299 boards feature multiple headers for LED strips that can light up your entire chassis. Theyre part of a rich ecosystem of Aura Sync products that can synchronize colors and effects across a complete system, from the motherboard and graphics card to peripherals and other components. Intels new Core X-Series processors demand serious cooling, which is why all of our new X299 motherboards have dedicated headers for all-in-one liquid coolers and stand-alone pumps.  Our Prime X299 series also support up to three-way graphics configurations, and their x16 slots incorporate structural reinforcements with our SafeSlot technology to prevent damage and protect your investment. PCIe lanes left unused by graphics can be devoted to storage with VROC, which combines multiple M.2 SSDs in a bootable RAID array connected directly to the CPU. An insane number of drives can run in parallel across multiple VROC cards to deliver staggering throughput and warp fast access for system drives. Intels Optane memory technology is supported, which provides a solid-state cache to accelerate other storage devices. This new Prime series receives our latest on-board audio enhancements, including a Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier and premium components that produce immersive and crystal clear sound which rivals some dedicated sound cards. TUF Enough To Endure Our Prime X299 motherboards are balanced by entries from the TUF family. These models march to a different beat that prioritizes reliability and durability for PCs built to go the distance. They use tougher components than conventional counterparts, and theyre subjected to more stringent testing. Shifting focus requires a new outlook, and TUF answers with distinctive designs that meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine. Stealthy by nature, the new boards minimize RGB lighting to concentrate on different priorities. Availability & Pricing ROG Rampage VI Extreme, Rampage VI Apex and ROG Strix X299-E motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June with the Strix series arriving first.  ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe, Prime X299-A and TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboards will be available at leading resellers in starting in late June.  Suggested MSRP pricing will be announced on 6/26/2017.

Instead, the company has detailed the Intel Compute Card at Computex 2017 this week, effectively a full Windows PC squeezed into something the size of a credit card. Intel is betting on it igniting a new age of modular computing. We first saw hints of what Compute Card could do back at CES in January. Then, Intel was promising the unusual combination of a regular CPU – albeit a fairly low-power one – in a 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm enclosure. Manufacturers could add a Compute Card slot to their devices, allowing users to slot in a chunk of processing power if they wanted more advanced features in their smart fridge, for instance, or connected camera. Upgrades would be more straightforward in future, too, while those who didn’t want the advanced functionality could ignore the slot altogether. Now, we know just what’s inside those little cards. Four versions of the Intel Compute Card will be offered initially, running the gamut from an affordable Celeron up to a full Core i5. All will include not only the processor, storage, and memory, but wireless connectivity. The range kicks off with a Celeron N3450, paired with 64GB of eMMC storage and Intel Wireless AC 7265 with WiFi 802.11ac 2×2 and Bluetooth 4.2. A step up gets you the Pentium N4200 in its stead. Both have 4GB of DDR3 memory. A 7th-Gen Core i3 m3-7Y30 comes inside the third Compute Card model, also with 4GB of DDR3 memory but now hooked up to a 128GB Intel SSD for storage. It upgrades the wireless chipset, too, to Intel’s Wireless AC 8265 with faster 802.11ac 2×2 WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2. Finally, the most powerful Compute Card variant has a 7th-Gen Intel Core i5-7Y57 processor. Importantly, while the credit-card sized PC may be fully functional, it won’t work on its own. There’s no battery inside, for a start, since it gets power when it’s plugged into another device; nor does it have regular connectivity. If you want to actually use it, you’ll need some sort of enclosure. Eventually Intel expects those enclosures to include laptop chassis which can be instantly upgraded by slotting in a new Compute Card, desktop PCs which are “dumb” until the Compute Card is installed, and displays which can be instantly made connected. For the reference design, though, it’s a simple desktop dock. That has a slot for the Compute Card on one side, and then a bevy of ports to go with it. Three USB ports – at least two of which are USB 3.0 – along with ethernet, DisplayPort, and HDMI aren’t bad going considering the tiny footprint. Of course not all devices with a Compute Card will have the same, since it’ll depend on what the OEM responsible decides is appropriate. OEMs are already lining up to use the modular design, however. Dell, HP, and Lenovo are already working on products, while LG Display, Sharp, Foxconn, and others are showing gadgets using Compute Card at Computex this week. NexDock has already announced that its laptop will use the Compute Card for its smarts. The Intel Compute Card is a modular computing platform with all the elements of a full computer, including Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options. It is slightly longer than a credit card at 95mm x 55mm x 5mm and can plug into a dock.

Computex 2017: Asus reveals a ton of new ZenBooks and Vivobooks by Tony Thomas  11:13 AM on May 29, 2017 Happy Memorial Day, gerbils. While you're presumably kicking back with a hot dog and beer, we're in balmy Taipei, Taiwan for the kickoff of Computex 2017. The first event of substance was a combined press conference by Asus and Intel. Asus chairman Jonney Shih took to the stage to unveil the company's latest and greatest laptops. Steel yourself for a lot of superlatives. Zenbook Flip S Asus opened with the most interesting product of the bunch, the ZenBook Flip S. Introduced as "the world's thinnest convertible laptop," the Flip S measures 0.4" (10.9 mm) thick and weighs 2.4 lbs (or 1.1 kg). The company was quick to point out that Flip S is about 20% thinner than the MacBook and 55% thinner than the Macbook Air. Zenbook Flip S The convertible's 360° rotating hinge was touted as "mesmerizing as a ballet dancer." Setting aside the odd simile, the hinge felt robust and rotated smoothly during our brief hands-on with the device. The Flip S transforms easily between a traditional laptop, a tent format, and tablet form. Regardless of the form, the Flip S proved to be quite fingerprint-prone, so Asus staff regularly swooped in for a microfiber wipe-down. The Flip S sports a 13.3" 4K display with a mere 0.24" (6.1 mm) bezel. Taking a leaf out of Dell's "InfinityEdge" book, Asus has slapped a "NanoEdge" branding on its new lineup of narrow-bezeled notebook displays. The machine also supports Windows Ink and Windows Hello. To take advantage of Ink, users must avail themselves of the Asus Pen with 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity. Asus didn't say whether a Pen would be bundled with the Flip S, but we'd bet it'll have to be purchased separately. On the Hello front, there's fingerprint sensor integrated into the right edge of the display's bezel. So well-integrated, in fact, that it wasn't readily discernible when I had the device in hand. Zenbook Flip S Now for what's under the hood. In what is presumably its highest configuration, the Flip S is powered by an unspecified Core i7 ultrabook processor with a turbo clock of 3.5 GHz. Intel's Gregory Bryant later made passing mention of Asus' use of seventh-generation Intel processors in its new lineup, so we wager the CPU inside the Flip S is the Core i7-7500U. 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD are along for the ride. The specs are rounded out by a 39 WHr battery that's allegedly good for 11.5 hours of computing. Asus says its fast-charging technology will take that battery from 0% to 60% in 49 minutes. When it's available later this year, the ZenBook Flip S will start at $1099. Rest assured that the configuration outlined above will cost substantially more. Zenbook 3 Deluxe Next up was the ZenBook 3 Deluxe, the 'world's thinnest 14" laptop.' In the same way that Dell calls the XPS 13 a 13" laptop in an 11" body, Asus is styling the ZenBook 3 Deluxe as a 14" laptop in a 13" chassis. The 0.5" (13 mm) thick all-metal body and 2.4 lbs (1.1 kg) weight make for a svelte package. Alas, whatever "aerospace-grade" metal the Zenbook 3 Deluxe is made out of doesn't appear to be any better at repelling fingerprints than the material used for the Flip S. Unlike that model, the Zenbook 3 Deluxe has a glass-covered touchpad and a fully-backlit keyboard. Zenbook 3 Deluxe Asus didn't make the 14" NanoEdge display's resolution known, so it's a fair bet that it's not 4K. However, the company was proud to announce that the ZenBook 3 Deluxe is the first laptop display armed with Corning's Gorilla Glass 5. Users at the bleeding edge of peripheral connectivity will be glad to hear that there are two USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 support. Asus asserts that there's enough bandwidth on tap for the machine to drive two external 4K displays simultaneously. In its most powerful configuration, the Zenbook 3 Deluxe is powered by an again-unspecified Core i7 CPU, a 1TB PCIe SSD, and 16GB of RAM. The starting price for this machine is $1199. Zenbook Pro To make for a smudgy metal trifecta, Asus trotted out a new ZenBook Pro. This time around, the guts of the machine were the main focus. The ZenBook Pro has a discrete graphics card—a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti—and a quad-core H-series Core i7 CPU. The flagship configuration again sports a 1TB PCIe SSD and 16GB of RAM. This time around, though, the RAM is 2400 MT/s DDR4. All that grunt drives a 15.6" NanoEdge 4K display, which the company says covers 100% of the sRGB color space. If that display isn't to your liking, the Pro's pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports will let you easily connect an external monitor. At 0.75" thick (or 19 mm) and 4 lbs (1.8 kg), the updated machine is considerably heftier than its non-Pro siblings, but it's nonetheless the thinnest and lightest ZenBook Pro yet. Some of that heft comes from a 73 WHr battery rated for 14 hours of use. Despite the larger capacity, Asus says its fast-charging technology will again take the battery from 0% to 60% in 49 minutes. The Pro again ratchets the price up a notch, starting at $1299. Vivobook S Lastly, Asus debuted a pair of VivoBooks. The company considers its VivoBooks "mainstream notebooks," as opposed to the more enthusiast-oriented ZenBook line. The VivoBook S is surprisingly trim for a non-ultrabook: only 0.71" (18 mm) thick and weighing in at 3.3 lbs (or 1.5 kg). Inside, you'll find a Core i7 U-series processor, a GeForce 940MX graphics card, up to 2TB of spinning rust or 512GB of solid-state goodness, and up to 16GB of 2133 MT/s DDR4 memory. The big hook for the VivoBook S is the price. Even at $499, you still get a 15.6" 1080p NanoEdge display and Asus' fast-charging tech. Yet again, Asus delivers an absurdly consistent estimate that the battery will go from 0% to 60% in 49 minutes. Vivobook Pro The VivoBook Pro, as you might expect, is a bit more of an upmarket machine. Its aluminum body rings in at 0.76" (19.2 mm) thick and 5 lbs (or 2.3 kg), but with great size comes, er, great hardware. You can ratchet the VivoBook Pro all the way up to a quad-core Core i7-7700HQ accompanied by 16GB of DDR4 and a GeForce GTX 1050. In addition to the 2TB HDD and 512GB SSD options, you can apparently provision the VivoBook Pro with Optane Memory, though Jonney Shih didn't delve into more detail here. On the outside, the VivoBook Pro packs a 4K display covering 100% of the sRGB space and a fully backlit keyboard. Starting price is set at $799.

Aorus X299 boards keep Core X PCs cool and colorful by Bruno Ferreira  6:00 AM on May 30, 2017 The impending release of Intel's X299 high-end desktop platform has been one of the worst-kept secrets in the industry lately. There have been jokes running around the TR Slack of late about referring to it as another buffalo, but the overall reaction was "eh, why bother?" The chipset is out, the socket is LGA 2066, and Gigabyte has four super-fancy boards ready for Intel's Core X-series CPUs. Meet the Aorus X299 Gaming series. We'll talk about four models in turn, but let's first take a look at all of the common features among them. The high-endness of these offerings is quite visible from the outset, since the boards pack a massive backplate. Depending on the exact model, there are RGB LEDs with Gigabyte's RGB Fusion software running the show. One might find RGB LEDs around the PCIe slots, DIMM sockets, and even on the I/O shield on these boards. Around the back, there are Type-C port and Type-A connectors, and another four USB 3.0 ports. All models also include a total of 8 hybrid fan headers, seven thermal sensors, two headers for thermistors, and a 3A header specifically for juicing up pumps. It's safe to say that even the most affordable model in the series is high-end enough. The Aorus X299 Gaming 3 couples the features above with two M.2 sockets, an Intel Ethernet adapter, and six-zone RGB LED lighting. Moving up the range, we find the Aorus X299 Ultra Gaming, which we figure represents the "just right" offering in the series. This model also comes with an Intel Ethernet adapter, but it has three M.2 slots and a header for a front-panel USB 3.1 Type-C connector. The Aorus Gaming 7 gets a little more serious. In addition to the features above, it packs a dual-Ethernet setup with both Killer and Intel Ethernet controllers, along with a Killer 1535 Wi-Fi adapter. The audio section gets a boost, too, thanks to the presence of an ESS Sabre DAC and TI op-amps. As an additional nod to audiophiles, this board has two of Gigabyte's DAC-Up 2 USB ports, which purportedly offer less electrical noise than the regular ones, for the purpose of plugging in external audio gear. Finishing touches on this model include four USB 3.1 Type-A ports, a total of eight LED zones, three M.2 slots with heatsinks, and Gigabyte's Q-Flash Plus functionality for updating firmware without a CPU. The final model in the series is the Aorus X299 Gaming 9. This version builds on the features of the Gaming 7 model above, but comes with an M.2-to-U.2 adapter and an M.2 add-in card. This model also comes with an acrylic I/O shield with RGB LED lighting, plus a massive backplate reinforcing nearly the full area of the board. Pricing for these mobos hasn't been revealed, but our eight-ball says "not cheap." Tags: Motherboards Chipsets Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Asus starts its X299 assault with seven motherboards by Zak Killian  6:00 AM on May 30, 2017 So you're all hyped and ready to plunk down the considerable chunk of change for an Intel Core i9 CPU. The question is, what motherboard should you put it in? Asus is ready with no less than seven boards equipped with the requisite X299 chipset for your shiny new CPU. Three models from the Republic of Gamers are joined by two "Prime" boards and two board from the company's TUF series. Asus ROG Strix X299-E The finest model in Asus' new fleet of fancy motherboards is the Rampage VI Extreme. Asus says this flagship motherboard is designed specifically for custom-loop liquid-cooling, and intended for "showcase" PCs. It has a specific connector to let waterblocks provide flow rate, temperature, and leakage data to the system. It also has two more headers onboard specifically for monitoring the flow rate through your loop. Like previous Rampage Extreme boards from Asus, the new model includes everything and the kitchen sink. That means you get 10-Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ad Wi-Fi, triple M.2 slots, on-board Thunderbolt 3, and even a tiny OLED screen. The "LiveDash" allows builders to monitor temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds right on the board. On the way down from Extreme to Apex, we lose half the board's memory slots. Asus says the Rampage VI Apex is targeted at "peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking." To that end, the board only has one memory slot per memory channel, which simplifies the board's wiring and improves signal integrity. That, in turn, should allow overclockers to hit the highest possible memory speeds and the lowest possible latencies. The Apex can take up to four M.2 SSDs, too. If you've got a burning desire for the beauty of the Rampage boards but no desire to burn a hole in your pocketbook, the ROG Strix X299-E is probably where you'll want to look. This model has the features you expect from a ROG X299 mainboard, like dual M.2 sockets, Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet, onboard Wi-Fi, USB 3.1, and diagnostic LEDs. Of course, it also includes RGB LED accents, Aura Sync headers, and a couple of pump control headers. Asus Prime X299-Deluxe Gaming isn't the only reason people build high-end PCs, though. If you need a high-end motherboard with all the trimmings, but you don't want to be saddled with the gamer stigma, the Prime X299-Deluxe has most everything offered by the Rampage VI Extreme above. That includes the LiveDash OLED readout, 802.11ad Wi-Fi, and a pair of M.2 sockets. It also includes a U.2 port for enterprise SSDs, and a pair of Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet connections. The Prime X299-Deluxe doesn't have the Extreme's Thunderbolt connection on-board, so Asus includes a ThunderboltEX 3 card in the box. The X299-Deluxe also includes a "Fan Extension" card that will apparently provide even more fan headers in case the motherboard's standard provisions of five fan headers and two pump headers won't suffice. Neither of those cards are included with the Prime X299-A which also drops the Deluxe's 802.11ad Wi-Fi and LiveDash OLED. Asus TUF X299 Mark 1 Not so long ago Asus' TUF family of motherboards was better known as Sabertooth, but the company seems to have dropped the moniker with its Z270 boards in favor of a military-style "Mark" designation. Along those lines, we're getting two TUF motherboards based on the X299 platform: the TUF X299 Mark 1 and TUF X299 Mark 2. Asus says the TUF boards "meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine." Unfortunately, the company didn't provide a lot of details about the capabilities of these boards, but we can see from the pictures that both include two M.2 sockets and minimal emphasis on glitz. The TUF Mark 1 is covered in metallic "Thermal Armor" both front and back, and it integrates a squirrel cage fan to blow cool air directly over the beheatsink'd M.2 drive below. The TUF X299 Mark 2 is fundamentally very similar to the Mark 1, but it doffs most of the other board's Thermal Armor for a "stripped down" appearance that should suit the tastes of gerbils allergic to flash and style. Asus also remarks that the Mark 2 board should be more economical than its sibling. Unfortunately, we don't know just how economical any of these boards will be, because the company hasn't finalized its pricing. Asus says its X299 motherboards should become available in late June, and that it will announce pricing on June 26. We'll surely be covering these motherboards in more detail and perhaps even reviewing one or more. Stay tuned. Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Drones, bat sensors, VR and more Max Langridge30 May 2017VR Intel Intel will demonstrate using several technologies at the ICC Trophy Drone to analyse pitch data, bat sensor to analyse swing data Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Intel has announced a few new technological additions to the International Cricket Champions (ICC) Trophy, which starts Thursday 1 June. Chief among the technological advancements Intel will be taking to the tournament, include using the company's Falcon 8 drone to analyse the pitch before each match. The Falcon 8 drone is equipped with HD and infrared cameras and will be able to monitor and assess grass cover, grass health and topology. All the data will then be available for commentators to access and use during matches. Intel also has a cricket bat sensor that's powered by the company's own Curie technology. The sensor can be attached to any cricket bat to generate data for each individual player. Data monitored includes back-lift, bat speed and follow-through. The sensors will be used by several batsmen during the tournament to not only allow them to assess and improve their game, but to give the audience a greater insight into stroke play.  Intel It's not just the professionals that will ultimately get to benefit from the Speculur BatSense technology either, as Speculur plans to launch a consumer version of the bat sensor later in 2017. The consumer version will be available in Australia, India, the US and the UK in the second half of 2017. With its applications within sport rising all the time, it may come as no surprise to know that Intel will be bringing virtual reality to the ICC Trophy too. There will be dedicated virtual reality zones at both The Oval and Edgbaston cricket grounds, where fans and visitors can don a VR headset to test their batting skills against a virtual bowler. The bat used when participating will also have the BatSense sensor attached, so players can view their bat stroke data and be given a final simulated score from the session.

And that's not including new motherboards you'll likely need to run them. For that though, you'll more than likely be futureproof for years. The Intel Core X-Series of processors also includes i5 and i7 CPUs, but it is the i9 range that's garnering the most attention. The i9-7980XE, for example, is the first consumer chip from the manufacturer that offers over a teraflop in computing power. Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter Want to play games in 4K 60fps and run other processes over the top? It's a doddle with that chip. The i9 series of chips all run at base clock speeds of 3.3GHz. Turbo Boost can increase that up to 4.5GHz. To keep the chips cool, Intel has developed its own liquid cooling system although if you're willing to shell out so much for the ultimate in processing it is likely you are willing to build your own ultra cooling into your new gaming rig.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 30 May 2017 | MYT 4:43 PM ARM announces new chip design aimed at cracking Intel stronghold A file photo of computer chips on a motherboard inside a communications room at an office in London, UK. ARM's Cortex-A75, whose predecessor is at the heart of many smartphones, will increase performance by 50%, said the UK-based company. — Bloomberg ARM Holdings Plc, the division of SoftBank Group Corp whose technology is the most widely used in the chip industry, announced a new design that targets the personal computer and server markets dominated by Intel Corp.  The new ARM Cortex-A75, whose predecessor is at the heart many of the world’s smartphones, will increase performance by 50%, the Cambridge, UK-based company said. That step up will be crucial to find a place for it in machines that aren’t constrained by battery life and need the ability to move around huge chunks of data quickly.  “Cortex-A75 has the broadest market implications of any premium processor we’ve ever brought to market,” said Rene Haas, president of ARM’s IP Products Group.  ARM’s customers, who use its designs or create their own chips using a more basic level of the company’s technology, have so far failed to make a dent in Intel’s lead in the PC and lucrative server markets. While 50 billion ARM-based chips were shipped in the last four years, the majority sell for tens of dollars or much less. Some of Intel’s Xeon processors cost thousands.  The improvement in the A75 and a new more efficient A-55 design are also aimed at bringing more computing power to a range of devices, ARM said. That’s necessary because the increasing use of artificial intelligence software in everything from cars to television set-top boxes places more strain on the processors at the heart of such devices. Voice recognition, image recognition and other tasks that require instant manipulation of data will need strong local processing.  Future ARM-based designs will also be more flexible, which would allow for a combination of powerful and efficient processors on the same chip. For example, a set-top box that infrequently needs a burst of computing power could be equipped with a chip that has one powerful processor core – an A-75 – and many smaller A-55 types that could perform a number of tasks in parallel.  The new designs will start to show up in devices beginning in 2018, ARM said. Its customers include chip companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and gadget and phone makers including Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Get popular Android games heavily discounted or free Microsoft’s weapon in high-stakes cloud-computing battle with Amazon?

John Rosevear, Keith Speights, and Keith Noonan (TMFMarlowe) May 30, 2017 at 10:33AM What stocks are the "smartest" investors buying? We asked three Fool contributors a version of that question: Which stocks are either already getting attention from highly regarded professional investors or should be? Here's why they think Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH), and an old favorite -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- deserve a close look right now.  An under-the-radar way to invest in self-driving cars John Rosevear (Delphi Automotive): A lot of analysts and pundits will tell you that Silicon Valley companies are the best way to invest in the coming wave of autonomous vehicles. But some smart investors know that there's plenty of cutting-edge work being done within the "legacy" auto industry -- and old-line auto supplier Delphi Automotive increasingly stands out as a company that could profit big as cars and trucks learn to drive themselves.  Look past the tech-press hype and you'll find Delphi Automotive in the forefront of commercializing self-driving technology. Image source: Delphi Automotive. Delphi is deeply involved in a number of ventures that aim to bring self-driving technology to market in the next few years. Those include a partnership with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) that will make a "Level 4" self-driving system available to any automaker -- old or new -- by the end of 2019. (Learn about the "levels" of self-driving technology here.)  Delphi is also working with those two partners to help BMW AG (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) create a series of self-driving systems -- and Delphi and its partners will have the right to sell those to other automakers as well. Delphi is also believed to be working with several other automakers and tech companies on projects to develop or integrate autonomous technology.  How big does it expect those businesses to be? Let's put it this way: Delphi recently announced that it will soon spin off its legacy internal combustion engine components business to focus on "electronic safety systems" -- specifically, self-driving technology. It's realigning its whole business around this future technology, and it's doing so from a strong position. Delphi's status as a long-established industry supplier means that the automakers will know that its self-driving offerings will perform as advertised. That's not necessarily true of new high-tech entrants.  Intel's pending purchase of Mobileye means that there's no longer a pure play for those who want to invest in autonomous vehicle technology, at least among public companies. But Delphi is becoming the next best thing. At 20 times earnings, it's not cheap for an old auto industry supplier -- but investors who buy today might look very smart indeed in a few years.  A smart personalized medicine play Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Investors who bought shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals early this year are probably feeling really smart right now. The biotech stock is up more than 60% so far in 2017. The main reason behind Vertex's big surge this year was the company's announcement in March of results from two late-stage clinical studies of a combination of tezacaftor and Kalydeco in treating cystic fibrosis (CF). Those results were so promising that Vertex intends to submit the combo therapy for regulatory approval in the U.S. and in Europe in the third quarter of 2017.  Vertex also received more good news for Kalydeco. On May 18, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for use in CF patients ages two and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This was the fourth FDA approval for the drug, which first gained approval for treating CF patients ages six and older with the specific G551D mutation in the CFTR gene.  In the meantime, Vertex is continuing to finalize reimbursement deals in European countries for another CF drug, Orkambi. Although Orkambi is the company's newest drug on the market, it has already leaped past Kalydeco to become Vertex's top-selling product. Based on the strength of Kalydeco and Orkambi, along with good prospects for approval of the tezacaftor/Kalydeco combo, Vertex is one of the top biotechs developing personalized medicines and appears to be poised for tremendous earnings growth. I think buying Vertex is still a smart move even after the stock's big run-up. Buffett takes another bite of Apple Keith Noonan (Apple): No investor has cultivated a more esteemed reputation than Warren Buffett, so news that he and his company Berkshire Hathaway have been buying up shares of Apple has understandably attracted a lot of attention. Berkshire now owns roughly 2.5% of outstanding Apple shares, and the company has been increasing its position in the tech giant at a time when there's considerable debate about the iPhone maker's valuation. Buffett has added to his company's stake in Apple even as shares traded at record highs, making it his company's third-largest holding despite a previously stated aversion to tech investing. The Oracle of Omaha has praised Cupertino's long-term earnings growth potential and also pointed to the company's recent move to increase its share buyback authorization by $35 billion as a favorable sign. The Apple Watch. Image source: Apple, Inc. While iPhone sales are showing signs of softening, Apple is seeing strong performance from its services business and has some exciting projects on the horizon including its long-in-development push into smart cars. Also encouraging for Apple investors is momentum in wearables. While the Apple Watch got off to a bit of a rough start, it looks like consumers are becoming more receptive to the company's smartwatch offerings. Sales data from Strategy Analytics for the first quarter of 2017 shows that the company is now the top wearables company by market share, with shipments of its smartwatch increasing 59% year over year to reach 3.5 million units. With its brand and business strengths, stellar cash flow, and a forward P/E of 17 that still notches below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 18, it's not hard to see why Buffett keeps coming back to Apple.

(AMD) Stock on Any Good-Sized Dip The company Advanced Micro Devices is today isn't the company it was even just a year ago. AMD stock is just overbought. May 30, 2017, 9:04 am EDT  |  By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer Source: Shutterstock     View All   The past two weeks have been miserable for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders. AMD stock has fallen nearly 14% since its analyst day meeting on May 16, when the company didn’t confirm rumors that it and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) weren’t teaming up. Source: Nvidia Intel’s GPU contract with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expired in March, and the company was supposed to be shopping around. Fanning the bearish flames since then was a downgrade of AMD stock from Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees. She lowered her stance on the company from a “Buy” to a “Hold” on concerns that Advanced Micro Devices’ business model isn’t going to work well enough in the long run. Van Hees doubts AMD and Intel will ever come to an accord, simply because Intel doesn’t need to make a deal. Several other analysts expressed similar concerns shortly after the analyst day event. It begs the question: Was the market wrong to push AMD stock up more than 400% between March 2016 and March 2017 on hopes that a true turnaround was underway? Or does Advanced Micro Devices have enough in its pipeline to justify the huge rally? The New and Improved AMD No suspense or teasing is required here — Advanced Micro Devices is the real deal, and has positioned itself for massive growth that simply wasn’t possible as recently as a year ago. Just don’t conflate the company with the stock. As yours truly pointed out in April, there was and still is a disconnect between AMD stock and AMD’s plausible near-term future. In other words, the stock’s price got too far ahead of its near-term prospects. It happens. Counted among the bullish factors is the development of a central processing unit (or CPU) called the Ryzen. It’s built to compete with Intel’s Core iX series at about half the price, and it achieves its goal. While the initial reviews of Ryzen processors were a bit wobbly, the reason for their subpar performance underscores the underlying problem: Video game designers didn’t develop many of their recent publications to be played on the new CPU architecture. Now with AMD’s developer tools in hand and good reason to create patches that utilize the Ryzen’s eight cores and 16 threads, gaming on the processor will improve as patches and updates are released. Another weapon in Advanced Micro Devices’ arsenal is its yet-to-be-released Vega graphics processing unit, which takes aim at Nvidia’s growth within the GPU space. Vega’s architecture allows for the offloading of the graphical processing from the video card to the motherboard’s memory, which is generally more powerful than a video card itself. Yet, AMD’s GPUs are powerful in their own right. They’re so fast that when several of them are used in parallel, they’re fast enough and accurate enough to serve as the computing power needed in artificial intelligence applications. Its Radeon line of graphics processing units have already been tweaked for this purpose, effectively throwing its hat in a ring largely controlled by Nvidia. There’s still more on the company’s R&D plate to unveil, then launch. It’s interesting simply because it’s all new. While Advanced Micro Devices has remained in business, it has been far more focused on development than production for the past several years. The fruit of that labor is just now starting to ripen, and these fruits are considerably more competitive than its previous fruit has been. This isn’t the AMD of three years ago, or even one year ago. Bottom Line for AMD Stock Still, Advanced Micro shares look and feel overextended. That’s because they are.

Unveiled at Computex 2017 this week, the new chips are part of what Intel says is recognition that no, not all PC users are created equal. Indeed, when it comes to gamers, content creators, and people dealing in compute-intense segments like virtual reality, the needs are higher than the current Core i3, i5, and i7 range can deliver. The new Core i9 gamely steps into that open space. Billed as offering the highest performance for those doing “advanced gaming, VR and content creation” it’s the first consumer desktop CPU that packs – in Core i9 Extreme Edition form – a full 18 cores and 36 threads. “This is by far the most extreme desktop processor ever introduced,” Intel boasts. It sits in a new range of Core X-series chips targeting enthusiasts. Not all will be quite so over-specified, mind. They’ll start out at four cores, with Intel promising more affordable options than what will undoubtedly be a premium price tag for the Core i9 Extreme Edition. Then there’ll be 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 core options, all using the new LGA 2066 socket. New too is the Intel X299 chipset to go with the Core X-series. Improving the I/O capabilities over Intel’s old version, it’ll have 30 total high-speed I/O lanes and up to three Intel Rapid Storage Technology PCIe 3.0 x4 storage support. Intel Ethernet Connection 219 is also supported, together with up to eight SATA 3.0 6 Gb/s ports, up to 10 USB 3.0 ports, and up to three independent displays. It can handle DDR4 memory, Intel Optane memory, overclocking, and has Intel Platform Trust Technology 3.0. Updates to Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, meanwhile, now allow the system to spot which are the two top performing cores, and then target them with the most critical workloads. That, Intel promises, should deliver a sizable jump in both single- and multithreaded performance. The upshot is more than just on-paper boasting, though. For video editing, Intel suggests, it opens the door to even faster image and video rendering and encoding, and real-time previews of even the most complex projects. Gamers will be able to configure rigs with up to four discrete graphics cards, with 12K video and both maxed-out settings on their games of choice while also streaming and recording in the background. The first systems running the X299 chipset will be available in the coming weeks, along with motherboards using the chipset and the LGA 2066 socket.

It also announced the technologies that it will be bringing including advanced pitch analysis by an Intel drone, profiling the bat swing using a bat sensor powered by an Intel Curie module, and bringing a cricket VR experience to the fans at the stadiums. According to the company these technologies will be showcased at the ICC Champions Trophy which will be kicking of from 1 June in UK. “We couldn’t be more excited to have Intel as our Official Innovation Partner of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort,” said David Richardson, CEO of the ICC. Sandra Lopez, Intel Sports Group Vice President also mentioned the importance of technology in transforming the way we play and view sports. “Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitization and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports,” Lopez added.

No word on price, battery life. Mark Walton (UK) - May 30, 2017 1:34 pm UTC Enlarge Nvidia reader comments 103 Share this story In a thinly veiled branding exercise, graphics card maker Nvidia has unveiled "Max-Q," a series of thin and light gaming notebooks. Much like Intel's Ultrabook initiative, Nvidia is hoping that Max-Q will encourage laptop makers to create gaming laptops that can actually be used on the go, rather than remain permanently tethered to a wall socket, because humanity's best scientists haven't yet created a battery-sized fusion power cell. To that end, Max-Q (a co-opted NASA term that defines the point at which the aerodynamic stress on a rocket in atmospheric flight is maximised) has some recommended physical specs. Those include a thickness of 18mm and a weight of 2.3kg—a significant reduction over the 51mm and 4.5kg of GTX 880M-era laptops. Naturally, Max-Q laptops sport one of Nvidia's desktop-class graphics cards, which include the GTX 1060, GTX 1070, and GTX 1080. Further ReadingAcer Predator 21X: The world’s first curved-screen laptop Fan noise, a perpetual problem for gaming laptops, is kept low by a new feature dubbed WhisperMode. WhisperMode dynamically changes the game's frame rate, while simultaneously tweaking the graphics settings in order to save GPU resources. While Nvidia is yet to reveal the technical details behind WhisperMode, it sounds an awful lot like AMD's Radeon Chill feature, which lowers the frame rate during less action-orientated scenes in order to save power. What isn't part of Max-Q are battery life recommendations. Gaming laptops are notorious for having terrible battery life. While more efficient CPUs and GPUs have helped increase battery life over the past few years, slim Max-Q designs leave even less room for a battery. Perhaps the oddest part of Nvidia's Max-Q announcement were comparisons to games consoles. While running a live demo of Project Cars 2, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed that a GTX 1080 Asus laptop is 60 percent faster than a PlayStation 4 Pro. While the performance is certainly better, Huang failed to mention the price of the Max-Q laptop. Currently, a GTX 1080 laptop costs at least £2,000; a PS4 Pro costs a mere £335.

YouTube/Apple Apple has conspicuously changed the delivery schedule for the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 for US customers. The Cupertino company has pushed the delivery date for buyers of the 2016 model with the fastest delivery option set for June 5 and the free delivery option on June 6 at the earliest. Apple has been known to alter the delivery dates, though most have somehow associated it with the potential release of upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 models. As mentioned in a previous post, the Cupertino company may introduce upgraded models of the variant which would be armed with an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, Mac Rumors reports. It is possible that Apple may be trying to control stocks and opt to produce 2016 MacBook Pro models in safer volumes. That version drew its share of criticism, mostly hitting on Apple’s decision to use an Intel Skylake chipset. As most know, Apple was backed into a wall before eventually deciding to release the MacBook Pro refresh. Availability of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset was unstable last year before eventually normalizing in early 2017. The reason behind the release of the MacBook Pro 2016 was seen as a way for Apple to maintain its regular schedule of releasing new models for its laptop line. But now, it seems the Cupertino company will break that anyway with a suggested revelation of upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 models at WWDC 2017. Another point worth noting is that it is only the 15-inch model that got a pushed back delivery date. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is in stock and can be delivered as early as the next day. It remains to be seen if there will be an upgraded 13-inch MacBook Pro models, something that could be announced at the upcoming Apple event. In other regions, it seems that 15-inch MacBook Pro delivery estimates have also hit a snag. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and several other countries are reportedly experiencing long waits, hinting that Apple may have other plans ahead. The Cupertino company may have toned down production, as they expect demand for the anticipated MacBook Pro 2017 to run like crazy if it is introduced at the WWDC 2017. Apple normally allows 320 days before a new model is released. If a MacBook Pro 2017 does come out on June 5, the 2016 model would be below that average with only 220 days passed.

It’s the fourth time in a row that the company has stuck to this process for its new lineup of chips. The company didn’t really say then what the improvements were going to be but it did claim a 15 percent performance improvement over the existing 7th Generation of Core processors. Intel now says that the performance gain is actually going to be 30 percent. Intel confirmed at Computex 2017 that the performance improvement that it talked about previously doesn’t show the full picture. It says that the upcoming 8th Generation Core processors will actually provide 30 percent improved performance compared to the 7th Generation Core processors. It merits mentioning here that Intel has based this figure off of the Sysmark benchmark, but it goes to show that we can expect more from the company’s next-generation processors. The company didn’t really say more about the 8th Generation processors during its keynote at Computex 2017. There’s no change in the fact that they’re based on the 14 nanometer architecture and that Intel is going to release them at some point later this year. Intel has launched its new Core X family of processors today, based on the Skylake architecture, the new family even comes with top-of-the-line Core i9 models for those who want more performance.

The new chips are mostly based on an updated version of Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake platform, called Skylake X, with the exception of a pair of entry-level four-core models that are based on the Kaby Lake X platform. Billed as Intel’s most scalable, accessible and powerful desktop platform ever, the lineup includes a new Core i9 processor brand along with a Core i9 Extreme Edition processor—the first consumer desktop chip with a whopping 18 cores and 36 threads of power. Intel’s Turbo Boost technology has been updated with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology as well. According to Intel, the new Core X family sports ten percent faster multithread performance over the previous generation, and a 15 percent boost in single thread performance. The entry-level Core X i5-7640X chip with four cores and as many threads starts at $242. The more powerful Core i7 X-Series starts at $339 for a four-core, eight-thread model and goes all the way up to a $599 eight-core, 16-thread chip. The flagship Core i9 X-Series chip, which stars at ten processor cores and 16 threads, is priced at $999, with its 16-core, 32-thread variant going for $1,699. The new desktop Core X chips are designed to work with Intel’s new X299 motherboard chipset which should be rolling out on partner products in the coming weeks, along with the new CPUs. As you know, Apple is expected to update its iMac all-in-ones with server-grade Intel Xeon processors and discreet graphics later this year. The chip giant says its upcoming eighth-generation Coffe Lake platform will see up to a thirty percent performance improvement over the current seventh-generation Kaby Lake. It did not provide a timeframe for Coffe Lake chips. “We will have more to say about the eightht-generaiton Core processor in the future,” said Intel. The Coffe Lake chips may power updated MacBook Pros, coming later this year.

Name: Subject: Message: What ever happened to LG’s NUCLUN processors? Featuresby Gary Sims6 days ago 4 600 11   Towards the end of 2014 LG announced its first mobile System-on-a-Chip (SoC), the octa-core NUCLUN. The chip debuted in the LG G3 Screen, a smartphone developed specifically for the Korean market, but since then it hasn’t been used in any smartphones. At the time of its release LG was quite buoyant about the benefits of building its own SoC. “NUCLUN opens up a new chapter in LG’s history of innovation in the mobile industry,” said Dr. Jong-seok Park, head of LG Mobile. “With this in-house solution, we will be able to achieve better vertical integration and further diversity our product strategy against stronger competition. NUCLUN will give us greater flexibility in our mobile strategy going forward.” So what happened? The NUCLUN (pronounced NOO-klun) was designed using ARM’s big.LITTLE technology with four 1.5GHz Cortex-A15 cores and four 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 cores. The chip also included a CAT 6 4G modem and an PowerVR GPU from Imagination. For 2014, that was a reasonable setup, however not a flagship setup as the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 had a similar SoC configuration. A year later towards the end of 2015 rumors started to circulate that LG was working on its second generation NUCLUN SoC. Dubbed the NUCLUN 2 it was suggested that the new chip would keep its octa-core heritage, however it would make the jump from 32-bit to 64-bit by using four ARM Cortex-A72 cores and four Cortex-A53 CPU cores. It was also suggested that LG Electronics was working with Intel Foundry to build the new chip on a 14nm FinFET manufacturing process and simultaneously working with TSMC on a 16nm version. Either of which would be a notable improvement over the 28nm process used for the first chip. By the end of 2015 the rumors had reached full speed and it was thought that the NUCLUN 2 would be used in the LG V20. However, nine months later the V20 was launched with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. But just before the launch of the V20, ARM and Intel Custom Foundry announced an agreement to accelerate the development and implementation of ARM SoCs on Intel’s 10nm manufacturing process. As part of that announcement ARM said that the initial agreement covers the manufacture of  “two future advanced ARM Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either ARM big.LITTLE™ or stand-alone configurations.” The key to understanding the above statement is that it tells us about two yet unreleased (i.e. future) Cortex-A cores that will be built on 10nm. Why two? Because processors in a big.LITTLE configuration need use the exactly the same ARM architecture revision. The only reason to release two new Cortex-A designs simultaneously is when a new architecture revision is being used. At the time of the announcement I said, “In a nutshell, ARM’s current 64 bit CPUs use the ARM v8 architecture. However there are revisions known as v8.1 and v8.2. big.LITTLE needs the CPU cores to use the same architecture revision. The sentence above hints that ARM will release a new big CPU and a new LITTLE CPU at the same time on 10nm using, I guess, the latest architecture revision.” Now that the ARM Cortex-A75 and the ARM Cortex-A55 have been launched we can see that my prediction was correct. But what of LG? In the same announcement Intel also said that LG will produce “a world-class mobile platform based on Intel Custom Foundry’s 10nm design platform.” Since the only core designs being built by Intel on 10nm are the Cortex-A75 and the Cortex-A55 then it follows that LG’s next SoC will use these new ARM cores. Why the LG G6 didn’t use the Snapdragon 835 LG doesn’t exclusively use Qualcomm’s chips. Quite a number of its mid-range device use MediaTek processors including the LG Stylo 3. However for the high-end LG needs Qualcomm’s offerings, mainly because it has no alternative. In fact it can be argued that a lack of alternatives to Qualcomm is hurting the ecosystem. If you look at the other major handset makers you will see that they all make their own mobile processors. Samsung has its Exynos range, while Huawei has its Kirin line. Everyone else has to use either Qualcomm or MediaTek. The LG G6  didn’t ship with the Snapdragon 835 but instead with the 2016 Snapdragon 821. Many people found this surprising as it was assumed that all the flagships devices using a Qualcomm processor would use the 835. However you need to take into account the timing of the G6’s launch. Although the first 835 chips were available by time the LG6 hit the shelves, it takes months to ramp up production of these premium handsets, which meant that LG needed the processor parts before the Snapdragon 835 was available in quantity. Since meaningful volume production of the Snapdragon 835 was not available to LG before the planned launch of the G6 then LG either had to go with the Snapdragon 821 or delay the launch of the G6 for two, three, maybe even four months. However it is now assumed that since the Snapdragon 835 is in full production that it will be used in in the LG V30, or whatever LG calls its mid-season V20 successor. Such a reliance on Qualcomm could be seen as a problem for LG, especially since this isn’t the first time that LG had to opt for a different processor due to problems with Qualcomm’s leading offering. Remember how LG cleverly avoided the whole Snapdragon 810 overheating drama by opting for the 808 in the LG G4? The solution for LG is to make its own processor (again), just like Huawei and Samsung. Naming and timing So, we know that LG is making a Cortex-A75 / Cortex-A55 based processor using Intel’s 10nm process. There are no current clues about the GPU, however it makes sense for LG to go with the ARM Mali-G72, since it was also announced at the same time as the two new processor cores. In fact, it is easiest for LG to use as many ARM designs as it can in its new processor as ARM can provide a complete SoC solution (CPU, GPU, Video processor, Display processor, Image Signal Processor, etc), along with all the system integration services. It seems that the NUCLUN 2 did actually make it to silicon, however it was never used in any devices, remember that it is now 2.5 years since the NUCLUN 1 appeared. So it is likely that the new LG SoC will be either called the NUCLUN 3 or LG will adopt a new naming scheme, probably still based on the NUCLUN brand but with a more complex structure, something like the NUCLUN 300, or whatever. But why didn’t the NUCLUN 2 ever see the light of day? One possible answer is because LG may have received tax breaks or tax incentives to build a processor research lab from the Korean government, and as such it needed to actually make something, but not necessarily ship any products using the designs that came from the lab. LG has received help from the Korean government before, most notably with its OLED business. It is interesting to note that the original NUCLUN only appeared in one device, one developed specifically for the Korean market and not sold anywhere else! However such tax breaks are, at the moment, just a speculation, but if true it seems that any new NUCLUN processors would certainly justify the costs, especially if it ends up in a popular handset or two. There remains however one big problem for LG, and that is Intel’s 10nm process. At the time of writing Intel has not shipped any 10nm chips, not even for itself, let alone for any of its Foundry clients. The current rumor mill suggests that we won’t see any PC type end-products shipping with Intel based 10nm chips until the end of this year (2017) and some people are suggesting that this could slip into 2018. That means that if Intel are putting the demands of its customers like LG on a equal footing with its own internal demands (and it probably isn’t doing that) then LG’s mobile processor won’t be available until the end of 2017. That means that LG might not get development samples in time for the LG G7. If Qualcomm isn’t able to supply LG with its next generation of Snapdragon processor in a time frame that meets LG’s development cycle, then the G7 might use the Snapdragon 835, in a similar way to how the G6 used the Snapdragon 821. However there would be hope for the LG V40. But there are reports that LG and Qualcomm are already working together to make sure that the rumored Snapdragon 845 will be available for the G7. This means that if all this supposition is correct then the V30 will use the Snapdragon 835, the G7 will use the Qualcomm SoC that comes after the Snapdragon  835 (the Snapdragon  845?), and the LG V40 will use the new Intel made NUCLUN. Wrap-up One aspect that I haven’t touched on is the LTE modem for the new NUCLUN. Whose LTE modem will LG incorporate in to the new processor? Qualcomm’s? Intel’s? Probably the latter and it was likely part of the deal between LG and Intel. What do you think? Is this just pie-in-the-sky thinking or do the clues point to LG moving away from Qualcomm for its flagship devices?

Called GeForce GTX Max-Q, NVIDIA is undertaking their own Ultrabook project of sorts, encouraging partners to develop thinner and lighter high performance gaming laptops, giving them better tools to do so, and then bundling it under a catchy name. The end result is that, not unlike Intel’s efforts in this space, NVIDIA wants to sell consumers on the idea that they can have their cake and eat it too with a light laptop that is still substantially more powerful than their old laptop. As a bit of historical context to this, last year NVIDIA shook up their high-end laptop branding a bit by doing away with “Mobile” video card designations. Rather than having a GeForce GTX 1080M for example, the company simply offered a laptop version of the desktop GTX 1080. Or rather, that was the basic idea behind the policy. In practice these mobile-but-not SKUs had their own specs (e.g. a GTX 1070 with an additional SM enabled), not to mention the greater thermal constraints of a laptop, and of course the use of laptop-appropriate MXM boards. Consequently from a product designation standpoint, this is a bit of a return to form for NVIDIA. They never stopped making mobile parts – and I haven’t seen any evidence that partners couldn’t try for a thin laptop before now – but now at least some of their mobile parts have a mobile designation, just that the ‘M’ stands for Max-Q instead of Mobile. Which admittedly may be a bit of a cynical read on the situation, but as there’s only a very limited amount of new tech involved – and no new GPUs – Max-Q seems to be more about branding and setting performance expectations for high efficiency (as opposed to high performance) parts. On which note, this isn’t the first place we’ve seen the name Max-Q show up, either. So I wouldn’t be too surprised if we see NVIDIA use it in more places. In any case, as part of the Max-Q initiative, NVIDIA is releasing Max-Q designs for the GTX 1080, GTX 1070, and the GTX 1060. Not explicitly stated by NVIDIA, but something I suspect, is that these designs are using new MXM cards and aren’t just a different clockspeed profile for the original cards. But at any rate, these are still the same SM and memory configurations as the original mobile parts, but now with lower TDPs and lower clockspeeds to match. NVIDIA GeForce 10 Series Laptop Max-Q Specifications   GTX 1080 GTX 1070 GTX 1060 CUDA Cores 2560 2048 1280 Core Clock 1101 - 1290MHz 1101 - 1215MHz 1063 - 1265MHz Boost Clock 1278 - 1468MHz 1265 - 1379MHz 1341 - 1480MHz Memory Clock 10Gbps GDDR5X 8Gbps GDDR5 8Gbps GDDR5 Memory Bus Width 256-bit 256-bit 192-bit VRAM 8GB 8GB 3GB/6GB Max-Q TDP 90 - 110W 80 - 90W 60 - 70W Full Perf TDP 150W 115W 80W GPU GP104 GP104 GP106 Manufacturing Process TSMC 16nm TSMC 16nm TSMC 16nm In a specification document NVIDIA released to the press, they listed both the normal and Max-Q TDPs and clockspeeds of their mobile products. I do feel this is a bit disingenuous, as mobile parts are commonly subject to thermal throttling – and few laptops could sustain the 115W+ TDPs of the original GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 – so comparing Max-Q to the desktop-like TDPs of the original parts doesn’t tell the whole story. But in any case, the point NVIDIA was looking to drive how is that while official clockspeeds have dropped by a few hundred MHz compared to the original parts (a not insignificant drop), TDPs have dropped by even more. A GTX 1080 Max-Q that tops out at 110W may only have a boost clock of 1468MHz (a drop of about 15%), but the TDP has dropped by 40W. Which ultimately is the principle purpose of the Max-Q branding from the NVIDIA side of matters: these are slower parts at the more energy-optimal point in the curve, instead of going further up the curve in the name of performance. Clockspeeds aside, there are some hardware changes to mention. In discussing the Max-Q design, NVIDIA noted that they have implemented some changes over the years to reach this point. A big part of this is of course Pascal, which gives them a solid starting point for high efficiency performance. But the company has also cited improvements in voltage regulators as part of the Max-Q formula, apparently using very low loss regulators optimized for around 1 Volt(a). And this is where things get a bit fuzzy, since NVIDIA was similarly promoting power delivery improvements for their desktop GTX 1080 reference boards last year; so I’m not sure if there’s anything new here specifically for Max-Q, or if it’s just about how NVIDIA has put the pieces together for boards going into Max-Q laptops. The final piece of the puzzle then is what NVIDIA is calling “advanced thermal solutions”, which the company doesn’t go into much detail on, but notes that it’s responsible for allowing their partners to cool such powerful cards effectively, and to do so without blowing out any eardrums while blowing out hot air. Taken altogether, I’m not sure what here is new. NVIDIA always talks up their latest wares – they’re trying to sell GPUs, after all – but there’s an implication that NVIDIA and their partners weren’t already using high efficiency regulators and good coolers on past products, which of course isn’t the case. The company has been making high-efficiency laptop GPUs for the 100W mark for a while now, and these designs have been powerful in their own right thanks to a combination of solid design and chip binning. So there’s a very fuzzy line here in terms of what’s actually new in terms of video card design, and how much of this is NVIDIA talking up what’s essentially the successor to the GTX 980M (i.e. low voltage parts). WhisperMode Meanwhile, buried in NVIDIA’s announcement is a new feature for GeForce Experience, which they are calling WhisperMode. As noted in NVIDIA’s press release “WhisperMode intelligently paces the game's frame rate while simultaneously configuring the graphics settings for optimal power efficiency.” This description sounds almost identical to AMD’s Radeon Chill, in which case we should have a good idea of what to expect: framerate throttling combined with GeForce Experience/Battery Boost settings adjustment to turn down the image quality, lowering the overall rendering needs. What isn’t clear is whether NVIDIA is also duplicating AMD’s efforts to time frame rendering such that frames are submitted as late as possible to minimize input lag. In any case, while WhisperMode is being announced as part of Max-Q, it’s actually part of GeForce Experience. So once released, it will be available to all Pascal laptops – including existing laptops – and not just Max-Q laptops. Max-Q Design Laptops Coming June 27th Last, but certainly not least of course is the end product of all of this: the Max-Q laptops. The goal of NVIDIA’s initiative is to get their partners out promoting thin laptops with high performance GeForce video cards, and their partners have quickly jumped into action. NVIDIA has not publicly announced a definition for what a Max-Q laptop should be, but there is a very common thread among all of the laptops they’ve detailed so far: under 5lbs and under 20mm thick. The marquee laptop for the program appears to be Asus’s new UX501 “Zephyrus” laptop, which NVIDIA showed off at their press conference. This is a 15.6” laptop with an Intel Core i7 quad and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080. NVIDIA has also named laptops from Clevo and MSI, which come with the GTX 1070 and have a similar build. In which case at least among the laptops NVIDIA has shown off so far, 15-inches seems like the sweet spot for this program. Graphs Corrected To Use 0.0 Origin NVIDIA is promoting these laptops as having significantly better performance than existing thin laptops – in this case comparing it to an 18mm thick GTX 1060 laptop – though this seems to be more about the GPU used than the thickness of the laptop. The big question of course is just what performance such a thin laptop can sustain; even at the lower-bounds of the GTX 1080 Max-Q configuration, that’s still 90W for the GPU, along with another 35W for an Intel quad-core CPU in a cTDP down state. To NVIDIA’s credit, they definitely know a thing or two about cooling (see: reference blower), so applying that knowledge to laptops could be a boon. But sub-20mm still leaves limited room for heatsinks and fans. Anyhow, expect to see Max-Q design laptops show up later next month, on June 27th. Along with the partner designs NVIDIA is explicitly showing off at Computex this week, they have lined up many of the major OEMs for this initiative. And particularly with Clevo participating, this means their reference designs will be able to filter down to a number of smaller vendors who sell Clevo’s designs.

POST A COMMENT 13 Comments View All Comments ZeDestructor - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link As someone with a penchant for high-performance laptops: Can we keep the big, thick designs with overkill cooling for suboptimal ambient situations please? Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link I'd be shocked if they go away just because you can cram more cooling into a thicker package and despite whatever improvements NVidia may have on offer I suspect the 1080 model's either going to be a lot louder or more heavily throttled in a 20mm chassis than in a 40mm one. At the same time, as someone who wants something that doesn't look like a brick and only get a few hours of on battery runtime when web surfing; I hope that this initiative does get thinner laptops with midrange GPUs into mainstreamish products instead of just pricy halo items like the XPS15 and Razer Blade. Reply Samus - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link I can't wait for those monstrosities to die. A 10lb laptop with 30 minutes of battery life is about as practical as a mini ITX computer with a carrying handle that cost 1/3rd the price. Reply extide - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Don't forget this is putting the same parts (~100w GPU + ~35w CPU) into a much smaller chassis with much less room for battery, so compared to a thicker/bigger laptop with, again, literally the same parts, these will get less battery life. There is nothing magic about the thickness of the chassis that makes ultrabooks last longer, it's the slower much lower TDP parts typically found in them (~35w GPU + 15W CPU). Reply extide - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link ...and many ultrabooks don't even have a dGPU, in which case you are comparing a ~135w laptop to a 15w one, that's almost a difference of 10x! Reply ZeDestructor - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link That's fine by me. I don't have a thick, 5kg laptop to use on the go, I have a thick, 5kg laptop so I can drop it onto a desk at my destination, plug a 2kg brick into the wall and then do things at full blast for hours. Note: I also have a lovely thin lightweight laptop for more laptopy things. And before the mini-ITX cabal shows up: mini-ITX requires me to also carry around a keyboard, mouse, screen, and power strip, or have one at the destination. In comparison, a 5kg, 40mm thick laptop is one hell of a lot more portable. Reply zepi - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link OEM's have decided that you can have any thickness as long as it is less than 20mm and deliver requires yearly happiness reviews which only have "like" and 5/5 rating buttons. Reply drajitshnew - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Very true, I don't know what is the status in US but in India HQ series are hard to find and when you do find one, it has a disproportionate price increase, and even then it gets a stepmotherly treatment from the manufacturer -- at least that is the case with lenovo. Reply Freakie - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Desktop Replacements are still a thing, you shouldn't worry. Reply Ej24 - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Seeing as there's a single slot desktop 1070 that's only about 20mm thick, I can definitely see this being doable with a lower tdp binned gpu. This is good news. I'm getting tired of anemic igpu in ultrabooks. If you're lucky you can find an ultrabook with a crappy old 940m which is an utter joke. This is a step in the right direction.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 30, 2017 at 8:30AM On May 30, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its new Skylake-X family of processors aimed at the high-end desktop market. Intel is pitching this family of processors (as well as the accompanying X299 platform) at gamers, content creators, and overclocking enthusiasts. The high-end desktop market is a relatively small one, but it's a market that's growing and a market in which customers are generally willing to pay premiums in exchange for higher performance (something that translates into relatively rich average selling prices). Image source: Intel. Let's go over the key announcements vis-a-vis the Skylake-X processors and what it all could ultimately mean for Intel's business. More cores, much better value Intel's previous high-end desktop processors, known as Broadwell-E, came in six, eight, and 10 core options. The 10-core part ran at modest speeds out of the box (3GHz base frequency/3.5GHz maximum turbo frequency) and cost customers about $1,700. The eight-core part below it sold for about $1,100, with the two six core parts (differentiated by PCI Express lanes and frequency) listed for about $617 and $441, respectively. With Skylake-X, Intel has built much higher-performance and much better value parts across the board. The very top model -- the Core i9-7980XE -- packs 18 cores and carries a $1,999 price tag. Below that is the 16-core Core i9-7960X for $1,699, the 14-core Core i9-7940X for $1,399, the 12-core Core i9-7920X for $1,199, the 10-core Core i9-7900X for $999, the eight-core Core i7-7820X for $599, and the six-core Core i7-7800X for $389. Although Intel has yet to disclose the frequencies of the Core i9-7920X and up (Intel is likely still in the process of finalizing these SKUs), the frequencies of the Core i9-7900X and below have been disclosed and are up nicely from their Broadwell-E counterparts. For example, the 10-core Core i9-7900X runs at a base frequency of 3.3GHz and a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 frequency of 4.3GHz. The 10-core Core i7-6950X runs at a base frequency of just 3GHz and only offers a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 3.5GHz. To top it all off, the Skylake-X parts use an updated processor architecture that should yield performance improvements relative to the Broadwell-E parts at identical core counts and frequencies. The 7900X is also much cheaper than the 6950X, making the former a substantially better value than the latter was. Intel finally takes high-end desktop seriously With the Skylake-X family of processors, Intel has seemingly built "no-compromise" parts. These parts scale to ridiculously high core counts, pricing is far more rational (there are no irrational jumps in pricing between different models in the lineup, either), and the chips also run at very high frequencies when fewer cores are loaded up (this is important for gaming).  In other words, these chips should do very well at content creation (and other tasks that can take advantage of multiple cores) while at the same time delivering strong out-of-the-box performance for gaming applications, which generally can't make good use of many processor cores today. I expect that the new Skylake-X lineup will reinvigorate enthusiasm in the gaming/PC enthusiast community for Intel's high-end desktop processors and platform after the company had seemingly neglected it for years in favor of its cheaper mainstream desktop platform.  If I'm right, this should translate into both an acceleration in unit shipment growth and a richer product mix within the company's desktop processor shipments. Now, enthusiast/gaming-related chips make up a relatively small portion of overall desktop computer market, but these chips are high value and shipments of them seem to be growing as the overall desktop personal computer market declines. This suggests that, over time, enthusiast/gaming-related chips will become increasingly important revenue and profit drivers for Intel's Client Computing Group, its largest business unit.

Video Acer's Nitro 5 brings fan control to casual gamers Intel is making good on a CES promise to launch a computer that’s small enough to fit inside your wallet or purse. At Computex in Taipei on Tuesday, it showed off the first systems that will support its Compute Card—an ambitious attempt to popularize modular PCs. The card will begin shipping in August, but Intel hasn’t yet announced pricing. Most of the first wave of hardware will come from contract PC makers, but Intel said three big brand names are also working on devices: Dell, HP and Lenovo. The devices could range from laptop-like machines to tablets, displays and even digital whiteboards. Each will have a slot for Compute Card, and users will be able to plug the card into each device to use it. The Compute Card is a little bigger than a credit card and several times thicker at 95mm x 55mm x 5mm (that’s 3.7 inches x 2.2 inches x 0.2 inches). Intel Intel’s Compute Card alongside a credit card. Despite its small size, there’s enough space to fit one of four Intel processors, from a Celeron up to a Core i5. The card also contains 4GB of DDR3 memory, flash storage (from 64GB of eMMC to a 128GB SSD); and WiFi and Bluetooth. The four initial models look like this: Intel Intel Compute Card configurations. On stage at Computex, the only traditional computer Intel demonstrated was a touch-enabled all-in-one PC from LG Display. It had a slot for a Compute Card in the side and was easily portable with a carrying handle built right into the top of the case. Martyn Williams/IDG Intel’s Craig Raymond holds up a Compute Card enabled all-in-one from LG Display during a keynote at Computex in Taipei. Intel also showed a prototype laptop for students that’s powered by a Compute Card. The company envisions a student removing the card from the laptop, and popping it into a classroom whiteboard (Intel had a non-working prototype on display). Then, after school, the student could take the card and insert it into a desktop dock at home. The Compute Card architecture allows for easy upgrading, with more powerful cards replacing older models, allowing users to keep their systems fast and up-to-date. This isn’t the first time the PC industry has tried to popularize a portable computing unit that can plug into dumb terminals, but it’s the smallest and most compact attempt yet.

PC enthusiasts and digital content creators are just as demanding. To address the needs of this group of PC users, Intel has introduced a new line of processors designated as the Core X-series at the tech trade show Computex 2017 in Taiwan. Gamers will benefit from the new Core X-series as it will allow them to do 4K gaming while streaming over the internet. Content creators on the other hand can take advantage of up to 10 cores/20 threads to quickly output digital content. More iterations will be made available later on, which include 12, 14, 16 and 18-core variants. ADVERTISEMENT Intel also positions the X-series as the processor of choice for overclocking. All the new Core X-series processors will be working with a new X299 motherboard chipset. Intel notes that partner products equipped with this new chipset should begin coming out in the next few weeks. Image: Intel For the true enthusiast, Intel offers the Core i9 Extreme Edition which boasts 18 cores/36 threads. The processor is also the first of its kind in Intel’s lineup. With all its horsepower, Intel pegs the processor for use in virtual reality, advanced gaming and content creation. For pricing, the initial wave of X-series processors will start with the Core i5 7640X X-series with 4 cores/4 threads at $242 (roughly P12,000). The highest-end i9 7900X X-series that has 10cores/20 threads will be priced at $999 (nearly P50,000). As for the Core i9-7980 Extreme Edition, it will have 18 cores/36 threads and a price of $1,999 (almost P100,000). Coincidentally, AMD announced their own 16-core processors codenamed “Threadripper” just over a week ago.

This is by far the fastest desktop processor every released, but Intel is actually introducing a total of 9 processors for the new ‘Basin Falls’ X299 platform ranging in price from $242 for a quad-core Intel Core i5-7640X all the way up to $1,999 for the Intel Core i9-7980XE 18-core monster. The new Intel Core X-Series used the brand new LGA2066 socket and consists of a mixture of ‘Skylake-X’ and ‘Kaby Lake-X’ CPUs. Since this is a new desktop CPU socket, it means that you’ll need an ‘Basin Falls’ X299 HEDT (High-End Desktop) platform to run any of these new processors. Intel’s new X299 platform and raises the bar for CPU performance with support of up to 18 cores, support for up to 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 directly connected to the CPU, and Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. When it comes to memory support, the X299 platform supports up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory for an incredibly potent and flexible platform. Who needs a $1,999 processor with 18-cores and 36-threads like the Intel Core i9-7980XE for 1080P gaming? No one on a budget, but that really isn’t the target audience for the Intel Core X series. Intel is suggesting the Core X-series for 12 gaming, 4K/12K VR gaming and live streaming, 360 degree 4K video editing, music creation with over 16 tracks and lastly those that do 3D modeling and animation. It also is coming to compete with AMD’s new brand of processors called ThreadRipper that have up to 32 cores and will be coming out this summer as well. AMD is entering the HEDT market for the first time in years and the Threadripper is going to bring a solution derived off AMD’s EPYC server processors just like Intel does with Xeon server processors. We all saw the AMD versus Intel battle in this segment coming, but it’s actually here now! Here is the table of Intel’s nine is processors that make up the Core X-Series processor family. The bottom two parts (Intel Core i5-7640X and Core i7-7740X) are based on Kaby Lake-X while all the rest are Skylake-X processors.   The first thing you might notice is that Intel isn’t revealing everything today.  Intel is only revealing clock speeds and details on the 4-core to 10-core parts and keeping the 12, 14,16, and 18-core parts a secret until mid June. As we already mentioned the Intel Core i9-7980XE is the flagship processor with 18c/36t for $1999, but don’t let that price freak you out. Take a look at the Intel Core i9-7900X processor real fast. The Intel Core i9-7900X has 10 cores, 20 threads with 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes and clock speeds of up to 4.5GHz for $999.  Less than one year ago we saw Intel introduce the Intel Core i7-6950X with 10 cores, 20 threads, 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes and clock speeds of 3.5 GHz for $1,723. Intel has slashed the price of their 10-core processor by $724! So, you might get hung up on the fact that there is a $1,999 desktop processor now, but when you take a second look pricing has actually improved over last year thanks to pressure in this market space from AMD. All of the processors are interesting, but another standout would be the Intel Core i7-7800X at $389. This processor has 6 cores, 12 threads, a 3.5GHz base clock, 4.0GHz Turbo Boost 3.0 clock, 28 PCIe lanes and quad-channel DDR4 2666MHz support. That isn’t a bad price as it is around $50 more than the current Intel Core i7-7700K quad-core processor and $10 less than the MSRP of the AMD Ryzen 7 1700X processor. A good number of high-end gamers are willing to spend $400 on a processor, so we see this processor being the most popular as to go up to the Core i9-7820X 8-core/16-thread processor will cost you over $210 more. Let’s take a look at some of the new Intel technologies for the unlocked Intel Core X-Series Processor Family! Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

It has finally done that today. Intel announced its new family of high-end Core X desktop processors today at Computex 2017. The new family brings more powerful models of the existing Core i5 and Core i7 models as well as a new Core i9 line for those who require more power. Intel is targeting its Core X platform of high-end processors towards gamers and content creators, the kind of people that actively seek out the best in PC technology. Intel has built almost all of the new Core X family on its updated Skylake platform that it calls Skylake X. The two 4 core models are built on Kaby Lake X architecture. Intel has developed the Core X with scalability in mind so there are entry-level models with 4 cores and the top-of-the-line Core i9 Extreme model which according to Intel is the first consumer desktop processor to feature 18 cores and 36 threads. The entry level model, Core i5-7640X, offers 4 cores and 4 threads for $242. The Core X i7 models are slightly more expensive with prices starting at $339. Intel will be offering a total of five Core i9 models, including the Core i9 Extreme, with prices starting at $999 for the 12 core and 24 thread model to a whopping $1,999 for the 18 core and 36 thread model. All of these new processors will work with Intel’s new X299 motherboard chipset which will be out on partner products in a few weeks. Filed in Computers.

This new platform brings unprecedented power to professional content creators, hardcore gamers or anyone that demands serious performance.  The new Intel Core X-Series processors are available with up to 18 cores and support 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory and multiple graphics cards and PCIe NVMe SSDs thanks to 44 PCIe lanes on the CPU and even more from the chipset. ASUS today announced that they will be offering Intel X299 based boards in three motherboard series; Prime, TUF, and ROG. All three of these series feature dedicated pump headers for powering custom loops and all-in- one coolers, plus intelligent fan controls for quiet and efficient system cooling. All of the Intel X299 boards have RGB LEDs that make up the ASUS Aura Sync lighting ecosystem and solid audio thanks to SupremeFX integrated audio graphics. ASUS X299 boards also support Intel VROC technology that can be combined with ASUS’ optional add-in M.2 card to enable insane M.2 RAID arrays made up of a stack of parallel drives with a direct line to the CPU. This means you can hit ludicrous speeds of over 10,000 MB/s on sequential Read and Writes with the right drives! Let’s take a closer look at the ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe that was designed for high-end builders who want it all. The ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe motherboard is a standard sized ATX board that supports three-way graphics configurations from NVIDIA or AMD. The three main x16 slots feature ASUS SafeSlot technology that have structural reinforcements to ensure the slots don’t get damaged over the years with heavy graphics cards. You won’t find any SATA Express slots on this board, but you will find a U.2 port for enterprise-grade SSDs! We are glad to see SATA Express slots go after all these years as we never used one and never got a retail product to test for the site. When it comes to M.2 PCIe slots the Prime X299-Deluxe comes with dual M.2 slots for gumstick-sized NVMe drives. The primary (main) slot sits under the chipset heatsink, which ASUS says reduces drive temperatures, while the secondary one mounts drives vertically near the DIMM slots, where they can be exposed to airflow generated by system fans. These M.2 slots will work with a bootable RAID array, so get ready to see some wicked fast storage solutions on the Intel X299 platform. On the ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe we have been told that ASUS went with Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier for the SupremeFX audio solution. When it comes to networking performance ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe motherboard has an integrated 802.11ad Wi-Fi module. The dual-band solution can push wireless rates up to 4.6Gbps—several times the speed of most wired connections. And the Deluxe has you covered on the wired front, too, with dual Intel Gigabit Ethernet controllers delivering fast and reliable connectivity. We were hoping to see something beyond Gigabit for wired LAN on this generation, but that didn’t happen on this board/ If you want 10G ethernet you’ll need to move up to the ASUS ROG Rampage VI Extreme. ASUS ran out of room on this standard size ATX board, so they included a daughter board called the ThunderboltEX 3. This add-in card features two USB Type-C connectors and a USB 3.1 Gen 2 connector for 40Gbps of bandwidth to external peripherals. ASUS didn’t give us a photo of the Fan Extension card that is also included that adds additional fan headers and temperature sensors to the ones already on the board. ASUS ROG Strix X299-E Gaming Motherboard The ROG Strix X299-E Gaming is the lowest priced Republic of Gamers (ROG) board in the X299 series for ASUS and they say that they didn’t have to sacrifice the looks and features to do so. This standard ATX sized board features dual M.2 slots for PCIe NVMe SSDs, Intel Gigabit networking, onboard Wi-FI, USB 3.1 Gen2, SupremeFX audio technology with Sonic Studio III and RGB lighting options with Aura Sync. ROG Rampage VI Extreme, Rampage VI Apex and ROG Strix X299-E Gaming motherboards will be available in North America starting in late June with the STRIX series arriving first. ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe, Prime X299-A and TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboards will be available in late June as well. Suggested MSRP pricing will be announced on 6/26/2017, so we expect that to be the day the ASUS STRIX X299 model will be launched.

As we have come to expect from ASUS there is a diverse range of models split between the Prime, TUF, and ROG series. Although we don't yet have access to full specifications lists, given the capabilities of the Skylake-X processors - like a quad-channel memory controller and up to 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes - all of the motherboards share certain obvious characteristics like eight DDR4 memory slots, a ton of PCIe slots, at least two full-speed M.2 slots, and both 8-pin and 4-pin CPU/EPS power connectors to handle the elevated power draw of high core count processors. Since it is the feature du jour all of the models also have some form of AURA RGB LED lightning. As you will see below, with so many PCIe lanes coming from the CPU and even more from the chipset, these X299 motherboards have an unprecendented amount of expansion and storage connectivity. Prime: X299-Deluxe & X299-A Since it is the backbone of the ASUS motherboard lineup, let's start off with the Prime series which will initially consist of the higher-end Prime X299-Deluxe and more affordable Prime X299-A. The Prime X299-Deluxe - pictured above - is a standard ATX form factor model that carries over the black and white aesthetic of its forebearers, though with some fancy new flourishes. It has an 8-phase digital CPU power design managed by some variant of the DIGI+ PWM controller. There are both 8-pin and 4-pin CPU/EPS power connectors, which should come in handy if a high TDP 18-core Skylake-X processor is installed. There are Japanese 10K capacitors used throughout the motherboard, not counting the Nichicon audio-grade capacitors used in the onboard audio section. The eight Q-DIMM memory slots are clipless on one side, and they can handle up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. No word yet on what the highest supported overclocked memory speed is for this model. While this motherboards has four mechanical PCIe x16 slots, only the two grey ones are actually x16 capable. The middle slot is limited to x4 and the bottom slot is limited to x8. This means that the X299-Deluxe will 'only' be able to handle three-way graphics configurations. Three of the four PCIe x16 slots have been given the SafeSlot treatment, which is to say that they have been mechanically reinforced with steel and additional anchor points for superior retention and shearing resistance. There are also two PCIe x1 slots. Storage connectivity appears quite good with six SATA 6Gb/s ports, one U.2 port, and two M.2 slots that support SATA, PCI-E, and PCI-E NVMe M.2 solid state drives. Intel's new Optane Memory technology is also supported. One of the M.2 slots is under the large chipset heatsink and the other is next to the right bank of memory slots, and has been designed to hold M.2 drives vertically. In addition, the motherboard supports six USB 2.0 ports (four rear, one header), eight USB 3.0 ports (four rear, two headers), and six USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (four rear, one header). Focusing on the full-speed USB 3.1 Gen2 ports, there are three Type-A ports and one Type-C port on the rear I/O panel, and a USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel internal header next to the memory slots. If that wasn't enough, ASUS are also including their ThunderboltEX 3 add-on card, which means Thunderbolt 3 capabilities, 40Gbps transfer speeds, and 36W of power delivery to external peripherals. When it comes to networking, there are two gigabit LAN ports powered by some variant of Intel controller, and an onboard dual-band Wi-Fi solution that supports the new 802.11ad protocol and is capable of theoretical tranfer rates up to 4.6Gbps. The onboard audio duties are handled by a new Crystal Sound implementation, which features a Realtek S1220A codec paired to an amplifier, Nichicon audio-grade capacitors, and a PCB-level audio isolation line. If you want a motherboard that looks even better than it sounds, the highly customizable Aura Sync RGB LED lighting feature is well-represented on this model. There are unique-looking and independently controllable light bars integrated into the rear I/O shield and the chipset heatsinks, there is a 4-pin header that can power RGB LED light strips, and thanks to Aura Sync you can synchronize the colors and effects of compatible products to match that of your motherboard. While we are on the topic of aesthetics, one of the more unusual new features is the OLED screen has been integrated into the chipset heatsink. Known as LiveDash, it is capable of displaying system information like temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds, or it can display custom graphical animations or text messages for no other reason than to make your build unique. Rounding things out are the usual assortment of value-added features like the USB BIOS Flashback feature, Q-Code Debug LED, diagnostics LEDs, onboard power and reset buttons, clear CMOS button, EZ_XMP switch, MemOK! button, and the EXT_FAN header. That last header is important because it leads us to the fact that ASUS is also bundling their Fan Extension card, to further expand the X299-Deluxe's already generous assortment of CPU and system fan headers and temperature sensors. When it comes to the Prime X299-A - for which we have no picture - this model omits a few of the extras found of the Deluxe model in order to reach a more affordable price point. However, it will have the same 8-phase digatal CPU power design, it will also support up to three-way graphics configurations, it will have two M.2 slots, and have similar if not identical storage and USB connectivity. The onboard audio solution should be identical as well. When it comes to differences, we expect this model to only have one gigabit LAN port, and to also not feature any onboard Wi-Fi solution. It should have a more simplistic chipset heatsink and be missing at least one of the two integrated light bars. However, it will have two RGB LED light strip headers instead of the one on the Prime X299-Deluxe. Needless to say that we don't expect the ThunderboltEX 3 add-on card or the Fan Extension card in this model's accessories bundle. TUF: X299 Mark 1 & X299 Mark 2 Moving on to the TUF series, these models prioritize reliability and durability thanks to tougher components and more stringent testing. This series is comprised of the TUF X299 Mark 1 and the slightly stripped down TUF X299 Mark 2. Like previous TUF Mark 1 motherboards, this TUF X299 Mark 1 model features a protective armor and advanced cooling options. Not only does the cover prevent dust from accumulating on the board, but it helps direct the integrated fan's airflow to the proper areas, like towards the primary M.2 slots. Speaking of fans, there are four fan headers near the CPU socket and six other spread throughout the motherboard. In order to manage thermals you need to be able to monitor temperatures, and this model takes care about with a number of onboard temperature sensors that monitor seperate zones on the motherboard and then feed that data into the Thermal Radar 3 utility. The TUF Detective mobile app returns, but this serving as a wireless means of diagnosing and monitoring the system via a smartphone. Although not visible, the Mark 1 features a Fortifier backplate, which ASUS claim is their strongest one yet. This metal plate serves to stiffen the motherboard against warping, but it helps dissipate heat from various thermal hotspots that can appear on the back of the PCB. ASUS has also included a removable GPU Holder that can support the weight of a graphics cards, and prevent strain on the PCIe slots. When it comes to basic specs, this model shouldn't disappoint. It features same the 8-phase digital CPU power design and 10K Japanese capacitors as the two Prime series model. It has eight SATA 6Gb/s port and two M.2 slots. There is one USB 3.1 Gen2 header, two USB 3.0 headers, and one USB 2.0 header. While we do not have a picture of the rear I/O panel, we do know that this model has at least one USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-A port and USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C port, as well as dual Intel-powered gigabit LAN ports. This motherboard has three visible PCIe x16 slots, only of two of which are actually x16 capable. Both of those PCIe x16 slots are steel-reinforced SafeSlots, which should protect them from the shearing effects of heavy graphics cards. The third PCIe x16 slot is limited to x8, which means that this model can still handle up to three-way SLI or CrossFire. There are two open-ended PCIe x4 slots which can physically support expansions cards with up x16 connectors. There is also one PCIe slot that is not visible to us since it is hidden under armor cover, but which is likely a PCIe x1 slot. There is RGB LED lighting integrated into the logo at the center of the board, and it will glow different colors based on the system load. If that is not enough lighting for you, there is also what appears to be a RGB LED light strip header at the very bottom of the motherboard. Rounding out the known features list is an onboard power button, a MemOK! button, and diagnostics LEDs. The more affordable TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down some of the Mark 1's unique features to create a more conventional motherboard. Much like the Prime X299-A is to the Prime X299-Deluxe, this model delivers much of the same functionality, but at a more affordable price. ASUS has done this by removing the protective armor and the backplate. It also loses two SATA 6GB/s ports - down to six total - and one of the PCIe x4 slots has been swapped for a PCIe x1 slot. There is also no USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel header on this model, and the total fan header count has been reduced from ten down to seven. On the plus side, the TUF X299 Mark 2 appears to have greater onboard RGB LED lighting, with LEDs mounted under much of the right side of the motherboard. However, there does not appear to be an LED light strip header anywhere on the Mark 1.

POST A COMMENT 11 Comments View All Comments Gothmoth - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link the strix is a bit short on USB connections.. not? Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link FWIW, WCCFtech has a picture of what's supposed to be the Strix's rear IO. Assuming the picture is valid, each 'header' referred to in this article refers to a pair of ports not 1 for a total of 8 (7xA, 1xC); which is a much more reasonable number of ports for a high end board (even if there is room for a few more due to the lack of other IO). http://wccftech.com/asus-rog-strix-x299-e-motherbo... Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Is the USB3.1g2 header proprietary or a new standard? I'm hoping the latter; not just because proprietary connectors suck; but because the big header from 3.0 needing twice the space of a 1.x/2.0 header is an impediment to putting larger numbers of headers on the board than the 1 or occasionally two we get today. Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link I think it's rather disappointing that the Prime X299-delux only has a single C port on the rear. In models with lower port counts it's a semi-defensible decision although even there I'd prefer 2x C ports because A ports aren't fully forward compatible with C ports (lower max power allowed: 2.4A vs 3 or 5A). But with 12 total ports and 4x 3.1g2 ones it's a very poor decision IMO for a product that's likely to be used for at least 4 years. Reply Quil0n - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link It has the add-in board with TB3 ports, though Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link That card only adds a single USB-C port; and has a cost of 4 PCIe lanes. The latter is at most a minor issue with the 44lane chips, depending on how they're routed it could be a problem for the 28 and 16 lane versions if they're cutting into CPU lanes that would otherwise go to a GPU. Costwise it's a stupidly inefficient way to add a C port vs just configuring a additional A ports as Cs. Reply TEAMSWITCHER - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Seven X299 Motherboards! Carving the HEDT market up with a scalpel. LOL! Reply drajitshnew - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Please let us know where all the ports are coming off. Which utilise PCIe from the processor and which use the PCH Reply Gothmoth - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link where is an article about the displayed x399 boards at computex? Reply tlp95129 - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Looks like these boards have a screw-in heatsink mounting system. Great! I've always hated those push pins. The thought of a $500 CPU going up in smoke due to a pin slipping out of the hole scares me to death. ( I know, I know, the overtemp will be detected before that happens, but still ...).

Alan Martin @alan_p_martin 30 May 2017 whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email After years of seeking efficiency rather than raw power in the world of laptop processors, the CPU arms race has suddenly got a bit more interesting. Last year Intel released the first 10-core consumer CPU for those with wallets that were just too damned heavy. AMD, not to be outdone, then released a 16-core Threadripper CPU, to which Intel has a big, if predictable, response: 18 cores and 36 threads; shoot the works.

As with Intel’s older Extreme edition CPUs it’s based on the previous-generation Skylake architecture, but it’s still plenty powerful, packing over a teraflop of power into its diminutive frame. It’s the spearhead for a new line of chips for enthusiasts known as the Core X-series, which also come in 10, 12 14 and 16-core flavours if you want to save a few quid. But you’ll still be spending a lot. The 18-core beast at the top of the pile will retail for $1,999 (~£1,554), while the 10-core Core i9-7900X still goes for an eye-watering $999 (~£777). Video of Introducing the Intel Core X-Series Processor Family As for speed, only one of the new Core i9 chips has confirmed specifications. It runs at a base frequency of 3.3GHz, which can be boosted to 4.5GHz with Turbo Boost 3.0 and has a TDP (thermal design power) of 140W. Intel hasn’t forgotten those on lower budgets with the X-Core series, with three new i7 and an i5 chip with in 4, 6 and 8-core flavours, starting at $242 (~£188). Is all of this overkill? For 99% of people reading this, yes. But Intel is banking that 1% of remaining enthusiasts being spendthrift enough to make the range a success, and judging by how well the 10-core Broadwell E models went down last year, you wouldn’t bet against them.

Intel has taken to the stage at Computex in Taipei to unveil its newest range of processors, dubbed the X-Series. With its eyes set on content creators, overclockers and pro-gamers (plenty of whom are crowding the Computex halls this week) Intel is pulling out all the superlatives it can muster to talk up the "extreme" processing power offered by its new prosumer range. Popular Searches General Motors Co GM ▲ 34.45 +0.02 +0.06% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 155.45 +2.27 +1.48% General Electric Co GE ▲ 27.88 +0.16 +0.58% Herbalife Ltd HLF ▼ 73.92 -0.19 -0.26% But extreme don't come cheap. As the world waits patiently for Intel's eighth generation processors, the company says its next iteration of seventh-gen chips will offer "extreme enthusiasts" greater speeds and less downtime with its most powerful range of processors to date. These aren't the kind of processors that are going to power your next family PC, and that's why the top-of-the-line chip will set you back a cool $2K. But the X-Series is built for a niche market. Sure, we've seen updates to processors for laptops and PCs already this year from Intel, but we didn't get anything meaningfully faster than what we already had. With the traditional PC market stagnating over the past two years, Intel has to up the ante and target high-end consumers looking for a power fix  And that's where those 18 cores come in. The X-Series will range from four to 10 core chips, with Intel promising 12-, 14-, 16- and 18-core options in the future. To put it simply, more cores give you more processing power and Intel's architecture makes sure the right core is optimised for the right job. We saw 10-core processing power with last year's Broadwell-E launch, which brought improvements in processing power and a focus on "megatasking" (think multitasking, but for people who have epic stuff to do). This year, Intel is going one better with "extreme megatasking." (There's that "E" word again). Aside from sounding like a side-effect of too much caffeine, that essentially means the ability to run multiple "compute intensive" tasks at a time. As examples, Intel said editors could run Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop and Lightroom and handle multi-gigabyte files without a meltdown. Content creators will be able to stitch together six concurrent 4K streams to create 360-degree video like it's no big deal. Pro gamers will be able to capture 4K gameplay, livestream it to fans and record their highlight reel all at once. And overclockers? They'll have all the knobs they've ever dreamed of.  We saw some of these features with Broadwell-E, but as with all chip updates, the X-Series promises to do it faster, better and with less downtime. We're also getting updated Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 to improve single- and dual-core performance. Now, time for the price tag. The 10-core X-Series (Core i9-7900X) will retail for $999 (£780, AU$1,340), while 18-cores of grunt (Core i9-7980XE) will retail for $1,999 when it's released (£1,560, AU$2,683). And don't forget, that new processing power will need a new motherboard (the new CPUs use a new socket) so you're looking at a significant overhaul of hardware. But at least it will be extreme.

Barely bigger than a credit card, the Compute Card is basically the foundation of a modular PC. Under the hood, a Compute Card has a low-power Intel processor, memory, storage, and just about everything else you need to run a modern operating system. But it’s not really designed to be a standalone PC. Instead it’s designed to slot into smart TVs, laptop or desktop docks, or other devices… allowing you to swap or upgrade cards at will instead of buying a whole new device. First unveiled at CES in January, the Compute Card is set to begin shipping in August, 2017. Intel made the announcement at the Computex show in Taiwan, where the company also spelled out a few new use cases. First up, Compute Cards could be used in VR headsetssta… like the HTC Vive, which Intel demonstrated working wirelessly using Intel WiGig tech. We already knew that NexDock plans to launch a laptop shell that’s powered by a Compute Card. But now Intel has revealed a few bigger-name partners. Dell, LG, and Lenovo all plan to offer products designed around the Compute Card platform. Intel has also unveiled a new Docking System designed to help developers integrate Compute Card support into their devices… or which could be offered as a standalone solution that lets you use a Compute Card as a desktop computer. Slide a Compute Card into the dock and you get USB 3.0, Ethernet and HDMI and/or DisplayPort functionality. While Intel still hasn’t had much to say about the spec sheets for these little compute modules, we recently learned that Intel plans to launch models with Celeron N3450, Pentium 4200, Core M3-7Y30, and Core i5-7y57 processors. Each version should have 4GB of RAM with entry-level models featuring 64GB of eMMC storage and higher-end versions using 128GB of PCIe SSD storage.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Samsung Chromebook Pro launches for $550 05/29/2017 at 10:16 AM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Samsung’s first Chromebook with an Intel Core M processor and a convertible tablet-style design is just about ready to go. Amazon, B&H, and Newegg are all taking orders (or pre-orders) for the Samsung Chromebook Pro for $550. The laptop looks virtually identical to the $450 Samsung Chromebook Plus that launched earlier this year, but while the Plus has an ARM-based processor from Rockchip, the Chromebook Pro has an Intel Core M3-6Y30 Skylake processor which should offer better performance… for some tasks. One of the key selling points for convertible Chromebooks is their support for Android apps, which are optimized for touchscreen displays. But Android-on-Chrome OS is still a beta feature, and there have been some recent supports suggesting that Android apps currently run better on Chromebooks that have ARM processors than on those with Intel chips. That said, if you’re more interested in running Chrome OS itself and/or Ubuntu or another Linux-based operating system, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a pretty nice looking machine. The $550 laptop features a 12.3 inch, 2400 x 1600 pixel touchscreen display with pen support, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of eMMC storage. It measures 11.1″ x 8.7″ x 0.5″ and weighs about 2.4 pounds. The notebook isn’t just competing with Samsung’s ARM-powered model though. Earlier this year Asus launched the Chromebook Flip C302, which features a Core M3 Skylake CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. You can pick up an Asus Chromebook Flip C302 for $499, making it cheaper than the Samsung Chromebook Pro. But at 2.7 pounds, the Asus model is a bit heavier. And it has a lower-resolution 12.5 inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel display.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. So when will Chromebooks be able to run Android apps natively? I bought an Asus Chromebook C302, but it didn’t come with Google Play preinstalled. Even after I installed Google Play from the Beta Channel, I still couldn’t install Android apps like Firefox, Skype or Angry Birds. I got a message saying they would be installed ‘soon’. That’s the same message I got last year, trying to install Android apps on my old 2012 Samsung chromebook. Android apps for ChromeOS are not ready for prime time, so I returned the C302 for a refund. This article says the Samsung Chromebook Pro ‘supports’ Android apps, then it says “But Android-on-Chrome OS is still a beta feature”. It appears that Android apps are not ready for prime time on the Samsung Chromebook Pro either.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel X series chip details leaked, including Core i9 chip with 18 CPU cores 05/29/2017 at 12:30 PM by Brad Linder 5 Comments So you thought AMD’s 16-core “Threadripper” CPU was a beast? Intel may be preparing to launch an 18-core processor as one of its first chips to wear the Core i9 name. Intel is scheduled to deliver a keynote at the Computex show in Taiwan tomorrow, but VideoCardz has already published a leaked slide providing some details of Intel’s upcoming Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 X-series chips. The details have not been officially confirmed by Intel, but VideoCardz notes that the information comes “from multiple sources.” In a nutshell, it looks like the new Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X chips will be available with between 4 and 18 CPU cores. Most models also support hyperthreading, so an octa-core chip, for example, supports 16 threads… and an 18-core CPU supports 36 threads. Other features support for 4-channel DDR3-2666 memory, 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes, Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0, and TDPs between 140 watts and 165 watts. Clearly these chips are designed for desktops and note for mobile devices. Expect more details tomorrow.

While I love the Skylake architecture (use it in almost everything now), it is going to kind of limit these monster CPU’s cause of its limited support for decoding certain 4K streams like from Netflix. Not sure if it supports HDMI 2.0 either so while performance-wise it can certainly handle 4K content, it’s going to be a little limited with the kinds of 4K content it can handle.

Not a comparable feature set but I wouldn’t be surprised if it were over a thousand.

Of note, is the new Intel Core i9 series, and the 18-core Core i9 Extreme Edition. Typically, Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs have always been a generation behind their mainstream counterparts. For instance, Broadwell-E was launched at a time when Skylake was mainstream but this time, Intel has brought its high-end SKUs on par with today’s mainstream architectures with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs. Availability and exact pricing for India should be known in the coming months. We begin with Kaby Lake-X, which will initially launch with two SKUs – a Core i7-7740X and a Core i5-7640X. The Core i7-7740X is a quad-core CPU running at 4.3GHz and a boost clock of 4.5GHz, supports HyperThreading, 8MB of L3 cache and supports 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The Core i5 variant will run at a slightly lower 4GHz with a boost clock of 4.2GHz and does not support HyperThreading. The L3 cache is also a bit lower at 6MB but it does support the same number of PCIe lanes. Both CPUs will support dual channel DDR4 memory at up to 2666MHz and have the same TDP of 112W. Kaby Lake-X CPUs won’t support Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. Skylake-X CPUs will support Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology (except for the Core i7-7800X) along with higher core counts (up to 18 cores), more than double the PCIe lanes and support for quad-channel DDR4 memory. Intel has so far announced three SKUs for the Skylake-X CPUs, starting with the Core i7-7800X. This CPU runs at 3.5GHz with boost clock set to 4GHz and features six cores with HyperThreading. The slightly faster Core i7-7820X CPU runs at slightly higher clock speed but also packs in eight cores with 11MB of L3 cache and 28 PCIe lanes. In order to differentiate the extreme edition SKUs, Intel has introduced a brand new Core i9 series and right now, we only have details about the Core i9-7900X. The base and boost clock speeds are lower compared to the other Core-i7 models in the line up but this CPU has 10 cores with HyperThreading, 13.75MB of L3 cache and a massive 44 PCIe lanes. Intel has listed the names of future Core i9 CPUs but haven’t revealed finer details of clock speeds, cache, etc, yet. This includes the 12-core Core i9-7920X; 14-core Core i9-7940X; 16-core Core i9-7960X and the insane 18-core Core i9-7980XE. All CPUs from the Core-X family will be using Intel’s new X299 chipset, which uses a new LGA 2066 socket. The new chipset introduced features like DMI 3.0 link which should help improve throughput times and support for Intel Optane memory. It also brings I/O capabilities like support for up to 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, up to eight SATA 3.0 ports and up to 10 USB 3.0 ports. We can expect to see new motherboards from Intel’s board partners showing up in the months to come. Speaking on the launch, Gregory Bryant, Corporate Vice President and General Manager Client Computing Group said in a blog post, “The Intel Core X-series processor family introduces a series of firsts that reflect the extreme performance we are delivering. This family includes Intel’s first teraflop desktop CPUs, a prime example of just how much raw compute these processors can handle. We’re also introducing the entirely new Intel Core i9 processor, representing the highest performance for advanced gaming, VR and content creation. At the top of the lineup is the new Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor – the first consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads.” For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

A prototype of the new headset was unveiled and demonstrated at Computex in Taipei on Tuesday during a keynote by Intel, which said it's working closely with HTC to realize the system. Mentioned in this article HTC Vive  PCWorld rating $799.00MSRP $800.00View on Amazon The wireless HTC Vive looked similar to today's cabled model with the addition of a box of electronics worn on the head of the user. Intel didn't provide any details about the system, but that's presumably where the electronics and radios are fitted to make wireless VR possible. [ Further reading: The best DVRs for cord cutters ] Martyn Williams/IDG Intel's Craig Raymond demonstrates a wireless HTC Vive headset during a keynote at Computex in Taipei on May 30, 2017. The system was running over a wireless gigabit (WiGig) link and used the DisplayLink XR codec to provide what Intel said was a "low latency" wireless experience. Latency is the lag between when the user does something, like turn their head, and when the system and display reacts. Wireless can often introduce small delays that aren't present on cables, so keeping this low is key in VR, where any stuttering or unnatural movements can potentially cause nausea. Running an HTC Vive over wireless isn't an easy job. First-generation headsets like the Vive require a 6Gbps data stream, according to DisplayLink, and engineers have to ensure this data doesn't lag or fail as the user jumps and turns around. Wireless VR will free users from the messy and potentially dangerous cables that surround them when using virtual reality, but the price of all this fast wireless is yet to be disclosed.

Game on, PC fans! By: Steven Bassiri | Intel CPUs in CPUs, Chipsets & SoCs | Posted: 5 days, 20 hours ago Comment () | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Intel's New X-Series Processors] Page 1 [Intel's New X-Series Processors] Page 2 [Intel's Breakthroughs and New Technologies] Page 3 [The X299 Platform] Introduction     We all knew that the launch of Intel's Basin Falls platform was imminent and now we get confirmation on rumors and speculation directly from Intel regarding the new platform. The new platform will be Intel's "most scalable", meaning it will support CPUs with as little as four cores up to 18. That 18 core 36 thread CPU will cost almost $2000, but the new 10 core 20 thread CPU will cost $1000, while the lower-end CPU for the platform will cost under $300. They are even offering a 6 core 12 thread CPU at under $400. Yes, 18 cores with Hyper Threading, which is big news for the consumer industry. The new platform also upgrades Intel's HEDT segment to include newer technologies such as PCI-E 3.0 in the PCH. Intel has also made minor improvements and added some features to the new processors.       The X299 platform will support Kabylake-X and Skylake-X CPUs. The Kabylake-X CPUs will only come in the 4-core variety, and are pretty much transplants of their desktop counterparts. I expect the same IPC, but higher clocks, as the TDP of the Kabylake-X CPUs is 21W higher than the 7700K and I doubt it will have an iGPU. The Skylake-X CPUs will offer four more PCI-E 3.0 lanes from the CPU for your GPUs and will use the new LGA 2066 socket (same mounting as LGA2011). You might also notice shared cache has decreased compared to Broadwell-E, and this is part of a cache restructuring effort that should improve performance.     The shift to scale the X299 platform is an interesting one for Intel. They have basically added in two new core series lineups to their HEDT, signaling a change in strategy when it comes to the high performance consumer computing market. It should also result in lower platform prices, and we might see motherboards that feature the X299 chipset and only support some of the processors rather than all of them. The 10 core 20 thread i9-7900X will cost $1000, while the i9-7980XE will cost $2000 when launched. The pricing on their six-core processor, puts six Intel cores in the reach of many consumers.

Read the latest about Skylake X release date, features and specs. Intel's high-performance Skylake X-series Core i9 and i7 are here By Jim Martin | 30 May 2017 Skylake is the codename for Intel's sixth-generation range of Core laptop and desktop PC processors. They've already been superseded by the seventh-gen CPUs and you can find out how Skylake compares with Kaby Lake. But Skylake isn't dead yet. No. Intel has launched Skylake X CPUs, which are the high-end enthusiast versions. Also see: Windows 10 is coming to Snapdragon 835. Interestingly, Intel isn't using the Core i7 branding as it has done in previous years but add a new number: 9. The Core i9 range could be in response to AMD's Ryzen processors, which were named to seem similar to Intel's Core i5 and i7 ranges.  Rather than cut profit margins and compete on price, Intel might be trying to position the new chips as 'better than Ryzen 7' by using a higher number.  AMD, of course, has already announced its Threadripper range, which is expected to be branded Ryzen 9. Intel has trumped AMD's 32-core flagship chip with the 36-core i9-7980XE monster, but AMD could be keeping a similar chip under wraps for now. Pricing will be key, though, and the $1999 i9-7980XE will hit any wallet hard. When is the Core i9 release date? Release date: June 2017* At the chips' launch at Computex 2017, Intel said the new processors would be on sale "in the coming weeks". *That applies to the Core i9-7900X downwards.  The i9-7920X will go on sale in August, while the top three chips don't yet have an official release date. Originally, Skylake processors (including the Core i7-6600K and Core i7-6700K) went on sale on 5 August 2015, and the locked-multiplie desktop chips launched at the start of September 2015. What are the Core i9 models and specifications?   Core i9-7980XE Core i9-7960X Core i9-7940X Core i9-7920X Core i9-7900X Core i7-7820X Core i7-7800X Core i7-7740X Cores / Threads 18/36 16/32 14/28 12/24 10/20 8/16 6/12 4/8 L3 Cache TBC TBC TBC 16.5MB 13.75MB 11MB 8.25MB 8MB PCIe lanes TBC TBC TBC 44 44 28 28 16 Base clock TBC TBC TBC TBC 3.3GHz 3.6GHz 3.5GHz 4.3GHz Turbo 2.0 TBC TBC TBC TBC 4.3GHz 4.3GHz 4.0GHz 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 TBC TBC TBC TBC 4.5GHz 4.5GHz N/A N/A Memory TBC TBC TBC TBC Quad-channel DDR4-2666 Quad-channel DDR4-2666 Quad-channel DDR4-2666 Dual-Channel DDR4-2666 TDP 165W TBC TBC 140W 140W 140W 140W 112W Price $1999 $1699 $1399 $1199 $999 $599 $389 112W The processors will require a motherboard with the LGA 2066 Socket (called R4) and the X299 chipset, which is part of the Basin Falls platform. The eagle-eyed will note that there are three Core i7 models in that chart: Skylake-X isn't just Core i9. (However, the i7-7740X is based around a Kaby Lake Core).  There's also a single Core i5 model. These cheaper processors are aimed at enthusiasts who want an overclockable processor on a tighter budget. They have 1MB of L2 Cache, which is four times as much as the Core i7-7700K. All Core i9s support quad-channel DDR4-2666 RAM. X299 chipset Here's how the X299 chipset compares with the X99 chipset: X299 motherboards double the bandwidth to SATA and USB connectors compared to X99, and allows up to ten USB 3.0 ports and eight SATA III ports.  There are up 24 PCIe lanes provided by the chipset, but additional lanes supported by the CPU itself can be used by a motherboard for things such as NVMe storage. Original Skylake CPUs Here are the key specs for the original Skylake desktop processors, which you can buy from Amazon: Core i5-6400 Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 2.7GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 950MHz 65W Price: £149.99 inc VAT Core i5-6500 Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 3.2GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 11050MHz 65W TDP Price: £159.99 inc VAT Core i5-6600 Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 3.3GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 1050MHz 65W TDP Price: £179.99 inc VAT Core i5-6600K Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 3.5GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £199.99 inc VAT Core i7-6700 Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 3.4GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 4.0GHz 8MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 53MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £244.99 inc VAT Core i7-6700K Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 4.0GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz 8MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 53MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £263.99 inc VAT What are Skylake's features and chipsets? When it launched, one of the reasons to buy a PC with a Skylake chip was the sheer number of new features it brought. Rather than being a simple performance bump, Skylake was first to support DDR4 memory. Skylake arrived with the '100-series' chipset, codenamed Sunrise Point. The Z170 Express replaced the Z97, which itself was not a massive upgrade from Z87. The chipset supports up to 20 PCI Express 3.0 lanes, up to 10 USB 3.0 ports and 14 USB 2.0 ports. Motherboards with the Z170 Express chipset can have up to six SATA ports and an eSATA channel, plus Intel's Rapid Storage Technology for PCIe storage devices including NVMe. The Core i7 chips have 16 PCI Express 3.0 lanes for graphics which can be split into 1x 16-lane, 2x 8-lane or 1x 8-lane and 2x 4-lane channels. The memory controller supports dual-channel DDR4 or DDR3L DRAM, and they use Socket 1151. The H170 chipset replaced the H97 for mainstream PCs, while the H110 is the 'value' offering, replacing the H81 and various other chipsets. Overclocking The K versions of Skylake are multiplier unlocked. Interestingly, the base clock is separate from the PCI-E bus. This means you can adjust the core clock frequency of the chip without affecting anything else. However, overclockers will still change the multiplier and voltage to see the biggest performance gains, so there's not much change overall.

This is the first time such a "scalable, accessible and powerful desktop platform," has been offered to consumers, says Intel. With the new processors comes the new Intel X299 chipset, which adds extended I/O and overclocking capabilities. Intel Core-X Series processors The new Core-X Series offers SKUs boasting from 4 to 18 physical cores. Today Intel has detailed an initial family lineup with up to 10 physical cores. It promises that "18, 16, 14, and 12 cores are coming soon". However, at the top of the range we are teased that the 18C/36T Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor is the "first teraflop desktop CPU from Intel". Key features of the Core-X Series are as follows: Intel X299 chipset with improved I/O capabilities LGA 2066 socket for Intel Core X-series processor family Additional system performance and amazing responsiveness with Intel Optane memory support Improved Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 (select SKUs) for single- and multithreaded performance Up to 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 directly connected to the CPU Up to 4 channel DDR4-2666 memory support, support for the Intel Extreme Memory Profile (Intel XMP) specification, revision 2.0 for DDR4 Fully unlocked for performance tuning Rebalanced smart cache hierarchy I think it would be a good time now to look at a table that summarises the initial batch of Core-X series offerings. The currently available top Intel consumer CPU from is the 10C/20T Core i9-7900X, with a TDP of 140W, at $999. At the other end of the table you can see the 4C/4T Core i5-7640X, with a TDP of 112W, priced at $242. Intel talks about many of the same benefits delivered by its Core-X series processors that AMD visited with the Ryzen launch. For example, Intel says that: content creators can multitask much more smoothly and efficiently with several processor intensive tasks; and gamers can enjoy smooth gaming while they record, encode and stream their gameplay. Intel X299 Chipset Intel's accompanying new chipset is built to match the Core-X Series enthusiast aspirations. More specifically, the X299 chipset offers; 30 total high-speed I/O lanes, up to three Intel Rapid Storage Technology PCIe 3.0 x4 storage support, support for Intel Ethernet Connection I219 (Jacksonville LAN PHY), and are Intel Optane memory ready with DMI 3.0. In tabulated form you can check through the base tech specs below. X299 motherboards and systems supporting Intel Core-X Series processors will be available in the coming weeks from Intel partners. Intel will have more announcements at Computex 2017 including shared details of the Intel Compute Card, VR innovations, new devices with Intel processors, and some information regarding the 8th generation Intel Core processors.

Register today! Posted by azrael- - Tue 30 May 2017 11:40 I do so love how Intel can't help themselves artificially segmenting their processors. While AMD has no problem supporting ECC in their mainstream Ryzen processors Intel fuses off this functionality in their desktop offerings. And of course that must equally be so for their rebranded Xeon processors. Heaven forbid that anyone get Xeon features when not paying Xeon prices… Posted by 00oceanic - Tue 30 May 2017 12:00 I can't help but think that none of this would have happened if AMD didn't have a strong product. Posted by watercooled - Tue 30 May 2017 12:16 Apparently they won't be soldering the die to the IHS again, which could be a bit of a nightmare with so many cores able to boost to very high clocks: https://www.overclock3d.net/news/cpu_mainboard/intel_s_skylake-x_and_kaby_lake-x_cpus_will_not_be_soldered/1 Also of note is how they're moving away from an inclusive L3 cache, which is interesting given the similar design choices made by AMD for Ryzen. It seems Intel's isn't quite a victim cache as it still has prefetchers, but I also wonder how the ring-bus is implemented in these HEDT Skylake parts. Posted by tantaku - Tue 30 May 2017 12:38 It's great that intel actually tries hard now.

I have to admit I find Intel's product and platform names completely and utterly confusing, but from what I gather, the company announced new high-end i7 and i5 processors, as well as even higher-end, high-core counts i7s and a new line, the i9. The X299 chipset brings it all together. I was keeping an eye on these new processors as I just ordered all the parts for my brand new computer, but I had already decided not to wait for these since I prefer not to jump onto new processors and chipsets right away (which is why I didn't opt for Ryzen either). Looking at the replacement for the processor I eventually settled on - the 7700K - I'm pretty sure I made the right call, since the speed bump seems minor (100Mhz), while TDP goes up relatively considerably. The high core count processors are - much like the Ryzen 7 1800X - incredibly alluring in a "I want all the cores" kind of way, but for the most part, few workloads actually benefit from more cores in processors. Aside from workstation-oriented workloads I personally do not engage in, it really seems like processors are running ahead of the software they run. Still, with Ryzen and now Intel's new parts, there's a ton of choice out there if you're building a new computer.

The Intel Core i9 is the world's first ever consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads – out gunning even AMD's upcoming Ryzen 9 Threadripper CPU, which is due to come out with 16-cores. It is also the first ever teraflop desktop CPU, according to Intel. So, it looks like Intel and AMD are engaging in a full-on CPU arms race again – which is exciting news for us consumers. Its full name is the Intel Core i9-7900X X-series processor, and this first version will be made available with 10 cores and 20 threads, with 18, 16, 14 and 12 core variants coming soon. The 10-core i9 variant will come with a base clock speed of 3.3GHz, Inel Turbo Boost Max technology, which ups the frequency to 4.5GHz, 13.75MB of L3 cache, support for 4 channels of DDR4-2666 RAM and a TDP (thermal design power) of 140W. At launch it will cost $999 (around £780, AU$1300). The 18-core Core i9 7980XE, along with the 16-core Core i9 7960X, 14-core Core i9 7940X and 12-core Core i9 7920X should follow soon. All will come with up to 44 PCIe lanes and support for Intel Optane memory. Keeping it in the X-Series family While the new Core i9 CPUs are understandably stealing the limelight, Intel also revealed the rest of the X-Series family of processors, which Intel says is its most "scalable, accessible and powerful desktop platform ever", and covers a range of processors with 4 to 18 cores. These eighth generation Core processors offer a 30% performance improvement over the current seventh generation CPUs, according to Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group at Intel Corporation, who took to the stage at Computex to announce the new generation. These CPUs will also be up to 10% faster for multi-thread performance, and up to 15% faster for single-thread performance compared to the current generation of Core processors. These new processors will make use of Intel's new X299 chipset, which comes with improved I/0 capabilities. Gaming, and virtual reality in particular, will benefit from these new processors, according to Intel, and will also improve streaming for gamers who want to show off their gameplay.   At the launch event Intel demoed a PC running a Core X-Series processor that was live streaming someone playing a virtual reality game to Twitch. Thanks to the power improvements of the new CPUs, the PC was able to simultaneously broadcast a number of views and angles of the gameplay live – something that would normally take a number of separate PCs to achieve. It's all very exciting stuff, and Intel said that we should see many Core X-series processors available to buy by the holiday system this year. Maybe even in time for Black Friday, we hope.

It was aimed at real enthusiast, with performance that had a niche market and a price of $1799 that put it well out of most people’s grasp. A year later, and two things are clear. One, Broadwell-E was a rousing success. And two, Intel is feeling the heat from AMD. Why else would the company who has been so confident in quad-core processing reveal an 18-core CPU? The Core i9 series of CPUs has been rumoured for some time now, but Intel have officially revealed the line at Computex. It’s lead by the i9-7980XE – a behemoth of a CPU that features 18 cores, 36 threads, a base clock speed of 3.3 GHz (with boosts of around 4.3 and 4.5 with different modes), and a price of $1999. It’s the to[ of the top, aimed at heavy video editing users or gamers who want to play at 4K while streaming their footage in HD at the same time. It’s Intel posturing to AMD, who have their top of the line Ryzen chip launching later this year. That’s only ringing in at 16 cores, which somehow seems inadequate now with Intel’s announcement. The Core i9 series is making sweeping changes all round too. Based of an improved version of Skylake (called Skylake-X), the chips will come in 16, 14, 12 and 10 core variants. The 10-core, which is the equivalent to the Broadwell-E, is now only $999. That’s how much of a difference a year makes. Read  Corsair’s Zeus mouse pad charges your mouse wirelessly, so you never have to worry The X-Series, as Intel calls it, won’t just be made up of Core i9 processors. The range is rounded out by quad-core i5-7640X and i7 models in 4, 6 and 8-core models, the smallest of which aren’t even based on Skylake-X technology. It’s a broad sweep of the spectrum from Intel though, catering to nearly every demographic in its line that you could possibly think of. It’s also a strong return to desktop computing, which Intel had somewhat left to the wayside with its advances in more mobile CPU chips. This all ahead of what is rumoured to be Coffee Lake – the next generation of processors that Intel claim are already seeing 30% performance improvements over Skylake.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel strikes back at AMD with overclockable… Intel strikes back at AMD with overclockable X-Series, led by 18-core monster By Matt Smith — Updated May 30, 2017 10:09 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Intel's X-Series contains its fastest processors ever and looks to hold of competition from AMD's Ryzen. Intel isn’t taking AMD’s new Ryzen processor lying down and has responded by launching a lineup of new processors at Computex 2017. The Core X-Series, widely leaked before release, does not just focus on high-end successors to Intel’s previous Core i7-5960X and 6950X. It is a broad new series that spans from a four-core, four-thread Core i5 to a Core i9 (yes, Core i9 is now a thing) with 18 cores and 36 threads. Technically, the X-Series is not new. The designation was already used for Intel’s fastest processors. But it was not much of a series, as it was limited to just Intel’s most powerful processor. As you can see in the table below, the new X-Series family provides an option at most budgets. Processor Base Clock Boost Clock Cores Threads L3 Cache Price Intel Core i9-7980XE N/A N/A 18 36 N/A $1,999 Intel Core i9-7960X N/A N/A 16 32 N/A $1,699 Intel Core i9-7940X N/A N/A 14 28 N/A $1,399 Intel Core i9-7920X N/A N/A 12 24 N/A $1,199 Intel Core i9-7900X 3.3 4.3 10 20 13.75MB $999 Intel Core i7-7820X 3.6 4.3 8 16 11MB $599 Intel Core i7-7800X 3.5 4.0 6 12 8.25MB $389 Intel Core i7-7740X 4.3 4.5 4 8 8MB $339 Intel Core i5-7640X 4.0 4.2 4 4 6MB $242 The flagship is, of course, the Core i9-7980XE, which has 18 cores and 36 threads, and has earned the title of “Intel’s first teraflop processor.” Sneaking it in at Computex gives Intel an important morale victory of AMD, which recently announced its 16-core, 32-thread ‘Threadripper’ processor. The cost of the victory, however, is an incredible $2,000. We imagine AMD’s alternative will be less expensive. Architecturally, the chips are a combination of Skylake and Kaby Lake hardware. Skylake is the foundation of everything with six cores or more, while Kaby Lake lies under the pair of four-core chips. Given its scope, the focus of expanded Core X-Series might seem hard to understand. Still, Intel says it stands out in two ways: Platform and overclocking. All Intel Core-X processors will use the new LGA 2066 socket, and run on the new Intel X299 platform, which is loaded with features. It supports up to 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 bandwidth off the processor and 24 lanes for chipset I/O. Hardcore gamers can use that to run two cards at full PCIe x16 speed or four video cards at x8 speed, on motherboards with appropriate third-party support. X299 also supports up to four-channel DDR4 2666 RAM. That is a big upgrade over the X99 platform. The first chipset to support DDR4, X99 was officially rated only for DDR4 2133. As you might expect, X299 supports Intel’s cutting-edge Optane memory. It can also support up to three Intel Rapid Storage Technology drives. While the platform upgrades are nice, overclocking will be the winning feature for enthusiasts. All Intel Core X-Series processors will be unlocked. That massively increases the number of overclock-friendly chips available from Intel. The massive core count on top-tier X-Series processors, combined with overclocking support across the range, has forced Intel to take cooling seriously. Intel recommends a closed-loop CPU liquid cooler for every processor in this line. Intel will sell its own option, the TS13X, which has a 150-millimeter radiator. While most of the announcement focuses on the new chips and chipset, there are two feature changes in the processors themselves. The processors will support the latest Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, which can dynamically increase the clock speed of up to two cores above the usual limit, to maximize performance in workloads that are not heavily multi-threaded. Intel also announced support for the AVX-512 instruction set, though we are not aware of any consumer software that’ll take advantage of that tweak. We are sure the pricing of the new X-Series will cause some controversy. The entry-level part only has four cores, and four threads yet sits at almost $250. That is in line with the six-core, 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 1600X. Intel’s per-core performance is still quicker than AMD, however — and the clock speeds on Intel’s components are nothing to laugh at. We cannot wait to see how the fight between these premium Intel components and AMD’s top-tier Ryzen chips, plays out over the coming year.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel talks 8th-gen Core at Computex, claims 30… Intel talks 8th-gen Core at Computex, claims 30 percent performance gain By Matt Smith — Updated May 30, 2017 2:26 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If early claims prove right, Intel's eighth-gen processors will easily beat their predecessors, giving enthusiasts reason to upgrade their CPUs. Intel’s highly anticipated X-Series processors stole the show at company’s Computex 2017 keynote, but they weren’t the only CPU-related announcement. Gregory Bryant, general manager of Intel’s Client Computing Group, also reassured enthusiasts that the upcoming eighth-generation hardware is on track. “We will have more to say about the eighth-gen Intel Core processor in the future” Bryant stated in an official press release, “but it’s exciting to share that in the latest testing we’re seeing a performance improvement of more than 30 percent over the seventh-gen Intel Core processor.” That improvement is, according to Intel’s notes, based on comparing eighth-generation hardware to an Intel Core i5-7500U processor in SYSmark 2014. It appears Intel is obtaining at least some of its gain through improved clock speed. The Core i5-7500U has a maximum Turbo Boost clock of 3.5GHz, while the theoretical eighth-generation chip used by Intel for its comparison has a maximum Turbo Boost of 4GHz. Intel says the projected performance gain is subject to a seven percent margin of error. A 30 percent boost for eighth-generation hardware would give Intel’s processor lineup some relief. While its processors are still faster than AMD’s Ryzen in terms of per-core performance, the modest generation-over-generation gains in recent Intel hardware have bored many PC enthusiasts. The last few generations have improved by 10 to 15 percent when compared to their predecessor. While Intel did provide an estimate of the gains its new hardware might provide, the company offered few other details. The exact release date is unknown, and it’s unclear which processor family will first receive the eighth-generation treatment. Intel’s decision to base its claim of 30 percent better performance on the Core i5-7500U, which is a laptop-class chip, suggests mobile PCs will take point. That, however, is simply speculation on our part. Whatever the case, we’re eager to hear more about Intel’s new hardware later this year, and equally eager to see AMD’s response.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel debuts Compute Card at Computex 2017, with… Intel debuts Compute Card at Computex 2017, with Dell and HP as partners By Jon Martindale — Updated May 30, 2017 8:21 am Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Intel's fast but tiny Compute Card pushes the limit on what small PCs can do, and may enable new, more powerful IoT products. Intel has officially unveiled its Compute Cards at Computex 2017, giving us our first look at the super-slim, fully functioning PCs. Along with a selection of differently specced processors, they all come with 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of onboard PCI Express, solid-state (SSD) storage. Intel has already secured a number of partners in this venture, so we can expect Compute Card enabled products to arrive before the end of the year. Taking microcomputing in a more powerful direction than the Rasbperry Pi and its contemporaries, Intel’s Compute Cards are designed as a spiritual successor to the Compute Stick. Slim and entirely self-contained, they will offer powerful, fully capable computing functions for modular systems. In the future, upgrading your laptop or smart appliance could be as simple as removing the old card and plugging in the new. As well as not being marketed to bedroom hackers like many credit card-sized systems, Intel’s Compute Cards are much more capable. Besides the RAM and storage mentioned, Compute Cards offer quad core and dual core processors ranging from the sixth-generation Celeron N3450 and Pentium N4200, to the seventh-generation M3-7Y30 and i5-7Y57. With up to 3.3GHz with onboard Intel HD graphics, the chips consume no more than 4.5 watts of power, making them very efficient and capable of performing in such a small space without overheating. Storage options include 64GB of eMMC flash storage with the older, Apollo Lake CPUs, while the more modern Kaby Lake options come with 128GB of PCIExpress SSD storage. One area where the Compute Card is a little different from more traditional micro-PCs is in connectivity. They have a standardized, bespoke connector which allows it to be used in a docking system for consumer usage, or slotted into smart appliances and other devices to make connectivity easier for third party manufacturers. Along with the announcement at Computex 2017, Intel detailed some of the partnerships it had already formed to support the Compute Card. LG and Lehui will be using it for the creation of new smart monitors, while Mo-Bit Electronics and TabletKiosk will use them to create tablets for consumers and the medical field. We’re also told that Dell, Lenovo and HP will have supporting Compute Card products in the future, though they have yet to make any product announcements. As the largest PC manufacturers in the world, it wouldn’t be too speculative to suggest that they will likely make laptops built around the Compute Card system. Other products that Intel suggests the Compute Card could be used in include smart mirrors, digital signs, robotics systems, smart vehicle infotainment, and virtual reality headsets. The rumored pricing for a stand-alone Compute Card ranges from $150 for the low-end models, up to $500 for the more expensive options. Intel has slated their release for August this year, so we should see compatible products launching alongside and shortly after. Updated on 05-30-2017 by Jon Martindale: Confirmed details from Intel announcement and added partner and shipping information.

When an age-old competitor re-entered the field, it provided new life into a somewhat dormant platform: how to bring high-performance computing and experiences to the premium segment of the market that was not interested in the business aspect of the ‘professional’ side. Over the last several years in this space, we have seen Intel launch Sandy Bridge-E, Ivy Bridge-E, Haswell-E and Broadwell-E. Today marks the announcement for the next set of processors, named Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X. But like the platforms before, built on X79 and X99 chipsets, these two new processor families will be covered by the new X299 chipset, code-named Basin Falls. Normally we expect to see each generation of Intel’s HEDT platform be a generation behind the mainstream parts: Sandy Bridge-E was launched when Ivy Bridge was mainstream, Broadwell-E was launched when Skylake was mainstream and so on. There was always a delay in cadence, given that these HEDT CPUs, which are derived from the enterprise CPUs, required more time to qualify but also as a market segmentation strategy. For today’s launch of Basin Falls, this strategy changes. With X299, Intel is launching HEDT processors based on Skylake, called the Skylake-X family, and processors based on Kaby Lake, called the Kaby Lake-X family. This is a name change from the ‘Broadwell-E’ family which used an E, and now we assume the X stands for Xtreme. All the processors in this family will have an X in them, and the bottom model starts as a six-core processor, putting it above the quad-core parts found in the mainstream platforms. Skylake-X, as we understand it, was initially set to have up to 12 core components, harvesting the smaller silicon used in the enterprise Xeon family. Part of today’s announcement is that Intel will also bring the middle-sized enterprise silicon to consumers, with Skylake-X parts being offered up to 18 cores. This is a break in what we traditionally get on the HEDT platform. Kaby Lake-X will re-use Kaby Lake-S silicon, but with the integrated graphics disabled and better design specifications to push the frequency higher over the mainstream versions. Basin Falls This news piece centers around X299 however: the chipset and the motherboards that will bear this chipset. X299 is a marked change from previous X-series chipsets, thanks to the Z-series chipsets on the mainstream processor line. For a couple of generations, the Z-series chipsets have adopted the HSIO (High-Speed IO) topology, essentially allowing the chipset to act like a big PCIe switch. Using the DMI 3.0 link from the processor, which by any other name is essentially a PCIe 3.0 x4 link, the chipset can support 20-24 lanes of PCIe 3.0 from it in various combinations.  With access to 20-24 PCIe lanes from the chipset, rather than having to bother the CPU for PCIe lanes and reduce potential graphics performance, motherboard manufacturers were able to go overboard with additional functionality. This has included more SATA ports, more networking ports, higher performance networking ports such as 10G, extra storage ports, elements such as PCIe storage in an M.2 form factor, or add special unique features specific to that motherboard manufacturer’s package. While there is technically an uplink bottleneck, that is rarely hit unless a user decides to play with multiple high-speed PCIe 3.0 x4 storage devices. What X299 brings to the table for HEDT is this HSIO concept, mirroring the consumer chipset platform. New controllers, such as Aquantia’s AQtion multi-gigabit ethernet chips as well as PCIe storage are now available on the high-end desktop platform for motherboards that implement them. In order to get the same level of coverage, motherboard manufacturers used to have to use a PEX PLX switch – since being bought by Avago, these switches are now 3x the cost, and they introduced a small amount of latency for offering more functionality. The new chipset design hopefully negates those issues. Z170 had 20 HSIO Lanes, Z270 has 24. X299 has 24 also. The DMI link also changes, moving from DMI 2.0 speeds in X79/X99 to DMI 3.0 speeds in X299 to mirror the consumer platforms. As mentioned above, this is practically the same as a PCIe 3.0 x4 link, but at least the HEDT platforms now get to play with higher bandwidth. X299 is also going to promote Optane support with the 16GB/32GB Optane drives that are currently on the market available for Intel RST caching modes, as with the Z270 platform. This is somewhat of a non-story, given that X299 is high end: we would expect anyone looking into the Basin Falls ecosystem to already be considering an SSD as an operating system drive to begin with. Optane support only really helps with systems that still want rotating rust (a mechanical HDD) as a main drive. There is support for Optane PCIe SSDs as well, but in essence these are just PCIe drives which would be supported anyway. Intel has not commented on Optane DRAM support, but this is unlikely, given it has not even been announced for enterprise platforms (and reports suggest it is further away than we initially thought). So unlike the consumer platforms, we only have one chipset to worry about with HEDT (as is normal). X299 will support natively up to eight SATA 3.0 ports, and up to 10 USB 3.0 ports. We expect there to be some mixing and matching here, but we are waiting for information from Intel, along with the TDP. Intel hasn’t stated which of the SATA ports support RST/RAID, however also to gain parity with the consumer platform, X299 will support RAID with up to three PCIe 3.0 x4 devices. However in order to get the maximum peak bandwidth, motherboard manufacturers will have to derive all the ports from the CPU, not the chipset. Which brings us on to the biggest quirks with Basin Falls. Supporting 16, 28, and 44 PCIe Lane Processors As part of the announcement today, Intel is announcing three sets of processors if we band them together by PCIe lane count. The Kaby Lake-X quad core CPUs will feature 16 PCIe lanes, whereas the Skylake-X family will split between 28 PCIe lanes for the low-end processors and 44 PCIe lanes for the high-end processors. One of the requirements for X299 is that every SKL-X and KBL-X processor must work in all X299 motherboards. If you have ever picked apart a motherboard block diagram, or had to deal with issues from previous HEDT platforms relating to what is enabled with what CPU, this can only generate a headache for both motherboard manufacturers and users alike. In order to explain this, here’s an example. Say a motherboard manufacturer is designing a mid-to-high end motherboard. They have three PCIe slots from the CPU for graphics, supporting x16/x16/x8 (or x16/x16, x16/x8/x8 or x8/x8/-). The board also supports a CPU based 10G network controller (4 lanes), but also in order to get the best storage performance, they also have two PCIe 3.0 x4 storage slots based on M.2. If a user has a 44 lane CPU in place with two storage drive, the GPU slots can move to x16/x16 or x16/x8/x8, leaving 12 PCIe lanes for the network controller and storage. If a user has a 28 lane CPU in place with a storage drive, the GPU slots can move to x8/x8 with 12 lanes for network controller and storage If a user has a 16 lane CPU in place with one storage drive, the GPU slot can be x8 with the network controller and storage active, or if the GPU slot(s) is x16 or x8/x8, then the network controller and PCIe storage is disabled, unless muxes and quick switches are equipped on the motherboard to carry the signal around such that the PCIe storage moves to chipset based, or defaults to SATA only, or etc etc etc The minute you try and put high-end configurations onto a system, without careful planning (and the expense of routing the signals and muxing/switching the pathways), if a user puts a cheaper processor in place they might lose access to all the extra functionality they paid for. ASRock X299 Professional Gaming i9, with 3x PCIe 3.0 x4 and 10GbE: SKL-X Focused The other element is the memory configuration issues. The Kaby Lake-X processors will support dual-channel memory, whereas the Skylake-X processors support quad-channel memory. This means that motherboard vendors will have one of three configurations: Eight DRAM slots, for four channels at 2 DIMMs per channel (2 DPC) Four DRAM slots, for four channels at 1 DPC Four DRAM slots, for dual channel at 2 DPC Not only do you have to make sure the board supports your configuration, but for the four-slot designs, if a user chooses the middle option, four slots for four channels at 1DPC, any Kaby Lake-X processor will only be able to use two slots. For the eight DRAM slot design, Kaby Lake-X processor users will have to ensure that if they have two of four memory modules that they are in the right slots, and the motherboard manufacturers have to ensure that the users can easily determine which ones are in use otherwise they might see the memory but not have the performance, or vice versa. This is arguably a big mess. In order to compensate, boards might not implement the high-end configurations, meaning that a top of the line processor might not use all the features it comes with. What we will likely end up seeing is a split strategy from the motherboard manufacturers. We will see motherboards targeted at either Skylake-X or Kaby Lake-X. All CPUs will work in all boards, but if you pair a SKL-X CPU with a KBL-X focused motherboard, the user may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the CPU they paid for. Vice versa, putting a KBL-X processor in a SKL-X focused board, a number of features that the motherboard has will be unavailable to you. One of my requests for the motherboard manufacturers as I have met them over the last few visits is that they need to explain how the motherboards are configured in excruciating detail. This means block diagrams, and not just one diagram: have separate diagrams of what is available if a user decides to implement a 16, 28, or 44 lane processor in play. All that being said, I can see annoyance on the horizon if users do not do the research. While adding support for quad-core KBL-X processors on the HEDT platform is an interesting move, it’s not one I would have suggested without bringing parity on the PCIe lane count (although that would require new silicon dies, and perhaps would not be worth the cost of designing them). Perhaps a final note about X299 based motherboards. All will support overclocking on the CPU and DRAM, with multiplier and base clock frequency adjustments expected. Typically with a new launch, the motherboard manufacturers will run internal overclocking events using any manner of sub-zero coolants in order to launch with as many overclocking world records as possible. We are told to expect records to be broken with both KBL-X and SKL-X, though it will be interesting to see how that translates into 24/7 overclocks.

Ideally I'm looking for something like a 7700K with the usual marginal 10-15% performance improvement. I don't really need this HEDT platform... my 2600K is a little long in the tooth, though. Reply jabber - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link "Outside of the clear upgrade path provided by the XXXX motherboard, what's the real advantage of getting a XXXXXX CPU when XXXXXX is only months away?" Doesn't this get mentioned every time a new CPU range comes out? Why do folks still bother mentioning this? It's life. Reply peterfares - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link When that releases it will only be for mainstream, possibly only mobile at first. HEDT lags behind mainstream quite a bit, the higher core count CPUs they just announced are based on 6th-gen cores. Reply drgigolo - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Except that Kaby Lake doesn't have any new features that really gain performance, whereas Skylake-X has 4 times larger L2 cache per core, so Skylake-X might actually have higher IPC than Kaby Lake. Little is known about Coffee Lake afaik. Might not be a huge difference from Kaby Lake except coming out with a 6-core part and GPU increases? Reply naxeem - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link CL is going to be 10nm, that alone will give a lot of room for overclocking... Reply edzieba - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link die shrinks do not necessarily mean more OC headroom. As transistors get smaller, they can take less voltage, and heat up faster. Traditionally shrinking transistors lowered the required switching voltage to overcome this, but for the last few generations the tables have been turning. Reply Santoval - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link I think you confused the CLs. Coffee Lake will still be based on 14nm. Cannon Lake is the 10nm design.

Intel’s successor to Broadwell-E has been expected for some time, and today Intel is announcing the new platform, Basin Falls (using the X299 chipset), as well as two new processor families: Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X. Normally we expect to see each generation of Intel’s HEDT platform be a generation behind the mainstream parts: Sandy Bridge-E was launched when Ivy Bridge was mainstream, Broadwell-E was launched when Skylake was mainstream and so on. There was always a delay in cadence, given that these HEDT CPUs, which are derived from the enterprise CPUs, required more time to qualify but also as a market segmentation strategy. Today’s announcement starts with Skylake-X, the new set of processors to replace the previous generation Broadwell-E parts. The twist to the announcement today is that Intel will also launch the latest generation microarchitecture on the HEDT platform. So rather than being a generation behind in microarchitecture, Intel will bring a pair of processor families forward for HEDT with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X. The rub of this is that these new processors, the ones based on the latest microarchitecture, are actually physically the same as the consumer parts. They are quad-core components, using the same 4+2 silicon, but with a higher power budget by disabling the integrated graphics. This means higher frequencies and more performance, albeit at the steep end of the power/performance curve. If a user wants the absolute ultimate in single threaded performance on the high-end desktop platform, then these CPUs are designed to be the center point of your design decision. Depending on your perspective, this can be a good thing – a new peak processor for single thread performance, or a side-step compared to what a high-end desktop platform should be bringing. Intel Kaby Lake Processors   Core i7 Core i5 Core i7-7740X Core i7-7700K Core i5-7640X Core i5-7600K Socket LGA2066 LGA1151 LGA2066 LGA1151 Cores/Threads 4/8 4/8 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 4.3 GHz 4.2 GHz 4.0 GHz 3.8 GHz Turbo Frequency 4.5 GHz 4.4 GHz 4.2 GHz 4.2 GHz TDP 112 W 91 W 112 W 91 W L2 Cache 256 KB/core L3 Cache 8 MB 6 MB DRAM Channels 2 DRAM Support DDR4-2666 DDR4-2400 DDR4-2666 DDR4-2400 Graphics None HD 620 None HD 620 Price $339 $242 Launched Soon Jan 2017 Soon Jan 2017 The two Kaby Lake-X processors are the Core i7-7740X and the Core i5-7640X. Intel is differentiating them from the K versions of the same processors, and thus being part of the X299/LGA2066 Basin Falls platform, with the X in the name. X CPUs for X chipsets. Both of these processors will be quad-core parts, and thus be the lowest core counts out of the set. Like the consumer parts, these will have only sixteen PCIe lanes, as well as dual channel memory. This makes choosing an X299 motherboard, which also has to support processors with quad-channel memory and 44 PCIe lanes, difficult (see our coverage of X299 for a deeper explanation). We are expecting the silicon in Kaby Lake-X to be identical to Kaby Lake-S, which in Intel’s nomenclature means a 4+2 arrangement (four cores with GT2 graphics). What separates the two is that Kaby Lake-X will have its graphics fused off, which means unused silicon but also allows the IGP to no longer be a draw on the power available to the processor. The other difference will be in the power delivery – Kaby Lake-X design specifications for motherboard manufacturers supports more voltage pins and larger voltage pathways, which should help with power delivery. If we directly compare the Kaby Lake-S and Kaby-Lake X specifications, two things stand out. First, the official support for higher grade memory: DDR4-2666, over the DDR4-2400 on the consumer platform. Second is the twining of frequency and TDP: for the Core i7-7740X, we get +100 MHz on the base frequency and +100 MHz on the turbo frequency, but the TDP increases from 91W to 112W, or a 21W increase for 100 MHz. I know at this point we are at a bad part of the power/performance curve, but such a jump in rating seems overly excessive. It is likely that the chip will do essentially the same 91W, but if there’s a particularly bad piece of silicon that passes the test, it might go up that high. The Core i5-7640X is in a similar predicament, with the comparison to the Core i5-7600K yielding a +200 MHz to the base frequency but not a lot else for the same power jump. If we were running on specification sheet alone, both processors would perform worse in the performance per watt and afford more cost due to being part of the X299 platform, with more expensive motherboards and such. A word on pricing. The numbers above are listed as 1K pricing, or tray pricing, for OEMs that want to buy processors in batches of 1000. For individual units, especially ones with an air heat sink, the retail pricing should be another 5-10% on top of this. So the Core i7-7740X is listed here as $339, the same as the Core i7-7700K for tray pricing and expected to be $350 at retail. The Core i5-7640X is listed as $242, again the same as the Core i5-7600K, and thus should be on shelves for $259 or so. So Who is Kaby Lake-X for, Exactly? We have our theories, but the official line from Intel is in the name of ‘more choice’ and ‘overclockability’: The two Kaby Lake quad core processors were introduced for broader expandability of the platform. The Intel® Core i5-7640X and Intel® Core i7-7740X enable customers to invest in a more powerful enthusiast platform that provides more headroom and scalability up the X-Series stack when they are ready. These two processors will start with a slightly higher base frequency and provide all of the ingredients, like higher memory speed and larger socket, for better overclocking performance compared to their mainstream counterparts. That said, our Intel Core i7-7700K and the S-line are still great options and by introducing the X-series we’re giving a wide variety of consumers the benefit of choice. Intel is promoting its own brand liquid coolers for Kaby Lake-X The more choice line is neither here nor there – more choice is not always good choice, but someone will buy it. The overclocking element is something we can’t test by looking at specification sheets at an announcement event. The retail launch (and reviews) of these chips is not today, so even if we knew, we can’t comment. Could you argue that being part of the X299 platform gives the processor more potential to be clocked higher? It could be perhaps skewed that more control allows for better performance, but depending on the environment (such as the solder contact between the silicon and the heatspreader), if it is the same silicon then there might not be much in it, except for extreme overclockers. So Who is Kaby Lake-X for, Really? If it’s good at extreme overclocking, it’s a nod to that enthusiast community. Two other sets of users spring to mind: the high single-thread frequency, if that translates into daily overclocking, will work wonders for financial traders where every millisecond means money; but also in previous generations we used to see users invest a small amount in a platform and then go big on the CPU later: users who want X299 could invest in a quad core Kaby Lake-X processor today, and then go for a larger twelve core in 12-18 months. How big this market is, we’re not sure. A Few Notes Because Intel is launching Kaby Lake-X alongside Skylake-X, it is worth pointing out that there are some very big differences between the two aside from the core counts and pricing. Kaby Lake-X has the same design, structure, and features as Kaby Lake-S. So this means access to the second generation of Speed Shift, but no ECC support. While Skylake-X supports AVX-512 extensions, Kaby Lake-X does not. While Skylake-X supports a new cache hierarchy, with an increased L2 and an adjusted L3, Kaby Lake-X does not. The thing is, Intel is set to launch Kaby Lake-X processors with more than four cores at a later date. I would expect some of those processors to support the new Skylake-X features. Like Skylake-X, some of these will be Core i7 and some will be Core i9. So there will be a split in features between quad-core and more-than-quad-core Kaby Lake-X CPUs. Confused yet? Launch and Availability Intel has its customary keynote as part of the Computex show, and we will be live blogging it. They are likely to announce dates and availability there, and we’ll update this piece as we know. (I’m still flying to Taipei, so there might be a delay.) We’re unsure when we’ll be sampled, but we expect to have a launch day review. It will be interesting to see where these parts sit in relation to Kaby Lake-S, or if it really does overclock. Gallery: Intel Basin Falls Slide Deck Update On Overclocking Finally, ASUS had a hush-hush overclocking event in Taiwan for their band of high-ranking overclockers (and Anton was allowed to attend). On the cards was overclocking with Liquid Helium, which runs at 4 degrees above absolute zero (-269C). Normally extreme overclockers play with Liquid Nitrogen, which sits around -176C, but by comparison is a lot cheaper. Liquid Helium costs about $5 a liter, and the tube to carry it from the tank to the copper pot (used on the CPU when sub-zero overclocking) costs around $5000. I won’t go into the ins and outs of extreme overclocking here, or the merits of such an endeavor (it’s an argument we’ve had before), but a few nuggets of information came out of the event. Firstly, the professional overclockers managed 7557 MHz encoding stable, with all four cores (no hyperthreading), on Kaby Lake-X. For comparison, Kaby Lake-S CPUs manage around 7100 MHz. The absolute world record frequency is around 8800 MHz, held by Andre Yang on an AMD FX-8350 processor, although the KBL-X CPU wins here with IPC. Secondly, Kaby Lake-X uses a thermal interface paste, rather than an indium-tin solder that we have seen on HEDT processors in the past. This raises a number of points, such that extreme overclockers will have to delid to get the best out of the processor, but also it offers a mixed message from Intel. Intel is consistently saying that they’re for enthusiasts, and want to provide the best solutions available especially for the cutting edge of overclocking. Using a cheaper thermal paste over an indium-tin solder is one way so save 1 cent on a $350 CPU. Intel might argue that delidding a CPU is a common thing for extreme overclockers to do, and it makes little different to the majority of users who will buy the processors. That may be true, but it doesn’t show commitment. Does Intel need to show commitment? It depends on how strong they what their marketing message to be at the end of the day. Anton's Report on the Event: In a bid to demonstrate overclocking advantages of its new X299 platform as well as the Kaby Lake-X processor over “typical” Kaby Lake-S chips in LGA1151 packaging accompanies by the Z170/Z270 PCH, Intel and its partners organized “Performance Matters” event during Computex 2017. During the event, world’s renowned overclockers, including Der8auer, Dancop and Shamino attempted to set new records in KBL overclocking using liquid helium (LHe) cooling. As Intel promised, the new CPUs in LGA2066 packaging outperformed processors with similar dies in LGA1151 form-factor. For example, Der8auer has managed to push the Core i7-7740X CPU to 7577.1 MHz with 1.99 Vcore with all four cores (sans Hyper-Threading) enabled. This is a noticeable improvement over Der8auer’s previous record set earlier this year, when he overclocked the Core i7-7700K to 7328.3 MHz (in 4C/8T config) on an ASUS Z270 motherboard under liquid helium. Both CPUs were delidded and their thermal interfaces were replaced with a new compound. Keep in mind that when Der8auer overclocked his Core i7-7700K in January, he did it in a regular room with normal temperature and humidity. The “Performance Matter” event was held outside at 26°C – 27°C with high humidity, which somewhat handicapped the new Core i7-7740X. Without such a handicap, the results could have been better. The almost 250 MHz difference between results demonstrated by KBL die in LGA1151 and LGA2066 packaging proves that the latter have a higher overclocking potential (assuming that we are dealing with cherry-picked processors that can handle high voltages, ultra-low temperatures, etc.). There are multiple reasons why the Kaby Lake-X outperform their regular counterparts: an improved power supply circuitry of the 2066-pin form-factor, fused-off iGPU (effectively increases dissipating die area), a larger PCB (that also dissipates heat and when it comes to extreme overclocking its dissipation matters, which is why professional overclockers put that much thermal paste on their CPUs) and somewhat better binning along with higher TDP. From an end-user point of view, extreme LHe overclocking does not make a lot of sense – this is Formula 1 of computing and you don’t drive an F1 car to groceries. Meanwhile, the aforementioned 250 MHz difference clearly shows advantages of the Intel X299 platform over the Z270. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

The Core X platform is being targeted squarely at enthusiast customers like gamers or gamers and content creators — people who want to be able to run the latest games at the best possible resolution while streaming footage and running a chat with viewers or have four different creative tools open at once to put together a new vlog. To that end, the Core X series scales from models with 4-cores topping out with the $1,999 Core i9 Extreme, which Intel proudly points out is the first consumer desktop processor to offer 18-cores and 36-threads. The Core X family starts with the Core i5-7640X at $242, which offers 4-cores and 4-threads. The Core i7 X-Series range from a $339, 4-core / 8-thread model to a $599 10-core / 20-thread chip. As for the Core i9? Intel will be offering four models (not counting the i9 Extreme mentioned earlier) ranging from $999 for a 12-core / 24-thread processor to a $1,699, 16-core / 32-thread chip. All the new desktop Core X processors are designed to work with Intel’s new X299 motherboard chipset, which the company notes should be rolling out on partner products in the coming weeks, along with the new processors. In terms of chip architectures, almost all of the Core X family is built on off an updated version of Intel’s 6th generation Skylake platform, which the company refers to as Skylake X. The two 4-core models at the bottom of the range — the i5-7640X and the i7-7740X — are built on Kaby Lake X. Intel is also upgrading its Turbo Boost technology on some of the higher end models of the Core X line, with what it calls Turbo Boost Max 3.0. The company points out that while the additional cores on the Core X models will improve multitasking performance, the addition of technologies like Turbo Boost Max 3.0 ensures that each core is also able to achieve improved performance. (Intel claims that the Core X series reaches 10 percent faster multithread performance over the previous generation, and 15 percent faster single thread). The new, multi-core models also show that Intel is serious about keeping up with AMD, whose recently released Ryzen processors are seen by many as the first viable competitor to Intel’s juggernaut Core series in years. AMD is planning to release its own high-end enthusiast Ryzen line — dubbed the “Threadripper” — later this year with up to 16-cores and 32-threads, something that the newly announced 18-core i9 Extreme will compete head-to-head against. In addition to the new high-end Core X family, Intel also had a brief update on the still forthcoming 8th-generation line of mainstream Intel chips, rumored to be code-named Coffee Lake. While early reports from the company promised a 15 percent improvement over the current 7th generation Kaby Lake line, today Intel announced that it’s seeing even greater performance, with improvements up to 30 percent over Kaby Lake. That said, there’s still no update on when we’ll start seeing the so-called Coffee Lake chips in actual computers. Related links: The Verge.

The longer I stay in the technology industry, they become further and further apart. There are several reasons to be surprised: someone comes out of the blue with a revolutionary product and the ecosystem/infrastructure to back it up, or a company goes above and beyond a recent mediocre pace to take on the incumbents (with or without significant financial backing). One reason is confusion, as to why such a product would ever be thought of, and another is seeing how one company reacts to another. We’ve been expecting the next high-end desktop version of Skylake for almost 18 months now, and fully expected it to be an iterative update over Broadwell-E: a couple more cores, a few more dollars, a new socket, and done. Intel has surprised us with at least two of the reasons above: Skylake-X will increase the core count of Intel’s HEDT platform from 10 to 18. The Skylake-X announcement is a lot to unpack, and there are several elements to the equation. Let’s start with familiar territory: the first half of the processor launch. Announcement One: Low Core Count Skylake-X Processors The last generation, Broadwell-E, offered four processors: two six-core parts, an eight-core part, and a top-tier 10-core processor. The main difference between the two six-core parts was the PCIe lane count, and aside from the hike in pricing for the top-end SKU, these were iterative updates over Haswell-E: two more cores for the top processor. This strategy from Intel is derived from what they call internally as their ‘LCC’ core, standing for ‘low core count’. The enterprise line from Intel has three designs for their silicon – a low core count, a high core count, and an extreme core count: LCC, HCC, and XCC respectively. All the processors in the enterprise line are typically made from these three silicon maps: a 10-core LCC silicon die, for example, can have two cores disabled to be an 8-core. Or a 22-core XCC die can have all but four cores disabled, but still retain access to all the L3 cache, to have an XCC processor that has a massive cache structure. For the consumer HEDT platform, such as Haswell-E and Broadwell-E, the processors made public were all derived from the LCC silicon. The first half of the Skylake-X processor llineup follows this trend. Intel will launch four Skylake-X processors based on the LCC die, which for this platform will have a maximum of 12 cores. All processors will have hyperthreading. Skylake-X Processors (Low Core Count Chips)   Core i7-7800X Core i7-7820X Core i9-7900X Core i9-7920X Cores/ Threads 6/12 8/16 10/20 12/24 Base Clock 3.5 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.3 GHz TBD Turbo Clock 4.0 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.3 GHz TBD TurboMax Clock N/A 4.5 GHz 4.5 GHz TBD L3 8.25 MB 11 MB 13.75 MB TBD (Likely 13.75 MB) PCIe Lanes 28 44 TBD (Likely 44) Memory Channels 4 Memory Freq DDR4-2400 DDR4-2666 TBD TDP 140W TBD Price $389 $599 $999 $1199 The bottom processor is the Core i7-7800X, running at 3.5 GHz with a 4.0 GHz turbo. This design will not feature Intel’s new ‘favored core’ Turbo 3.0 technology (more on that below), but will have six cores, support quad-channel memory at DDR4-2400, come in at a TDP of 140W, have 28 PCIe lanes, and retail for around $400. This processor will be the entry level model, for any user who needs the benefit of quad-channel memory but perhaps doesn’t need a two-digit number of cores or has a more limited budget. Next up is the Core i7-7820X, which hits a potential sweet spot in the LCC design. This is an eight-core processor, with the highest LCC base clock of 3.6 GHz and the joint-highest turbo settings: 4.3 GHz for regular turbo and 4.5 GHz for favored core. Unlike the previous processor, this CPU gets support for DDR4-2666 memory. However in another break from Intel’s regular strategy, this CPU will only support 28 PCIe lanes. Normally only the lowest CPU of the HEDT stack would be adjusted in this way, but Intel is using the PCIe lane allocation as another differentiator as a user considers which processor in the stack to go for. This CPU also runs in at 140W, and comes in at $600. At this price, we would expect it to be competing directly against AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X, which will be the equivalent of a generation behind in IPC but $100 cheaper. Comparison: Core i7-7820X vs. Ryzen 7 1800X Intel Core i7-7820X Features AMD Ryzen 7 1800X 8 / 16 Cores/Threads 8 / 16 3.6 / 4.3GHz (4.5 GHz TMax) Base/Turbo 3.6 / 4.0 GHz 28 PCIe 3.0 Lanes 16 11 MB L3 Cache 16 MB 140 W TDP 95 W $599 Price (MSRP) $499 The third processor is also a change for Intel. Here is the first processor bearing the new Core i9 family. Previously we had Core i3, i5 and i7 for several generations. This time out, Intel deems it necessary to add another layer of differentiation in the naming, so the Core i9 naming scheme was the obvious choice. If we look at what the Core i9 name brings to the table, the obvious improvement is PCIe lanes: Core i7 processors will have 28 PCIe lanes, while Core i9 processors will have 44 PCIe lanes. This makes configuring an X299 motherboard a little difficult: see our piece on X299 to read up on why. Right now the Core i9-7900X is the only Core i9 with any details: this is a ten core processor, running with a 3.3 GHz base, a 4.3 GHz turbo and a 4.5 GHz favored core. Like the last processor, it will support DDR4-2666 and has a TDP of 140W. At this level, Intel is now going to charge $100/core, so this 10-core part runs in at a $999 tray price ($1049 retail likely). One brain cell to twitch when reading this specification is the price. For Ivy Bridge-E, the top SKU was $999 for six-cores. For Haswell-E, the top SKU was $999 for eight-cores. For Broadwell-E, we expected the top SKU for 10-cores to be $999, but Intel pushed the price up to $1721, due to the way the enterprise processors were priced. For Skylake-X, the new pricing scheme is somewhat scrapped again. This 10-core part is now $999, which is what we expected the Broadwell-E based Core i7-6950X to be. This isn’t the top SKU, but the pricing comes back down to reasonable levels. Meanwhile for the initial launch of Skylake-X, it is worth noting that this 10-core CPU, the Core i9-7900X, will be the first one available to purch. More on that later. Still covering the LCC core designs, the final processor in this stack is the Core i9-7920X. This processor will be coming out later in the year, likely during the summer, but it will be a 12-core processor on the same LGA2066 socket for $1199 (retail ~$1279), being part of the $100/core mantra. We are told that Intel is still validating the frequencies of this CPU to find a good balance of performance and power, although we understand that it might be 165W rather than 140W, as Intel’s pre-briefing explained that the whole X299 motherboard set should be ready to support 165W processors. In the enterprise space, or at least in previous generations, Intel has always had that processor that consumed more power than the rest. This was usually called the ‘workstation’ processor, designed to be in a single or dual socket design but with a pumped up frequency and price to match. In order for Intel to provide this 12-core processor to customers, as the top end of the LCC silicon, it has to be performant, power efficient, and come in at reasonable yields. There’s a chance that not all the factors are in place yet, especially if they come out with a 12-core part that is clocked high and could potentially absorb some of their enterprise sales. Given the expected timing and launch for this processor, as mentioned we were expecting mid-summer, that would have normally put the crosshairs into Intel’s annual IDF conference in mid-August, although that conference has now been canned. There are a few gaming events around that time to which Intel may decide to align the launch to.

POST A COMMENT 181 Comments View All Comments WorldWithoutMadness - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link 18C/36T. Soon, AMD'll revise threadripper up to 20C/40T and we'd have two giant fighting of +1/+2 of each others. Reply SunLord - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link AMD can probably move to 32C/64T at any time they please as Threadripper uses the same socket as the Naples/Epyc server cpu the biggest limiter would be motherboards as they are designed to limits AMD imposed on the Threadripper system such as quad channel and 44 pcie so AMD would have to do some tweaking to make it work with those limiters. Reply tuxfool - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link AFAIK, it isn't the same socket. Threadripper uses SP3r2 whereas Epyc uses R3 sockets. Reply Samus - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Much like Intel's HEDT CPU's use a different socket (2011 opposed to 1151) so it makes sense to have a different socket especially if more PCIe lanes are being introduced. Thank you AMD for making Intel interesting again. LOL. Reply ddriver - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link The difference is that unlike intel, amd is not going to introduce a new and incompatible socket revision for every CPU revision. Obviously, the increased number of i\o requires a new socket, so you are going to have one for mainstream, one for hedt and one for server, that is pretty much inevitable. What is achievable is socket longevity, an aspect in which intel deliberately sucks big time. Reply JKflipflop98 - Saturday, June 03, 2017 - link You know, I see AMD fanboys all over the internet use this same line and it just befuddles me. Why on Earth do you even care about socket compatibilities? Why would you EVER buy a brand new CPU, then immediately castrate its performance across the board by shoving it into some old and outdated motherboard? If you're really that strapped for cash, why are you spending money on PC upgrades? Reply ddriver - Sunday, June 04, 2017 - link It is because you are technologically ignorant. Motherboards do not bottleneck CPUs. Even memory controllers are now integrated in the CPU, so how fast your memory is depends on the CPU, the mobo only provides the slot to plug it into. Intel is not deliberately rendering sockets obsolete to maximize performance, but to force people to purchase more mobos, thus more chipsets from them. A good mobo can be 300-500+$ investment. That's a significant amount of money to save. It can enable to you get substantially faster CPU or GPU for that saved money. Reply melgross - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link You can't just double the core count. Where are they going to put those cores? I assume that the silicon isn't just sitting there waiting for them. Reply mickulty - Saturday, June 03, 2017 - link All of AMD's high-end CPUs are based on the same 8-core die, "zeppelin". Ryzen is one zeppelin, threadripper is two connected by infinity fabric on a multi-chip module, naples is four again connected by infinity fabric on a MCM. AMD could very easily put out a chip with more zeppelins, although maintaining socket compatibility would mean losing some i/o capability. Interestingly this means Ryzen has 32 PCIe lanes on the chip but only 16 are actually available on AM4. Presumably this is something to do with Bristol Ridge and Raven Ridge AM4 compatibility since they have less lanes. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link AMD will not and doesn't need to launch anything other than 16 core. Intel is simply playing the core count game, much like it played the Mhz game back in the days of pentium4. More cores must be better. But at that core count you are already limited by thermal design. So if you have more cores, they will be clocked lower. So it kind of defeats the purpose. More cores would be beneficial for servers, where the chips are clocked significantly lower, around 2.5 Ghz, allowing to hit the best power/performance ratio by running defacto underclocked cores. But that won't do much good in a HEDT scenario. And AMD does appear to have a slight IPC/watt advantage. Not to mention offering significantly better value due to better price/performance ratio. So even if intel were to launch an 18 core design, that's just a desperate "we got two more cores" that will do little to impress potential customers for that market niche. It will be underclocked and expensive, and even if manages to take tangible lead against a 16 core threadripper, it will not be worth the money.

The Core X family starts with the Core i5-7640X at $242, which offers 4-cores and 4-threads. The Core i7 X-series range from a $339, 4-core / 8-thread model to a $599 8-core / 16-thread chip. As for the Core i9? Intel will be offering four models (not counting the i9 Extreme mentioned earlier) ranging from $999 for a 10-core / 20-thread processor to a $1,699, 16-core / 32-thread chip. All the new desktop Core X processors are designed to work with Intel’s new X299 motherboard chipset, which the company notes should be rolling out on partner products in the coming weeks, along with the new processors. In terms of chip architectures, almost all of the Core X family is built on an updated version of Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake platform, which the company refers to as Skylake X. The two 4-core models at the bottom of the range — the i5-7640X and the i7-7740X — are built on Kaby Lake X. Intel is also upgrading its Turbo Boost technology on some of the higher-end models of the Core X line, with what it calls Turbo Boost Max 3.0. The company points out that while the additional cores on the Core X models will improve multitasking performance, the addition of technologies like Turbo Boost Max 3.0 ensures that each core is also able to achieve improved performance. (Intel claims that the Core X-series reaches 10 percent faster multithread performance over the previous generation, and 15 percent faster single thread.) The new, multi-core models also show that Intel is serious about keeping up with AMD, whose recently released Ryzen processors are seen by many as the first viable competitor to Intel’s juggernaut Core series in years. AMD is planning to release its own high-end enthusiast Ryzen line — dubbed the “Threadripper” — later this year with up to 16-cores and 32-threads, something that the newly announced 18-core i9 Extreme will compete head-to-head against. In addition to the new high-end Core X family, Intel also had a brief update on the still forthcoming eighth-generation line of mainstream Intel chips, rumored to be codenamed Coffee Lake. While early reports from the company promised a 15 percent improvement over the current seventh-generation Kaby Lake line, today Intel announced that it’s seeing even greater performance, with improvements up to 30 percent over Kaby Lake. That said, there’s still no update on when we’ll start seeing the so-called Coffee Lake chips in actual computers. Correction: The Core i7 X-series tops out at a 8-core / 16 thread chip for $599, not a 10-core chip at that price point. The Core i9 X-series starts at 10-core / 16-thread chip for $999, instead of the previously listed 12-core chip at that price.

MSI as ever has big booth showcasing their hardware. There are lots of Series 200 motherboards on display and the focus seems to be the gaming lineup, also EK Aluminum cooled VGA cards and a very dandy Lighting when it is powered up. Obviously on the graphics card side there is lots to show from the new Radeon range as well as a nice variety of GeForce GTX graphics cards. Graphics card wise you'll spot the new Gaming X and Z cards from MSI (Z versions have the highest clocks / RGB and backplate), and if you look closely at the photos you will notice some new GeForce GTX  1080 Ti models as well.  Indeed, that is the 1080 Ti Lightning. It has been a while since MSI released one (980 Ti). We actually know about the new 1080 Ti lightning for a while now, as hey we design MSI AfterBurner. The new Lightning gets its new looks and this round will come with quad-voltage options. I also was able to get snag some photos of the latest Sea Hawk iteration as well as the EK water-block based one. Also the Armor series is on display which are the more budget friendly.

Certainly not as they will be releasing an 18-core Skylake-X CPU, you better grab your life-savings in money. The processor would be called the Core i9-7980XE. So that brings Skylake-X processor on 6-core, 8-core, 10-core, 12-core, 14-core, 16-core and 18-core models. Really, the 12-core and higher models are not expected to launch with X299 next month maybe even August as intel is not yet ready for mass volume sales. The slides demo X299 support, quad channel DDR4 2666 MHz memory, a new version of Intel Turbo Boost 3.0 technology plus a different cache structure opposed towards Haswell-E and Broadwell-E series. I stated it before, there's a bit of a panic reaction from Intel towards Ryzen 16-core parts, hence the 18-core models seem just that, a reaction to offer something more opposed to AMD Threadripper. These are HUGE steps for Intel, something we have not seen in years. Yep, they are bringing in the big guns. Mind you that these are leaked slides and as such still are to be considered a rumor and unconfirmed.   Archtecture Cores/ Threads L3 Cache PCIe Lanes Base Clock Boost 2.0 Boost 3.0 Launch i9 7980XE Skylake-X 18/36 - - - - - - i9 7960X Skylake-X 16/32 - - - - - - i9 7940X Skylake-X 14/24 - - - - - - i9 7920X Skylake-X 12/24 16.5MB 44 - - - August i9 7900X Skylake-X 10/20 13.75MB 44 3.3GHz 4.3GHz 4.5GHz June i9 7820X Skylake-X 8/16 11MB 28 3.6GHz 4.3GHz 4.5GHz June i9 7800X Skylake-X 6/12 8.25MB 28 3.5GHz 4.0GHz - June i7 7740K Kaby  Lake-X 4/8 8MB 16 4.3GHz 4.5GHz - June i7 7640K Kaby  Lake-X 4/4 8MB 16 4.0GHz 4.2Ghz - June     Source: Videocardz and OC3D Tagged as: Computex 2017 Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

AMD has quite clearly shaken Intel pretty vigorously with Ryzen/TR.

True - Intel is reacting to AMD's new CPUs, but this is not a panic. Intel had years of total domination and as such had little incentives for any huge steps in core count, premformance and price. Now they have a genuine competition, so they react accordingly. I can't see a "panic" in this. If someone expected Intel NOT to react, then they were mistaken.

If you are replying to me, please show me where I used the word 'panic' They moved their release schedule up and added SKUs because there is viable competition, I don't think they are panicking, I think they are reacting 'hastily' which shows that AMDs products are cause for concern, a specter Intel have not had to deal with for some time. I'll be interested to see if Intel adopt a competitive pricing structure or simply try to pretend that they don't have any competition.

I think they will actually have the crown when Threadripper releases, I think it will be a while before the Intel 18 core becomes available. AMD could easily take some binned 32c EPYC processors and release them as 20 or 24 core Threadrippers just to say they have the performance crown (biggest e-peen )-- they could also price them accordingly. Will that even be necessary, I don't know-- if Ryzen 1800x spars nicely with 6950x, Threadripper may do the same even with Intels 18 core. All I know is that anyone with half a brain needs to seriously be applauding (and supporting with their wallets) AMD for this heroic challenge to Intel.

I suspect AMD could release a 32 core chip if they felt like it, just not with all of the bells and whistles (yet). It would stay quad channel memory, due to the motherboards layout.....

As much as i want AMD to be successful for the sake of competition and better prices, i'm affraid Intel will be ahead once again, the core clocks on all those cores is crazy compared to AMD clocks. :/ 4.5GHZ 8 and 10 cores, i guess i did the right thing of not upgrading to Ryzen 1700. The problem however is how AMD will price their CPUs as well as Intel, if Intel is going to keep ripoff people, good luck with that. rsouzadk Newbie Posts: 12 Joined: 2016-09-25 #5437095 Posted on: 05/29/2017 04:09 PM If the i9 7800/20X are priced affordably, they will win the crown. But i really do expect AMD TR to come and to be price unbeatable with all the 44 pcie lanes. I am not expecting performance better on ipc though. That core frequencies on intel 8 cores are insane.

The amount of cores in these numbers probably wont bring the performance crown. Most stuff run on 1 core anyway, multi-core support being optimized for 2 or 4 cores in games. So the performance of a single core (or small bunch of cores) is going to award the performance crown for quite some time.

People said the same about Dual Cores, from this point onward, Devs will take advantage of more cores due to the simple reason that they're becoming more common. Intel will also now release more than just 4 cores for the mid-high end range market, whereas more was only available for Enthusiast market and extremely expensive. The only reason Devs won't optimize for 8+ cores if the Engine they're using just doesn't support it. As for Encoding, Image/Video Editing, Rendering etc All these cores are very good. Even MMOs that are famous for not using more than one thread properly are already using various threads, it's just a matter of time before 8 cores becomes the mainstream, and the amount of time it will take will depend on how manufacturers price their 8+ cores. Not to mention that even a 7700k (stock) might be close or even Bottleneck next gen GPUs like Volta or SLI on it. Even if a 5GHZ 7700k would fix that, 5Ghz is out of reach for a lot of 7700k owners anyway.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

News & Analysis Nvidia Pitching AI to ODMs in Taiwan Junko Yoshida 5/30/2017 00:30 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet MADISON, Wis. – In the not-so-distant past, Computex Taipei, an international computer expo, was all about PCs. Taiwan’s original design manufacturers (ODMs) grew up with Computex and put Taiwan on the map as a global PC hub. Companies that profited from the Taiwan ODMs’ success were Intel and Microsoft, who played key roles in defining PC technology. Fast forward to 2017.  This week, Nvidia is coming to Computex, in hopes of replicating what Intel and Microsoft achieved a few decades ago with the PC market. Nvidia’s sole focus is domination in the new era of “accelerated computing." Nvidia defines accelerated computing as the increased use of a graphics processing unit together with a CPU to accelerate deep learning, analytics and engineering applications. On Monday (May 29), Nvidia unveiled "a partnership program with the world’s leading ODMs -- Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta and Wistron -- to more rapidly meet the demands for AI cloud computing.”  Through a partner program built around Nvidia’s hyperscale GPU accelerator for AI and cloud computing, Nvidia hopes to provide each ODM with “early access to the Nvidia HGX reference architecture, Nvidia's GPU computing technologies and design guidelines,” according to the company. The GPU giant's move on the partnership program with Taiwanese ODMs isn’t about winning a server market. Taiwan already builds all the servers in the world, thanks to companies including Intel and Google who have worked with Taiwanese ODMs for years.  Nvidia wants to push its GPU-compute chassis further into data centers and cloud computing servers that Taiwanese ODMs are already making. GPU-accelerated computing offloads compute-intensive parts of the application to the GPU, while the rest of the code runs on the CPU. Nvidia's goal is to enable accelerated computing “everywhere” from labs to academia and small and medium businesses, explained Keith Morris, senior director of product management for Accelerated Computing at Nvidia. This will help “democratize” the use of such applications as deep learning, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, which rely on rapid acceleration of parallel codes, he added.  Competitive landscape A number of companies have been wooing Taiwanese ODMs for years, said Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. “Intel has been working with most of these server ODMs (Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta and Wistron) for years -- they are the leading cloud server ODMs because of their relationship with Intel,” he noted.

Back in the days, Intel had the upper hand with its more stable and lower TDP offerings. However, in recent months, the tables have turned in favor of AMD with the release of the Risen series of processors. Now Intel is rumored to unveil its offering that will go head to head with AMD’s Threadripper HEDT processors. Many would know by now that AMD will be releasing a high-end desktop processor with as much as 16 cores per package. The AMD Threadripper are to be offered in various flavours and will compete directly with Intel’s line of HEDT chips. As a form of retaliation, Intel is upping the ante by having more cores per package on its line of high-end processors. The newest leak from Videocardz, revealed that Intel is working on providing as much as 18 cores per die for its HEDT line of processors. Intel X-Series Core i9 processor presentation slide (via videocardz.com) The Intel core i9-7980XE will be the crowned jewel of the series sporting as much as 18 cores; with hyper threading enabled, this core count ramps up to 36 per chip. In addition to an impressive core count, the newest line of processors will also feature four channels of DDR4 memory. These DDR4 modules will run at the speed of 2666MHz. On top of this, the new family of high-end chip will also include Intel’s Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. Unfortunately, the price is still unknown at the moment but consumers can expect them to be announced sometime in July or August. However, the range of TDP will be from 140W to 165W across the entire line. Furthermore, the processors will also be house in the LGA2066 socket as with the current Intel HEDT processor. There will be a total of nine processors in the lineup; seven will be made under Skylake-X while the remaining two under the newer Kaby Lake-X architecture. All processors are based on the 14nm process technology and will be compatible with the new X299 motherboard chipset. For more updates on the core i9 processors, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

At the time, it may be understandable to reckon that Richardson’s claims were at best perfunctory, and in an age where Hot Spots and third umpires assist the sport, ICC and Intel need not work their socks off in hunt of mere bonus tech.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

The chipmaker, which has stood unchallenged atop the performance desktop mountain for years, is reportedly working on a potent lineup for its X299 platform that includes an 18-core monster. Update: And they are official! Check out Intel's confirmed Core-X and Core i9 lineup here. According to VideoCardz, which says its intelligence was obtained from multiple sources, the Intel Core i9-7980XE will be the new performance king with 18 cores and 36 threads (other details like L3 cache size and clock speeds wasn't shared). There’s also said to be a Core i9-7960X with 16 cores / 32 threads and a Core i9-7940X with 14 cores and 28 threads in addition to the stable of chips we’ve previously heard about. Intel even reportedly has new boxes in the works as spied above. As we learned earlier this month, AMD is also gearing up for an epic battle this summer with its Ryzen 9 “Threadripper” chips. That lineup, if you recall, is said to be capped by the Ryzen 9 1998X, a 16-core / 32-thread beast with a base clock of 3.5GHz (Boost to 3.9GHz), quad-channel DDR4 support and access to 44 PCIe lanes. That chip, along with the 1998, will carry a 155W TDP, rumors indicate. Some expect Intel to announce its new X299 platform as early as next month although as always, rumors of this nature should be taken with a grain of salt until we hear official word from the horse’s mouth.

Viewed by many as the spiritual successor to its Compute Stick, the Compute Card is a full-blown computer crammed into a card-like form factor that’s roughly as thick as a few credit cards. The idea is that, instead of having to replace an entire PC or IoT device when it comes time to upgrade, one can just swap out the Compute Card with a new model containing faster hardware. Despite their small footprint, Intel said its Compute Cards would pack plenty of processing power upon their arrival in mid-2017. As we approach that promised launch window, we’re now hearing rumors regarding specific Compute Card hardware that corroborates Intel’s claims. CNX-Software recently published a handful of block diagrams and specs for four Compute Card models – two with Apollo Lake processors and two with Kaby Lake chips. The Apollo Lake models are said to include the CD1C64GK with an Intel Celeron N3450 quad-core chip, 4GB of DDR3 and 64GB of eMMC flash and the CD1P64GK which packs a quad-core Pentium N4200 as well as 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC. The more powerful Kaby Lake models mentioned include the CD1M3128MK with a Core m3-7Y30 dual-core CPU, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of PCIe storage and the CD1IV128MK that features a Core i5-7Y57 dual-core with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of PCIe storage. No word yet on pricing or a solid launch date.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Kate Burleigh has led the Australian and New Zealand businesses, having made the shift from sales and marketing roles. Jerry Tsao, VP of Intel's Sales & Marketing Group and GM of Regional Sales for the Asia Pacific and Japan region said "Kate brought a new energy and creativity to the Managing Director role in Australia and New Zealand. Under her leadership, Intel's impact extended well beyond our traditional customer base and channels". In previous roles in PR and sales, Burleigh told Tech Republic that she didn't notice a gender imbalance. But when she started looking for enterprise sales roles she found she needed to justify herself. In that interview, Burleigh said "It wasn't that it was harder, but I had to have that second or third conversation that I really was serious and I seriously wanted it, because were a few question marks over could you really do it, and I could never say it was because I was female, or was it because my skills were [such that] I was identified more strongly as a consumer marketer". Burleigh finishes up on June 30 with a replacement to be announced "in due course" according to Tsao.

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Intel Intel’s new Core i9 sounds like a monster Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 29th, 2017 at 2:53 PM Share Tweet It’s been a long time since Intel came out with a new line of CPUs. Although the company updates its processor lineup every year like clockwork, the product categories remain the same: Core i3 for budget PCs, Core i5 for most people, and Core i7 for those mystical “power users.” But starting this year, the dial goes up to 9. A previous rumor had suggested that Intel will be debuting a Core i9 lineup this month. Now a new leaked specs sheet has details: there will be multiple Core i9 models, topping out with a disturbingly powerful 18-core version. Don't Miss: New leaks show the iPhone 8 design we’re hoping for Videocardz got their hands on a bunch of information about the upcoming Core i9 lineup, including all the models and the roadmap for the release date. The Core i9 appears to be the spearhead for a new wave of powerful Intel processors, named the Core X series. The X series will come in Core i5, Core i7 and Core i9 versions, going from 8 to 18 cores. The headline is the Core i9-7980XE, an 18-core monster that should comfortably be the fastest consumer chip on the market when it launches. It has a TPU of 165 Watts, which is a lot compared to Intel’s other CPUs. But the high power draw should mean plenty of speed with overclocking, which is fully supported on the chip. Further down the card, we have versions of the Core i9 with 16, 14, 12 and 10 cores. Those are likely to be much cheaper, and more attractive for the gaming and video production crowd. The new lineup isn’t so much a big leap forward technically as it is a big middle finger to AMD, Intel’s only competition in the PC market. AMD recently released a lineup of well-received Ryzen chips that challenged Intel seriously for the first time in years, and the roadmap has a new line of “Threadripper” processors, designed for serious parallel processing, coming soon.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Intel’s new Core i9 Skylake-X lineup said to feature 18C/36T and 16C/32T CPUs Intel’s new Core i9 Skylake-X lineup said to feature 18C/36T and 16C/32T CPUs Matthew Wilson 6 days ago CPU Update 2: Intel’s new Core-X CPU family has been made official. Intel made the announcement at Computex this morning, going into detail on the X299 platform and the benefits these new CPUs bring. You can read our report on that, HERE.  Update: A few weeks back, we first caught wind of Intel’s plans for Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X in the form of new Core i9 and Core i7 CPUs. At the time, it was believed that the highest end CPU in the lineup would be the Core i9 7920X with 12 cores and 24 threads. However, since then, it appears that two more Core i9 CPUs have come to light, one with 16 cores and 32 threads and another with 18 cores and 36 threads. This news comes just a week after AMD officially announced its upcoming Threadripper 16C/32T CPU for its upcoming HEDT platform. According to an exclusive report on Videocardz, the Core i9 7980XE will be Intel’s flagship chip for Skylake-X, with 18C/36T. Meanwhile the Core i9 7960X will be a 16C/32T chip. Unfortunately, clock speeds and other features are not currently listed. Here is a leaked presentation slide courtesy of Videocardz: Original Story: We have been hearing rumours surrounding Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs from Intel for months now. However, the picture remained unclear and somewhat confusing to follow. Fortunately, some new information has now come to light, indicating that Skylake-X will arrive as a batch of HEDT Core i9 processors later this year, while Kaby Lake-X will carry the Core i7 name. Up to this point, Intel’s Core i7 branding has carried across a broad range of CPUs, blurring the line between mainstream chips like the 6700K and HEDT parts like the 6900K. According to a leak over on the Anandtech forum, this will be changing this year, with the introduction of the Core i9 series. This new lineup will contain Intel’s upcoming Skylake-X CPUs, ranging from the 6C/12T Core i9 7800X up to the 12C/24T Core i9 7820X. For the mainstream, Intel will be launching two new Core i7 CPUs, the Core i7-7740K and the Core i7-7640K Here is a list of each of the rumoured CPUs and the details we have on them so far: Processor Cores/Threads L3 Cache PCIe Lanes Base Clock Turbo Clock 2.0 Turbo Clock 3.0 Launch  Core i9-7920X  12C/24T  16.5MB  44  TBD  TBD TBD August  Core i9-7900X  10C/20T  13.75MB  44  3.3GHz  4.3GHz 4.5GHz June  Core i9-7820X  8C/16T  11MB  28  3.6GHz  4.3GHz 4.5GHz June  Core i9-7800X  6C/12T  8.25MB  28  3.5GHz  4.0GHz N/A June  Core i7-7740K  4C/8T  8MB  16  4.3GHz  4.5GHz N/A June  Core i7-7640K  4C/4T  6MB  16  4.0GHz  4.2GHz N/A June This is a good start to clearing up the confusion surrounding Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X. Though I do think the Kaby Lake-X name is still a tad confusing, given that one of these CPUs is a cut down 7700K, while the other is a slightly improved one. With that in mind, now is as good a time as any to remind everyone that these are still rumours. While this particular leak seems promising, we have no way of verifying its legitimacy. KitGuru Says: This is certainly the most promising leak we have seen so far but so far, the claims are unverified. That said, we don’t have long to wait to get the full story, with Computex kicking off in two weeks time, coupled with Intel’s appearance at E3.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags core i7 Core i9 Intel leak news Skylake-X Previous 10% of KitGuru gamers play at 4k/5k resolution Next Square Enix brings Final Fantasy VII Remake development in-house, Lightning Returns director is a project lead Check Also Computex: AMD RX Vega Consumer Launch July 2017, Threadripper Summer 2017 At its press conference in Taipei, AMD has announced that the RX Vega consumer GPU … Rocky40 “Core i7-7640K 4C/4T 6MB 16 4.0GHz 4.2GHz N/A June” Now that’s some funny stuff right there branding a i5 a i7 like wow Intel now I have seen everything. Then again they do the same thing on the mobile make a i3 a i5 or worse a i7 with dual core 2/4 and people think oh look a i7 it’s the best I will buy it. This is really sad & this is what happens when there is very little competition in a market. I would have thought with AMD’s Ryzen being out there now that Intel would stop trying to pull the wool over peoples eye’s. But then again this rushed kaby-lake X stuff seems like a direct response to the Ryzen because Intel knows kaby-lake has enough core mhz speed to do great in games that are out now and is hedging their bets to make sure AMD does not over take them on the 2066 socket in the games. I am not a AMD fanboy I don’t own any AMD CPU’s at all just 4 Graphics cards from them. I do know my next CPU will be AMD once Ryzen 2 comes out as I am tired of these little Intel games they like to play. Danilo Bojic I wonder how many thousands of dollars they’re gonna price this at CnM So basically you paired your intel processor with an AMD graphics card? Don’t pretend to be Mr. Knowitall if you can’t build a proper rig. Weston Konik I estimate it at possibly $2,500 Rocky40 LOL What does pairing a AMD Graphics card with a Intel CPU have to do with anything? I happen to like both companies each has their own great products. I also like Nvidia graphics cards but this time around I chose to go AMD graphics card next time who knows. My system is fast enough and plays the games just fine. Владан Аранђеловић I think its misstype. i5-7640k from 7600. Cos i7-7740k is from 7700. So basically high and k version gets revision.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 18 Intel Core-X CPU series to include 18-core flagship says leaked slide by Mark Tyson on 29 May 2017, 15:31 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadhzt Add to My Vault: A couple of weeks back we saw a 'leaked Powerpoint presentation' that indicated Intel was readying its first ever Core i9-Series processors. These processors would sport as many as 12 physical cores, and up to 24 threads via Hyperthreading. A table showed that the Core i9-7920X was the top-end Skylake-X processor and it was asserted by the source that we would see many of this processor range launched in June. Fast forward to last Thursday and a SiSoft Sandra benchmark database entry seemed to confirm one of the lower tier Skylake-X processors had been undergoing some testing. The Core i9-7900X appeared to have been 'confirmed', packing 10C/20T but with a TDP of 175W. Intel has Core-X 18, 16, and 14-core options Today, in an exclusive from the leak specialists over at VideoCardz, new slides and info "from multiple sources" assert that Intel's Core X-Series chips will include SKUs with up to 18 cores. In a genuine looking Intel slide you can see above, the first callout box clearly boasts that the upcoming enthusiast processors will offer "More core options: 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, and 4." Other highlighted features of the X-Series include a so-called Rebalanced Intel Smart Cache hierarchy. This will tweak the L1, L2, and L3 cache structure. Intel also trumpets and updated Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, and an integrated memory controller for up to four channels of DDR4 2666. Using new data VideoCardz has put together the table above which adds the 18C/36T Core i9-7980XE at the top of the pile. The site also sourced some gaudy (RGB LED illuminated?) boxes for the upcoming X-Series. Please remember to take these rumours with a pinch of salt. Intel's Computex keynote is scheduled for tomorrow at 2pm Taiwan time (7am here in the UK).

Posted by QuorTek - Mon 29 May 2017 16:42 As I read it, then it is like they are digging into their work station CPUs and rebranding them..sorry if I am paranoid or anything… though if AMD keeps pushing out good stuff now and in the future + good prices.. then will be AMD next time building a system for sure. Not a fanboy of either brand but if offer high quality for a more reasonable amount of money then count me in, and if the difference is like 5% or less give or take performance wise either side then wont notice the difference if buying the top products from either company. Posted by 3dcandy - Mon 29 May 2017 16:43 And you'll need a mortgage to buy one as well ;) Posted by LSG501 - Mon 29 May 2017 16:59 So basically intel are releasing their ‘xeon cpu’s' onto the desktop as i9 then rather than being called xeon like they are now. Now based on current ryzen benchmarks, where ryzen has better multithreading in the apps I use, plus the current cheaper pricing from AMD I see no reason why I would pick an i9 over a thread ripper assuming AMD keeps the prices cheaper….the motherboards will likely be cheaper on AMD side too. The Intel cpu might give me better fps in games but lets be honest if you're going after 8+ cores the odds are you're not after the cpu to play games, it's for heavy cpu workloads like 3D rendering and video editing etc. Posted by Iota - Mon 29 May 2017 18:51 LSG501 The Intel cpu might give me better fps in games but lets be honest if you're going after 8+ cores the odds are you're not after the cpu to play games, it's for heavy cpu workloads like 3D rendering and video editing etc. Even if it was for gaming, the difference in FPS is so slight I'd be more inclined to go with AMD at this stage, purely for the pricing / core count available. Posted by Tabbykatze - Mon 29 May 2017 21:51 Well this all seems rather convenient, AMD announces and releases Ryzen 8/16 which do quite well, AMD leaks a little of an HEDT range, Intel bring out their cut down/across Zeons as the i9 series up to 12/24 but then AMD states they will have up to 16/32 as their flagship then magically Intel has an HEDT processor with 18/36. AMD need to keep this up and see how long the stored up ammo that Intel has stagnating is used up and we see the real battle starting :P SEE NEWER » MY HEXUS Sign in for the best HEXUS experience LOG IN REGISTER HEXUS NEWSLETTER MOST VIEWED MOST COMMENTED 1 Intel Core i9-7900X breaks several benchmark world records 47 2 Intel Core-X CPU series to include 18-core flagship says leaked slide 18 3 AMD Ryzen 5 1400 and Ryzen 5 1600 (14nm) 13 4 Intel introduces its Core-X Series processors at Computex 17 5 The Cryorig Taku desktop ITX chassis has hit Kickstarter 7 1 QOTW: Which graphics card is in your PC? 92 2 Intel Core i9-7900X breaks several benchmark world records 47 3 AMD is preparing nine Threadripper CPUs for launch 22 4 Intel Core-X CPU series to include 18-core flagship says leaked slide 18 5 Intel introduces its Core-X Series processors at Computex 17 EVENTS ALL EVENTS POLL FACEBOOK INDUSTRY PRESS RELEASES 1 TUNAI CLIP Bluetooth Music Receiver and Wireless Headphone Amplifier Wins Computex d&i Award 2 Synology® Debuts an Array of Cutting-Edge Products and Advanced Applications during Computex 3 Thermaltake New Riing Plus LED RGB Radiator Fan TT Premium Edition at COMPUTEX Taipei 2017 4 QNAP Releases Qfixes for Samba Writable Share Vulnerability 5 BIOSTAR Holds Successful Showcase at COMPUTEX 2017 6 COLORFUL at COMPUTEX: Black Tech is Here INFORMATION About us Advertise Contact us How Competitions work How we test About Cookies What our awards mean Privacy and terms of use SUBSCRIPTIONS RSS / Alerts / Twitter Facebook / Newsletter Unsubscribe HEXUS Community Members: 412,187 Forum posts: 2,579,074 Forum threads: 248,350 Currently active users: 477 Copyright © 1998 - 2017, HEXUS.net.

The powerhouse notebooks and convertibles are characterised by high-performance internals. ASUS unveiled all of its new products at its press event at Computex 2017. There are three new additions to its flagship ZenBook brand and a further two VivoBook models. The overarching focus is on professional customers who are looking for a premium product. ZenBook Pro Headlining the announcements is the new ZenBook Pro, purportedly the "thinnest, lightest and most powerful" version to date. It comes with a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake Core i7 processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB SSD. An NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 Ti graphics card provides ample power for on-the-go gaming sessions. ASUS ZenBook Pro ASUS / Microsoft The laptop's 15.6-inch display has a full 4K Ultra HD resolution. It fits within a package that weighs only 1.8kg and measures up at 18.9mm thick. Despite the 4K display and plentiful processing power, ASUS is quoting a battery life of up to 14 hours. The ZenBook Pro will launch later this summer priced from $1,299. ZenBook 3 Deluxe With a similar target audience to the Pro, the ZenBook 3 Deluxe is a smaller 14-inch device that weights 1.1kg and has a 12.9mm thick chassis. ASUS' NanoEdge bezel-less display technology makes the laptop's overall footprint only marginally larger than that of a 13-inch device. Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe ASUS / Microsoft Internally, there's an Intel Core i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage. In a decision that will please forward-thinking buyers, ASUS has included two USB Type-C ports as connectivity options. It will help to futureproof the laptop as USB-C starts to gain widespread adoption. Availability will start this summer priced at $1,199. ZenBook Flip S The ZenBook Flip S is a convertible laptop that can be used as a tablet while on the go. It has a 4K Ultra HD display, an Intel Core i7 processor and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. ASUS claims the device is the world's thinnest convertible laptop at just 10.9mm thick. ASUS ZenBook Flip S ASUS / Microsoft The Flip S will support an active stylus for use with Windows Ink. It also joins the other new members of the ZenBook family in offering a built-in fingerprint sensor for secure biometric authentication with Windows Hello. Pricing starts at $1,099 with sales again commencing this summer. VivoBook Pro 15 & VivoBook S15 ASUS has also upgraded its VivoBook collection of mid-range laptops with two new options. The Pro 15 is a 15.6-inch version with an Intel Core i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM, a hybrid storage system and a 4K display. It includes a fingerprint sensor, twin stereo speakers and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card for gaming. ASUS VivoBook Pro 15 ASUS / Microsoft The VivoBook S15 sports a 15.6-inch screen too. It has a Core i7 underneath, although it's a slower i7-7500U compared to the Pro's i7-7700HQ. The graphics hardware is swapped out for an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX and the wealth of accompanying features present on the Pro have been dropped in favour of a lower price. The Pro 15 will start at $799. The S15 is significantly less at $499, allowing it to cross over towards the lower end of the market. In line with the other devices announced today, both will launch in the next few months. "The edge of beyond" Abstract marketing taglines aside, ASUS' new ZenBooks and VivoBooks affirm its presence as one of the leading premium laptop brands. The revised range comprises several notable strengths, including ASUS' signature refined metal design of the past few years and new breakthroughs in overall footprint reduction. ASUS VivoBook S15 ASUS / Microsoft "Today is all about our relentless effort in striving toward perfection," said ASUS chairman Jonney Shih. "Our brand-new ZenBook and VivoBook line-up truly goes to the edge of beyond, providing everyone with a new definition of thin, beautiful and powerful laptops." Alongside the laptops, ASUS has also unveiled a pair of new Windows 10 all-in-one computers, a flagship 27-inch QHD design-focused monitor and a unique new Wi-Fi router built with Intel technology.

But that doesn’t mean people don’t want it, as Eve-Tech CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis will tell you. And he should know — his startup’s new convertible computer, the Eve V, had its spec sheet determined by the votes of thousands of crowdfunding backers. What does the resulting product look like? Well, it’s pretty much a Surface Pro with two USB-C ports. You were saying, Microsoft? But Microsoft is just fine with the Eve V. In fact, it’s impressed — it’s going to be showing off the product this week in its booth and at its keynote at Computex Taipei, according to Karatsevidis. Intel is another heavy hitter backing the Eve V, having invested a “six-figure” sum in its development. There’s something going on with the Eve V beyond your average Indiegogo vaporware. Other specs apparently decided upon by committee are a slightly thicker chassis than the Surface Pro to allow for a bigger battery, and Intel Core i5 or i7 Y-series processors — that’s the low-power line that used to be called Core M before Intel confusingly rebranded it. Karatsevidis claims that the Eve V’s cooling system allows the processor to run at top speed for longer, and the selection of chips allowed for a fanless design. There aren’t any obvious red flags Performance and battery life assessments will have to wait for a full review, of course. But what I can say about the Eve V after spending a little time with it is that there aren’t any obvious red flags in its design, apart from a backspace button that’s inexplicably labeled “oops!” The build quality is solid, with subtle rounded edges that make it feel friendlier than a Surface Pro. There is almost no branding beyond a light pattern underneath the kickstand and a triangle logo on the V key. The design is obviously derivative, but it’s a good-looking machine for what it is. The 3:2 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 screen appears to be a very similar panel to the Surface Pro’s, though the glass has had an extra anti-reflective coating applied. The pen, meanwhile, is literally identical to the Surface Pro 2, 3, and 4’s — it comes from the same supplier and is backwards compatible. The keyboard has RGB backlighting and a surprising amount of travel, and there’s a Precision Trackpad that felt reasonably good. The power button has a fingerprint sensor. And yes, there are two USB-C ports — one with Thunderbolt 3 — as well as two regular USB-A ports. And a headphone jack with a dedicated amplifier. All of this starts at $799 including the keyboard and pen. The Surface Pro also starts at $799, but that’s for a model with half the RAM (just 4GB) and without a bundled keyboard or pen. On paper, the Eve V looks like a very well balanced machine for the price. But there is a catch The catch is that it’s going to be produced in limited quantities, so you might have trouble actually buying one even if it does turn out to be great. Eve-Tech is a small company that seems to be taking inspiration from OnePlus’ early success stoking fan enthusiasm with direct online sales in batches. It’s going to be shipping the first Eve V units out to Indiegogo backers in a matter of weeks, however, so it shouldn’t be too long before we know whether this really is a product worth buzzing about.

Starting at $799, the 15-inch brushed aluminum laptop comes with an Intel quad-core processor, and NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics, with an optional 4K display. Of the information Asus has released so far, the company has released the base price, but not the prices of the higher-end configurations. At the $799 base model will include an Intel Core-i5 7300HQ CPU, 500 GB HDD, and a 1080p display. Meanwhile the high-end model will have a Core-i7 7700HQ, 4K full sRGB screen, NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics, 16GB of RAM, and both a 512GB PCIe SSD and a 2TB hard drive. Asus will also be including Intel’s Optane Memory for faster storage performance (though it’s not clear if this is just for HDD models or all models). Asus VivoBook 15 N580 Processor Intel Core i5-7300HQ (4C/4T, 2.5-3.5GHz, 6MB L3, 14nm, 45w) Intel Core i7-7700HQ (4C/8T, 2.8-3.8GHz, 6MB L3, 14nm, 45w) Memory Up To 16 GB (2x SO-DIMM) Graphics Intel Core Intel HD Graphics 630 (24 EUs) (Optional) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (640 CUDA Cores) Displays 15.6" 1080p (Optional) 15.6" 1080p, 178° Viewing Angle (Optional) 15.6" 1080p, 100% sRGB, 178° Viewing Angle (Optional) 15.6" 4K, 100% sRGB, 178° Viewing Angle Storage HDD: 500 GB, 1 TB, 2TB SSD (SATA): 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB Networking 802.11ac, 2x2:2, 866Mpbs Max, 2.4 and 5GHz Bluetooth 4.2 Audio Stereo Speakers (Harman Kardon Certified) Battery 47 Whr Right Side 2x USB 2.0 Type-A Headset Jack SD Card Reader Kensington Lock Left Side USB 3.0 Type-A USB 3.0 Type-C (w/DP Support) RJ45 Slim Port HDM Dimensions 380 x 256 x 19.2 mm Weight Non-Touch: 1.99kg Touch: 2.29kg Pricing $799 USD and up Considering its plethora of high-end components, the VivoBook Pro's 4.85-pound weight and 0.75-inch thickness are quite reasonable. The VivoBook Pro uses a dual-fan system to keep its powerful components from getting too hot. During a brief hands-on, the laptop felt solid and sturdy in my hands and its metal deck was pleasantly cool to the touch. The VivoBook's backlight keyboard felt sturdy snappy under my fingers and didn't even have a hint of flex. Its buttonless touchpad had just the right amount of friction and resistance for each click. Asus claims that the optional 4K screen on the VivoBook covers an impressive 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut. In my brief time with the laptop, it was difficult to tell how vibrant the colors were as the background and icons the company displayed were rather bland. The VivoBook Pro doesn't skimp on ports. Its left side contains an Ethernet port, a USB 3.0 connector, HDMI out and a USB Type-C port. The right side houses two more USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader and a 3.5mm audio jack. It's a shame that Asus didn't put a Thunderbolt 3 port on this laptop, but that would have likely added to the cost. Asus hasn't announced a release date for the VivoBook Pro. However, depending on just what the base configuration is like and how much the higher-end models cost, this laptop could be a great buy for design students or anyone that needs to do creative work, without breaking the bank.

(Optional) 15.6" 1080p, 178° Viewing Angle Can I take that to mean that the base model will have a TN panel? Reply lazarpandar - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link That's what I took it to mean. Reply peevee - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link Still the huge awful bezels like it is 1999. The laptop is so big because of them, you could literally fit 17" screen instead of 15". Reply rocky12345 - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link LOL a bit picky but it is ok to have a preference. Just be thankful it don't got a glossy bezels like so many laptops had in the past and some still do or have flashing LEDS around the bezels...lol Reply Freakie - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link The bezel is fine by me, gives them room for that number pad. Too few 15" laptops have number pads. Reply ciuvak - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link 2x USB 2.0 Type-A seriously? Why would anyone need even one 2.0 port in 2017? Reply rocky12345 - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link I was wondering the same thing why not just have all the USB ports 3.0 or 3.1 makes a lot more sense in 2017.

Both new Acer Switch 2-in-1 notebooks can be used with an Acer Active Pen on the touch screen to sketch, take notes or annotate documents or photos with Windows Ink. The Acer Switch 5 builds on the industry-leading innovations of its predecessor, the Acer Switch Alpha 12, providing a fanless, quiet experience through Acer LiquidLoop cooling, and excellent performance with up to 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processors. Acer’s patented auto-retracting kickstand allows for easy one-handed adjustments to the viewing angle. It also supports Windows Hello with a fingerprint reader for fast and secure access. The Acer Switch 3 features a 2-in-1 design that is well-balanced with a large 12.2-inch display, Intel processors and a quiet, fanless design. “Customers have embraced the flexibility of 2-in-1 designs to help them get more done throughout the day in both notebook or tablet modes,” said James Lin, General Manger, Commercial & Detachable Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. “Acer’s Switch line is now able to reach more customers, whether they are looking for something that provides the latest in performance and features, or if they need a more accessible option for studies, work and play.” The Switch 5 is Acer’s first 2-in-1 to be offered with 7th Generation Intel Core i7 and i5 processors to deliver the top-rated performance needed for serious tasks, presentations and entertainment on the go. The built-in fingerprint reader on the power button authenticates users and provides quick access to their projects. Users can be assured their information will remain secure and private when using the fingerprint reader for logging on thanks to Windows Hello. With Acer’s patented auto-retracting kickstand, the Switch 5’s viewing angle can be easily adjusted one-handedly, providing added convenience in any scenario. Also, the Switch 5 uses Acer’s proprietary fanless LiquidLoop cooling system to keep it running efficiently without fan noise, making it ideal for shared spaces such as meetings and open offices. Plus, the LiquidLoop Cooling System doesn’t require venting that can compromise reliability due to airflow issues and dust accumulation. The fanless design supports powerful 7th Generation Intel Core processors to deliver excellent performance and day-to-night 10.5-hour battery life. The Switch 5 has a vibrant 12-inch wide-view FHD+ touch display with IPS technology, an impressive 2160 x 1440 resolution and support from Intel HD Graphics 620.

The device runs on Intel Pentium and Celeron processors that deliver solid every day performance and up to 8 hours of battery life. The 12.2-inch display is designed to deliver incredible precision and a responsive 10-point touch experience. It has a wide 178-degree viewing angle and 1920x1200 FHD resolution with IPS technology. The front-facing speakers complement the stunning visuals with enhanced volume and quality for rich, expressive tones. The sleek metallic top cover has a distinctive yet subtle design with complementary etched edging. Slim, lightweight The Switch 5 and Switch 3 are available with ample storage and memory options. The Switch 5 supports a 256GB or 512GB PCIe SSD and up to 8GB of LPDDR3 SDRAM. The Switch 3 supports 32GB, 64GB or 128GB eMMC memory and up to 4GB of LPDDR3 SDRAM. Both models can access additional files through the MicroSDXC slot.

According to a leak over at VideoCardz, the upcoming Intel Core i9 X-Series processor family for the Intel X299 platform are going to be monsters with high core counts, up to 44 lanes of PCIe off the CPU and updated Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. The flagship part will be the Intel Core i9-7980XE with 18-cores and 36-threads, but clock speeds, pricing and launch date are all unknown. It looks like the TDP on the Intel Skylake-X processors will be up to 165W TDP, which is actually pretty impressive for an 18-core processor. Intel will also be offering Kaby Lake-X processors for this platform according to the leaked information, so that means the Intel X299 platform will support your source of 4 to 18 processing cores!

Coach Well, like most folks have been saying. Regardless of your team, red or blue or neither, the competition is helping. Without Ryzen, we would have seen more “status quo” from Intel with the usual up-tick, or is it up-tock? 😉 This is good news for the industry and consumers. Moore’s Law has become difficult to continue, yet if no one is pushing the chip-maker(s), then of course, the Law will fail to hold true. Coach I can’t wait for the benchmark battles between the Threadrippers and i-9’s. 🙂 Six_Tymes yep, and coffee lake with the newer chipset is what i have been waiting for, and its coming sooner thanks to what you said. yes!!! clip art The flagship part will be the Intel Core i9-7980XE with 18-cores and 36-threads, but clock speeds, pricing and launch date are all unknown.

Reception has been mixed, ranging from “this should have been called the Surface Pro 5” to “meh”. Fortunately, Microsoft’s “tablet that can replace your laptop” is no longer the only game in town. In fact, there’s quite a few of them right now. We take a long at some of the most recent and most enticing 2-in-1 options so far this year to see which one might be the best for your mobile Windows 10 needs. The New Microsoft Surface Pro Let’s start with the “granddaddy” of Windows 2-in-1s, at least as far as the new trend goes. The new, numberless Surface Pro is as mixed as the opinions about it. While Microsoft itself almost downplays the new device, this latest gen Surface Pro almost has enough new features to make upgrading from a Surface Pro 4 almost worth it. At the same time, it lacks the punch of a totally new flagship, leaving fans and prospective buyers quite conflicted. There is a lot going for the new Surface Pro. Its top configuration definitely blows away most of the competition. The 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity on the N-Trig Surface Pen threatens to dethrone Wacom at what it does best. The thinner and, at least promised, cooler body makes for a worry-free portable workstation. And it promises an almost unbelievable 13.5 hours of battery life, which will probably be the most debunked claim. There are, however, areas where it failed or flat out refused to move forward. The screen hasn’t changed one bit, be it in size or pixel density. And Microsoft hasn’t budged on the issue of USB-A versus USB-C. But perhaps most disappointing is that, for all its power, the Surface Pen is no longer included in the price tag, effectively increasing the New Surface Pro’s TCO. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core m3/i5/i7 • RAM: 4/8/16 GB • Storage: 128/256/512 GB/1 TB SSD • Display: 12.3-inch 2736×1824 PixelSense • USB: 1 x USB 3.0 • Battery: 13.5 hrs • Pen: Yes, N-Trig (Separate) • Keyboard: Yes (Separate) • Dimensions: 292 x 201 x 8.5 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 768/770/784 g (tablet only) • Price: $799 to $2,699 Samsung Galaxy Book 10.6 It might be unfair to have two Samsung tablets in this list, but the two models are so different to warrant it. Aside from subtle external differences, the insides are also different enough that you could almost compare this to the dichotomy between a Pro and non-Pro model of the Microsoft Surface. The 10.6-inch Galaxy Book is arguably the smallest and lightest of the bunch. While Huawei does have something that is claimed to be lighter, the overall smaller surface area of the Galaxy Book lends itself easier to hold, especially with one hand. Plus, it’s easier to cram inside a smaller bag than any 12-inch slab. Digital artists and scribblers definitely won’t mind having a highly portable drawing pad or notebook, especially one powered by Wacom. The size does come at a price. Though not exactly the weakest, the Galaxy Book 10.6 pales in comparison with its larger contemporaries. Fortunately, it does run on the latest Intel Core m3, so you are at least guaranteed some fanless performance. The bottleneck, however, will be the 4 GB of RAM and most especially the 128 GB of eMMC storage. For light computing uses, that’s not going to be a problem, but do remember this is Windows we’re talking about. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core m3 • RAM: 4 GB • Storage: 128 GB eMMC • Display: 10.6-inch 1920×1080 LCD TFT • USB: 1 x USB-C • Battery: 4,000 mAh • Pen: Yes, Wacom (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 261.2 x 179.1 x 8.9 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 650 g (tablet only) • Price: $729.99 Samsung Galaxy Book 12 Admittedly, the Galaxy Book 10.6 almost seems like an afterthought that it’s puzzling Samsung even put one out at all. It is lavishing all of its marketing attention on the larger 12-inch model and understandably so, considering it is the more powerful of the two. More, of course, doesn’t mean most. In the grand scheme of things, it does barely cut it. There are a few available configurations, depending on whether you want LTE connectivity to go with your tablet. But at most you will be given a 7th gen Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of SSD storage. If you opt for LTE, you only get half of that. And while Samsung fortunately does throw in the essential pen and keyboard in the package, the keyboard folio cover’s stability leaves much to be desired. There are, of course, some things going for the Galaxy Book, aside from bundling the important accessories. Samsung’s Super AMOLED screen is always praiseworthy, especially when lumped in with a Wacom digitizer. You’ll also be hard-pressed to find a Windows 10 2-in-1 of this size to actually have not just one but two USB-C ports. It’s not the only one anymore, mind, which hopefully hints at a new trend. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core i5 • RAM: 8 GB • Storage: 256 GB SSD • Display: 12-inch 2160×1440 Super AMOLED • USB: 2 x USB-C • Battery: 11 hrs • Pen: Yes, Wacom (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 291.3 x 199.8 x 7.4 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 754 g (tablet and keyboard) • Price: $1,129.99 to $1,329.99 HP Spectre x2 (2017) HP announced the 2017 refresh of the HP Spectre x2 without much fuss or fanfare, lumping it with other new 2017 models of its other product lines. It is, however, perhaps the most underestimated of this group. Calling it a refresh does it no justice, almost mirroring Microsoft’s attitude towards the new Surface Pro. In reality, however, this might as well have been called the Spectre x3. HP has bumped up almost everything without bumping up the size, at least not too much. While still at 12 inches, it now offers a staggering 3000×2000 pixels, higher than even that of the Surface Pro. At its top configuration, it matches that new Microsoft flagship blow for blow: Intel Core i7, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of SSD. But unlike the Surface Pro, it uses USB-C. Two, in fact, just like its predecessor. There is a price to pay for all that power. It’s by far the bulkiest and heaviest of the group. Perhaps not really by much, though HP hasn’t divulged how much the tablet itself weighs. But whereas most of its rivals are trying to cut down on active cooling, the Spectre x2 2017 actually has 2 fans inside. That should help with thermal issues and throttling but does add to the battery drain. The Price for the top tier might also be one of the highest, but that would already include the N-Trig powered pen and keyboard in the box. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core i5/i7 (optional Iris Pro graphics) • RAM: 16 GB • Storage: 1 TB • Display: 12.3-inch 3000×2000 LCD IPS • USB: 2 x USB-C • Battery: 8 hrs • Pen: Yes, N-Trig (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 294 x 207 x 7.7 (tablet only) • Weight: 1,140 kg (tablet and keyboard) • Price: starts at $999 Huawei MateBook E Huawei is a latecomer to the Windows 2-in-1 party, and its first MateBook shows how green it is. Fortunately, it isn’t one to give up after the first try. It has expanded the MateBook brand to three new devices, and the 2-in-1 MateBook E aims to correct much of its predecessor’s flaws, while making some rather big claims for itself. In terms of specs, the MateBook E is more a direct rival of the Samsung Galaxy Book 12 rather than the Surface Pro. It has the same 7th gen Core i5 at its highest, with 8 GB of RAM, and the same 12-inch 2160×1440 screen, albeit not an AMOLED one. Although it only has room for one USB-C port, it does trump the Galaxy Book in some other areas, like having a 512 GB SSD option and a fingerprint sensor on the volume rocker button. The MateBook E’s biggest appeal, however, will be its relatively diminutive size. Huawei boasts of is 6.9 mm profile and 640 g weight. It is, in effect, pitting itself against the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which is slightly larger in size as well as weight. It does, however, raise the question of thermal management, as there is most likely no room for active cooling. If Hauwei managed to pull that off without a hitch, the MateBook will certainly be the lightest and thinnest 2-in-1 so far. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core m3/i5 • RAM: 4/8 GB • Storage: 128/256/512 GB • Display: 12-inch 2160×1440 LCD IPS • USB: 1 x USB-C • Battery: 4,430 mAh • Pen: Yes, Wacom (Separate) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 278.8 x 194.1 x 6.9 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 640 g (tablet only), 1,100 g (tablet and keyboard) • Price: TBA (Estimated $1,455) Chuwi SurBook “Best” might not always mean the same things to everyone. It definitely doesn’t always mean having the top of the line things. It usually means having the best of what your money can buy, and money isn’t always infinite. When you’re willing to cut a few corners but still need something quite usable, then Chuwi’s newly minted SurBook might be worth a look. Sure, it’s not going to win this race in term of performance and more, even against the Galaxy Book 10.6’s Core m3. Running the show is a Celeron N3450 (Atom) and you also have the same 128 GB eMMC. It’s also not the most carry-friendly at nearly a kilo. In other areas, however, it is just as competitive and even better than its rivals. It has 6 GB of RAM, more than what Samsung was willing to put in the lower end Galaxy Book. It boasts of the same screen density as the Surface Pro, with a 12.3-inch 2736×1824 display, though definitely not the same screen tech. It has three, yes three, USB ports, one USB-C and two regular USB ports. And the clincher is that it costs less than $500, including the pressure sensitive pen and the keyboard cover. Chuwi is running an Indiegogo campaign for discounts, but slots are extremely limited, so better fly over there if you’re interested. • CPU: Intel Celeron N3450 • RAM: 6 GB • Storage: 64/128 GB eMMC • Display: 12.3-inch 2736×1824 LCD TFT • USB: 1 x USB-C, 2 x USB 3.0 • Battery: 10,000 mAh • Pen: Yes (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 297.8 x 203.3 x 9.4 mm • Weight: 967 g • Price: $473/$498 Wrap-up So which Windows 10 2-in-1 tablet is the best? You’ll hate the answer but it doesn’t make it less true. “It depends”. But we can probably whittle the choice down to three. Best in performance: HP Spectre x2 (2017) Sorry Microsoft, it seems that HP has learned its lessons quite well. The 2017 HP Spectre x2 has just the right mix of power and versatility that trumps even the new Microsoft Surface Pro. And it throws in the pen and the keyboard in the price tag, too. If you’re looking for power, this is the one to beat. But, be prepared to also always be looking for a power outlet. Best in mobility: Huawei MateBook E If you were looking for a Windows 10 counterpart of the iPad Pro, then the Huawei MateBook E just answered your prayers. Presuming heat won’t be a problem given how thin it is, this slate offers the best compromise between power and portability. You are giving up one USB-C port you might have ad and you will need to buy the pen separately, but, hey, that’s why they call it a compromise. Best in price: Chuwi SurBook Hands down, this is the cheapest of all, but mind that you do get what you pay for. That’s not to say it will totally stink. The Celeron N3450 still beats the now outdated Atom x5 and x7 you’ll still see in some budget-friendly Windows tablets (like the Lenovo Yoga Book) so it might not be a complete dealbreaker. Considering what some have been able to accomplish even on barely powered older Atoms, you will definitely be able to get work done on the Chuwi SurBook. Unless your work happens to involve editing videos, creating hi-res multi-layer digital paintings, or playing Triple-A games.

Intel’s Newest 10-Core I9 Chips Is Now Coming As A Beast Motherboard Ralphy Bonn SimMay 28, 2017 07:36 PM EDT Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email WATCH RELATED VIDEO Submit (Photo : Ethan Miller/Getty Images) New information has been revealed for the upcoming Intel 10-core Skylake X CPU, the i9 7900X which looks like the chip could end up being more powerful. With its 10 core ability, it sports a base clock speed of 4.0GHz that boosts up to 4.5GHz. According to Hot Hardware, the latest details for Intel's i9 series CPUs spotted in a publishedSisoft Sandra benchmark result post. The specifications, however, should be perfectly accurate telling consumers that despite running 10 cores and 20 threads, this chip is still capable of hitting 4.5GHz without any overclocking.

Considering that this Intel's upcoming 10-core i9 chips were initially expected to be clocked far lower. While some tech enthusiasts speculated that this could be a revision on Intel's behalf to counter the potential for AMD's Ryzen CPUs to showcase its performance crown before the end of this year. According to HEXUS, several information about Intel's upcoming 10-core i9 chips were confirmed by listings which include the fact that it has 10MB of level two caches with 1MB for each core and 13.75MB of level 3 cache, along with a TDP of 175W. Another thing is that one of the highlighted features is the Intel CPU detail reveal, where consumers can draw a little information on the motherboard from it. Meanwhile, the Gigabyte X299 Aorus Gaming 7 is an announced motherboard and shows that Gigabyte will be one of the first partners supporting Intel's upcoming PUC design. To make a clearer view, chips like this aren't made for everyday consumers; the added performance of that high clock speed should further ramp up the competition between Intel and AMD that has been both on their momentum since last year's launch of Ryzen. Stay tuned for more updates.

Even at that early stage HEXUS readers poured cold water over the principle of such a processor, especially at its leaked inventory screen price of approx $177 (though it launched in January at $184). Today there are reports that Intel has slashed the price of its 2C/4T Kaby Lake Core i3-7350K chip to $149. I've found this price comes from Newegg, in what appears to be a sales promotion, rather than via any official revised Intel price list. Meanwhile in the UK it still seems to cost £170. The Intel Core i3-7350K runs at a stock base frequency of 4.2GHz (no Turbo Boost is available in the Core i3 family) and according to Bit-Tech it is easily and affordably overclockable "to 4.8GHz or 4.9GHz". In an interesting article dubbed Why the Core i3-7350K Is a Good CPU, back in January that site compared the i3-7350K processor in both application and gaming tests against an i7-7700K with HT disabled, running at stock 3.5GHz and found them to run neck-and-neck in almost all challenges. Back to the price cut news, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see permanent cuts to the Core i3-7350K price as it's been a few months on the market now and AMD's Ryzen 5 processors deliver 4C/8T processing from $169. HEXUS published a thorough review of both the AMD Ryzen 5 1400 and Ryzen 5 1600 (14nm) on Friday, in case you missed it. Our benchmark and performance tables include comparisons with the Intel Core i3-7350K CPU. In April we reported that Intel was accelerating its CPU and platform updates due to AMD pressure. Price cuts could also be part of Intel's strategy. We shall see shortly if any significant new announcements are made by Intel at Computex.

Burleigh: 20 years leading Intel Burleigh handled a range of different jobs during her time with Intel, becoming marketing manager in 2005 before she was handed the Australia and New Zealand MD role in 2005. Intel is the world’s biggest computer chip manufacturer. Jerry Tsao, Intel’s vice president sales and marketing group and general manager regional sales group for Asia Pacific and Japan, said that during her time at the company Burleigh had extended its influence to new areas. “Kate brought a new energy and creativity to the managing director role in Australia and New Zealand,” Tsao said in a statement. “Under her leadership, Intel’s impact extended well beyond our traditional customer base and channels. We thank Kate for the passion and dedication she showed Intel and wish her the best of luck in her future endeavours.” Burleigh said it was the right time to make the move after a long career in a sector renowned for high executive turnover. “I’m proud to say that I joined Intel when Andy Grove was still CEO and I’m as excited today as I was all those years ago about the transformative innovation that Intel is driving,” Burleigh said. “Although it is incredibly hard to leave such a fantastic company and so many great people, the time seems right for me to make a career change and pursue opportunities outside of Intel. I have been privileged to be at the centre of technology transformation thanks to Intel and trust I will have the chance to apply my passion for innovation in my future career.“ Along with growing and maintaining the prominence of a brand which largely lies hidden inside computers and laptops, Burleigh was also an advocate for science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and pushed for smarter government policy on technology. She leaves the role at the end of June with Intel saying it will announce her successor “in due course”. Simon Canning Simon is Mumbrella's marketing and advertising editor.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo Former national security adviser Michael Flynn will hand over documents and records to the Senate Intelligence Committee in response to a set of subpoenas for information from his businesses and personal files related to the committee's probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to a person close to Flynn. Lawyers for Flynn's team sent the committee a written response Tuesday indicating that Flynn would begin providing records in response to subpoenas by June 6, the deadline to start turning over such information. Flynn was required to indicate by Tuesday whether he intended to comply with the records request. The subpoenas were issued for two companies Flynn owns, Flynn Intel Group Inc. and Flynn Intel Group LLC. The committee also reissued a third subpoena for personal records, the focus of which was narrowed after Flynn rejected the committee's initial demand for personal records relating to his contacts with Russian authorities, claiming it was too broad and would jeopardize his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. After Flynn's lawyers rejected the committee's initial subpoena for personal records detailing any and all communications Flynn had with Russian officials, committee leaders turned to his businesses, arguing, in the words of vice chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., that "a business does not have the right to take the Fifth." The narrowed request focuses more closely on documents that the committee believes exist. But it is not clear if Flynn's willingness to comply with the new subpoenas means that the committee will be satisfied with the documents he turns over - or whether those documents will do anything to prove or disprove allegations that Flynn had improper contacts with Russian officials while acting as a surrogate for President Donald Trump. A spokesman for Warner declined to comment for this article Tuesday, while a spokeswoman for committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., did not immediately return a request for comment. The person close to Flynn said that the former national security adviser wants to cooperate with the congressional investigation as long as doing so doesn't violate his constitutional rights.

The highlight of Asus's mini-show was the ZenBook Flip S (UX370), which it says is the world's thinnest convertible laptop. It's a proper laptop, too, running Windows 10 and powered by a new Core i7-7500U processor from Intel and with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD under the hood, but it's less than 11mm thick. No price for it yet, but the $US1099 starting price translates into circa-$1500 in Australia. Its 13.3-inch screen can also be specced up to 4K resolution, and it's of course also a touchscreen — which makes sense since its hinges rotate a full 360 degrees. That display is nearly borderless, too, which reduces the ZenBook Flip S' overall size massively. If you don't need dedicated graphics, the Flip S looks like it'll be pretty tempting as an everyday, multipurpose laptop-tablet hybrid. In its performance-focused Pro line, Asus has bumped up specs significantly with the latest ZenBook Pro (UX550) — most notably by including Nvidia's desktop-equaling laptops graphics cards alongside equally gutsy quad-core Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPUs. I'm an unabashed fan of the price-performance ratio of Nvidia's entry-level GeForce 10-series chips and to see them in such a skinny laptop is an impressive feat. If you like the sound of that, here's the better part — the 15.6-inch ZenBook Pro is just 18.9mm thick and weighs 1.8kg, putting it well into the fighting class of competitors like Razer and Aorus. That display is a 4K one, of course, and the graphics come courtesy of Nvidia's not-too-shabby GTX 1050Ti — which won't have the power to run that 4K display at native resolution during gaming, but should handle lesser titles like Dota 2 or League of Legends with no sweat. Sitting in between the two is the ZenBook 3 Deluxe, a 1.1kg and 12.9mm thick Apple MacBook competitor built around a 14-inch display and with all the power that you could ask for from such a skinny device — fast SSD, fast Intel Core i7 CPU, dual Thunderbolt 3 support over USB-C and the like. Those specs make it the world's thinnest 14-inch laptop, apparently. Asus also took the opportunity to introduce something it calls the Blue Cave — a Wi-Fi router with dual-band 2600Mbps 802.11ac support, but without any obvious spiky antennas sticking out of the top. Rather than looking like a computing appliance, the Blue Cave is an odd-looking monolith of sorts — almost like a miniaturised washing machine without the door — that Asus thinks will look more appropriate in your living room. One thing conspicuously missing from Asus' presser, though? Its adorable — and now, maybe never to see the light of day — ZenBo home assistance robot.

Reply -1 bluxy @bluxy May 31, 2017, 8:30am can tell you are a console user, its main feature is being really thin, not gaming at all Reply 1 NegativeZero @negativezero May 31, 2017, 9:24am You don't need to get insulting, I'm not a dirty console peasant. :( My point was that for a 'performance focused' ultrabook the 1050 is really poor. Razer are squishing a 1060 and a better version of that CPU into a smaller footprint (14" vs 15.6") that's just as much a light, thin ultrabook. As an ultrabook it's quite nice. As a 'performance' ultrabook, it seems weak. But then I guess it's also very cheap. Reply 0 WhitePointer @whitepointer May 31, 2017, 10:59am Razer products are also grossly overpriced. You'll be paying a lot more than you would for the Asus. Reply 0 NegativeZero @negativezero May 31, 2017, 11:05am I live in the US. They're about par. Stated price is the starting price for this, btw. To get the fully specced version you'll be looking closer to $2200 AUD I expect. It's cheaper than Razer to be sure, but not sure how much cheaper, and worse hardware kind of means you'd expect to pay less anyway. Reply 0 luffy_luck @luffy_luck May 31, 2017, 8:39am It's not, for a lightweight notebook. it is actually surprising that it includes such a graphics card. Reply -1 matt1234 @matt1234 May 31, 2017, 8:51am 1050ti is roughly a GTX970m in terms of performance - that was the 2nd best laptop card available on the market for last gen. I had a GTX970m in my last laptop and could run all current games (at the time) at 1080p ultra with 60fps. It's not the best, but its still a damn good card for a laptop. Reply 1 NegativeZero @negativezero May 31, 2017, 9:29am My current laptop has a 970m in it and it's never been able to run at-the-time modern games at 1080p ultra at 60fps. 1080p medium, sure. Maybe high in some cases if you didn't mind 30fps with some hitching. You could probably get away with a 1050 Ti at 1080p. At 4k though?

There aren't many details out in the wild right now, but HTC has confirmed that the WiGig will be based on the 802.11ad standard and will work solely in the interference-free 60GHz band.  That should ensure latency of less than 7ms in any environment, and allow multiple Vive wearers to share the same space.  Of course, this isn't the first wireless peripheral HTC has endorsed. Back in November, the company unveiled TPCast's own wireless solution, and revealed the nifty attachment will cost $220.  Much like the WiGig, TPCast says its compact add-on won't have a noticeable impact on headset performance. VRDC Fall 2017 will be taking place at the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, CA September 21-22. Register today! Gamasutra, VRDC, and GDC are sibling organizations under parent UBM Americas.

Samsung Notebook 9 Pro comes in both 13.3-inch and 15-inch touchscreen display versions. Both the versions will be powered by Intel 7th Generation Core i7 processor, 8GB RAM on the 13-inch model, 16GB RAM on the 15-inch model comes and both featuring 256GB SSD. While the 13-inch model comes with Intel integrated graphics, the 15-inch model comes with AMD Radeon 540 Graphics with 2GB GDDR5 Graphic Memory. It comes with a USB Type-C port which can be used for charging the device and it also supports fast charging. It also comes with IR camera that supports Windows Hello for easy authentication. The main highlight of the device is its built-in S Pen that allows for a great inking experience. With a 0.7mm tip, it can detect more than 4,000 levels of pressure and the impressive tilt lets you write or draw in the most comfortable position. It also comes equipped with Air Command software that lets you take notes, edit documents, and draw. Unlike Surface Pen, the S Pen always stays on and never requires any charging. It is disappointing to see Samsung limiting itself to 1080p display on both the models. However, the Full-HD touch screen is equipped with RealView Display to deliver professional grade color accuracy, brightness and wide viewing angle clarity for up to 178 degrees.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Intel Kicks Off Computex 2017 with Big News By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: MAY 30 2017 Computex 2017, which is one of the largest IT trade shows in Asia, is starting off with a bang, with Intel unveiling its top-of-the-line Core i9 processor. The Core i9 is part of Intel's Core X line of high-performance desktop computer chips. Intel said its top-end model will be the first commercially available chip to reach teraflop speeds and contain 18 processing cores. The new line of Intel Core X processors is designed to meet the needs of users who want to run the most computationally intensive applications on their desktops, such as 3D modeling, VR editing, video game live-streaming, and special effects design. Ultra High End The prices for most of the new models in the Core X series are likely high enough to limit the market to enterprises and all but the most dedicated gamers and design enthusiasts. At the top of the list is the i9-7980XE Extreme Edition, which will come with 18 cores and 36 threads, and cost $1,999. The Core i9 (pictured above) will also come in versions containing 16, 14, 12, and 10 cores, priced at $1,699, $1,399, $1,199, and $999, respectively. There are also new models in the i7 series, which until now had been Intel's highest-end offering. These new chips will come in 8-, 6-, and 4-core varieties, and cost $599, $389, and $339, respectively. Meanwhile, the new 4-core, 4-thread i5 model will be available for $242. The 4-core models are based on Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture, while the other models are based on the company's Skylake design. All of the chips will work with the new X299 chipset. Lots for Content Creators To Love Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's client computing group, kicked things off at Computex with the keynote address. Bryant said that while the new chips will obviously appeal to gamers looking to eke out every iota of performance possible from their machines, the high-end i9 chips would also appeal to a growing number of content creators who face increasing performance needs. "Although every enthusiast is different depending on their interests, a common denominator is their hunger for the best performance," Bryant said in a statement. He described the new series of chips as the company’s most scalable and powerful desktop platforms ever. The new chips will provide content creators with fast image rendering, video encoding, audio production and real-time preview -- all able to run seamlessly in parallel, according to Bryant. Gamers, meanwhile, will be able to play their favorite games while streaming, recording, and encoding gameplay on a 12K display powered by up to four discrete graphics cards. The company said that its OEM partners have already developed motherboards and complete desktop systems based on the new chips and the X299 chipset, so consumers can expect to get their hands on the new machines in the next several weeks. Computex runs May 30 to June 3 in Taipei, with some 1,600 exhibitors. This year's expo focuses on "Building Global Technology Ecosystems," centered around 5 main themes: Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, Business Solutions, Innovations & Startups, Gaming & Virtual Reality, and IoT Applications.

EVGA's X299 motherboards go big for Core X by Eric Born  1:00 PM on May 30, 2017 Today's the release party for Intel's Core-X series CPUs and the corresponding X299 chipset, and everyone's dressed to the nines for the event. Joining the extravaganza of X299 motherboards announced today are three boards from EVGA ready to put those massive, power-hungry CPUs to work. The EVGA X299 Dark headlines the trio. EVGA equipped this massive E-ATX board with a broad array of overclocking tools. An efficient 14-phase VRM supplies power to the CPU, and the board tracks temperatures across ten zones. Catering to builders who like to tinker on an open bench, EVGA bundled a bench stand plate in the box, placed a voltage display on the board, and provided onboard power, reset, and CMOS clear buttons. Builders looking to push their memory to the limits can install quad-channel DDR4 clocked up to 4133 MT/s. A large cooling solution with a fan covers the two M-key and one E-key M.2 slots. Users who fancy other connectors for their storage devices won't be disappointed, as the X299 Dark also has 8 SATA ports and 2 U.2 connectors. Ethernet connectivity is handled by a pair of Intel Ethernet NICs. The motherboard supports up to 10 USB 3.0 ports, two USB 3.1 ports, and four USB 2.0 ports. Audio magic is provided by Creative's "quad-core" Core3D audio processor. EVGA's X299 FTW K motherboard has a bit more razzle and dazzle than the utilitarian X299 Dark. It's also in the EATX form factor, but decks out its I/O shroud and chipset heatsink with RGB LEDs and provides a header for blinkenlichten-equipped fans. More practically, the board offers eight slots for DDR4 DIMMs and uses the same VRMs showcased in the X299 Dark. The FTW K has the same storage connectors as model above but doesn't include the M.2 cooling solution. Ethernet connections come courtesy of a Killer E2500 NIC and an Intel Gigabit NIC. EVGA doesn't expect that all users are going to have an enormous case that can swallow up an EATX motherboard. The EVGA X299 Micro board brings the new chipset's power to the microATX form factor. Like its larger brethren, the X299 Micro employs EVGA's new VRM pack and supports memory clocked up to 4133 MT/s. With less board space available, the X299 loses a few of the niceties offered by the other models. It still has both M-key and an E-key M.2 slots, along with a U.2 port. EVGA did squeeze in dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi in addition to the Intel Ethernet NIC, and provides a fleet of USB ports including two of the USB 3.1 Type-C variety. Other than a promise that these motherboards are coming soon, EVGA hasn't tipped its hand on prices, nor when we should expect them to be available.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Computex 2017 iPhone 8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Hands on: MSI GT75VR Titan review Small, smart iterations potentially make this gaming laptop great Not yet rated By Kevin Lee Laptops & portable PCs  Shares What is a hands on review? Our Early Verdict The MSI GT75 VR looks like a solid desktop replacement, but it’s too early to call it without a closer look at the screen, and at just how far we can really push the system. For Overclockable CPU and GPU Tactile mechanical keyboard Against Thick as heck The GT75VR Titan is the first MSI gaming laptop to see a mechanical keyboard truly designed for a notebook. "Actually, the MSI GT80 Titan was the first," you might well exclaim – but that was a 18.4-inch beast with a keyboard meant for a desktop. By comparison, the MSI GT75VR Titan is an almost portable 17-inch laptop with a low-pile and tactile keyboard. It's still a monster of a machine, with an overclockable Intel HK-series processor and up to an Nvidia GTX 1080. However, without any pricing details, it’s too early to call it a winning rig. Design The centerpiece of the MSI GT75VR Titan really is the newly developed SteelSeries rapid RGB mechanical keyboard. And there’s no way to miss it really, especially if the keys have been programmed to sparkle with a rainbow of colors. Despite this not being a desktop-grade keyboard, the new rapid RBG mechanical keys offer a satisfying amount of key travel and click – they feel awfully familiar to the ones on the Razer Blade Pro. Aside from the keyboard, though, the MSI GT75VR Titan looks almost identical to the GT73VR Titan. The only real stand-out difference between the two models – aside from the keyboard – is the new 'pleather' palm rest that has a peculiar diamond-shaped cut around the offset arrow keys.  The soft material is much more comfortable than the basic plastic frame your wrists are left to hang on with most gaming laptops. Specs and configurations The MSI GT75VR can be specced up with the best mobile hardware on the market, including an Intel Core i7-7820HK processor and Nvidia GTX 1080. MSI hasn’t said if the HK-processor will be the CPU in the base model, but there are multiple graphics options, including the Nvidia GTX 1080 previously mentioned, as well as the Nvidia GTX 1070 in SLI and single-card configurations.  Users can also choose between three 17.3-inch screens, the first of which is a Full HD, TN display with an 120Hz refresh rate that MSI claims can render HDR-like colors. From our initial impressions, the TN screen renders colors brightly, although we can’t yet say if they’re accurate.  That said, if you’re really concerned about color accuracy there's also a Full HD IPS panel option, and an UHD (3,840 x 2,160) monitor with 100% Adobe RBG coverage. Otherwise, the MSI GT75VR Titan is designed to be a full-on desktop replacement with space for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM, one 2.5-inch HDD and two NVMe M.2 SSDs. Perhaps the most impressive part of the GT75VR is the Cooler Boost 5 Titan Technology, which allows the laptop’s CPU to overclock all the way to 4GHz. This system essentially combines two Whirlwind Blade fans with 12 heat pipes and four ventilation points. Unfortunately, MSI has yet to say how much any of these hardware configurations will cost. Early verdict If you’re looking for a gaming laptop with serious hardware and a mechanical keyboard, the MSI GT75VR Titan makes a lot more sense than the MSI GT83VR Titan ever did. However, this system is also coming into a space with plenty of competition, and it’ll be hard to pick this thick gaming laptop over thinner systems like the Alienware 17 and Razer Blade Pro.  After the announcement of Max-Q, it’s hard to consider a traditional desktop replacement when the Asus ROG Zephyrus and Acer Predator Triton 700 could offer the same experience in much more compact packages. What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

It will come equipped with a miniature chip attached to its back which will be able to reveal the bat's speed as it connects with the ball as well as its pick up and follow through arc for Stokes and teammates Jason Roy and Alex Hales . The ICC have partnered with Intel to come up with the new broadcasting technology that will also include a drone to help with pitch reports and virtual reality experiences for fans in ground. So the next time a commentator asks how hard Ben Stokes has hit the ball as it sails into the stands, there will be an answer.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Adrian's vision of the future and the presentation of the incentives that would cause people to buy these devices was pretty insightful." --May 2017 "The talk was entertaining because of the way that it was presented, where a garden path of wonder, highlighting the myriad of useful things with a very subtle undercurrent of what the implications were." --May 2017 "These events add real value to me as an employee, and as a citizen of the net." --April 2017 "I now have a much better understanding of the controversy surrounding the Snowden leaks and have an idea of what I can do as a private citizen to combat the government's use of mass surveillance." --April 2017 "The topic was compelling and the level of expertise of the speaker made the information received very credible and thus easy to find relevant to my work." --April 2017 "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Tuesday, 13 June 2017: Selling Your Attention: The Web and Advertising with Tim Wu Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Time: Noon PT / 3pm ET / 7pm UT Topic: Selling Your Attention: The Web and Advertising You don’t need cash to search Google or to use Facebook, but they’re not free. We pay for these services with our attention and with our data.</p> While advertising-supported media was once confined to a small part of our lives like newspapers and radio, our work and lives are increasingly online and ads take the front row in our daily lives. This business model can have a democratizing effect: it makes products and information accessible to many more people, who might otherwise be priced out. But it also means that the main audience for these companies is not you - the person using their services - but rather, advertisers who keep the lights on. History is punctuated by acts of refusal and outright revolt against this model, from the invention of the remote control, to the more recent rise of cord-cutting and ad-blocking software. Yet, whenever the attention merchants have seemed to lose their charm, they’ve always found a way to reinvent themselves and to recapture us. What does this mean for the future of the open Internet? What can we, as Mozillians who ourselves live largely off of advertising revenues today, do? Join us for a conversation with Tim Wu, historian, policy advocate and professor who coined the term “net neutrality," as he traces the history of the dynamics between advertisers, media and audiences, and calls on us to reevaluate what we are getting (or giving up) in exchange for our attention, especially in today’s always-on Internet. Host: Sam Burton Speaker: Tim Wu is an author, policy advocate, and professor at Columbia Law School who coined the term "net neutrality." Wu's best known work is the development of Net Neutrality theory, but he also writes about private power, free speech, copyright, and antitrust. His books The Master Switch and The Attention Merchants have won wide recognition and awards. Wu has worked in academia, federal and state governments. He worked at the White House for the National Economic Council; at the Federal Trade Commission, for the New York Attorney General’ as a fellow at Google, and for Riverstone Networks in the telecommunications industry. He was a law clerk for Judge Richard Posner and Justice Stephen Breyer. He graduated from McGill University (B.Sc.), and Harvard Law School. Wu is a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times, and was formerly a contributing writer at NewYorker.com and contributing editor at the New Republic. He has been named to the Politico 50 twice, to America’s 100 most influential lawyers, and also won awards from Scientific American magazine, National Law Journal, 02138 Magazine. He has twice won the Lowell Thomas Award for travel writing and in 2017 he was named to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Questions: During the event join us live on (1) IRC #AirMozilla and (2) Slack #speaker-series - be sure to direct questions to @samb Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Thursday, 20 July 2017: Are you an introvert? Working Across Personality Types with Jennifer Selby-Long Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Engineers are introverted. Agile = meetings all the time. Works well for extroverts. Over the past year a few hundred staff at Mozilla have used the Insights Discovery tool to better learn about their individual personality temperaments, and to be more effective on their teams. But can these tests really help us? What’s the real science behind them? Can they be abused? Or are there ways they can help us work together better? On July 20, Jennifer Selby Long, an expert in the ethical use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®), will lead us in a very interactive session on this material. She’ll help us explore these frameworks and the science behind them, with a focus specifically on their Introversion / Extraversion dimensions and workplace collaboration. Importantly, we’ll make it personal, rolling up our sleeves with some exercises to help us explore how our (and our team’s) MBTI preferences can help us work together better, regardless of job description, culture, or demographics. Hosts: Matt Frassica & Tyler Haugen Speaker: Jennifer Selby-Long Jennifer Selby Long is an executive coach, management consultant, and MBTI® expert who helps technology leaders navigate the challenges of seismic change to achieve their highest potential. She also advises on the impact of personality and gender on financial behavior. Jennifer is the past president of the Association for Psychological Type. She has been quoted by business and technology writers in the Fast Company, Information World, Dice.com, Univision, and the Bulletin of Psychological Type. She is an award-winning business writer and the author of Traveling Light, a blog helping leaders skyrocket their impact and lighten the load in their lives. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, 10 May 2017: When Surveillance Goes Private: A 2027 Retrospective from Adrian Hon Location: Mozilla London + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Transcript Topic: It’s 2027. In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Adrian Hon is CEO and founder at Six to Start, co-creators of the most successful smartphone fitness game in the world, Zombies, Run!. The game has won awards for its stories and storylike games, and the team’s work has been displayed at the MOMA and Design Museum in London. He’s the author of A History of the Future in 100 Objects, and he used to write about technology for The Telegraph. Previously, Adrian was Executive Producer and Director of Play at Mind Candy from 2004 to 2007, where he designed and produced the Perplex City alternate reality game (ARG). Adrian’s interest in ARGs began with the genre itself in 2001, when as a moderator for the Cloudmakers community for ‘The Beast’ (an ARG for Steven Spielberg’s A.I.), he wrote a detailed walkthrough for the game, called ‘The Guide.' During that time, Adrian studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in experimental psychology and neuroscience. In 2003, he began a neuroscience DPhil at Oxford, but left after a year to join Mind Candy. Adrian has also spoken at the main TED conference in Monterey in 2001 (about the human colonisation of Mars), as well as various SXSW, GDC, Economist, and other such tech and gaming conferences.

Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

The Core i9 is part of Intel's Core X line of high-performance desktop computer chips. Intel said its top-end model will be the first commercially available chip to reach teraflop speeds and contain 18 processing cores. The new line of Intel Core X processors is designed to meet the needs of users who want to run the most computationally intensive applications on their desktops, such as 3D modeling, VR editing, video game live-streaming, and special effects design. Ultra High End The prices for most of the new models in the Core X series are likely high enough to limit the market to enterprises and all but the most dedicated gamers and design enthusiasts. At the top of the list is the i9-7980XE Extreme Edition, which will come with 18 cores and 36 threads, and cost $1,999. The Core i9 (pictured above) will also come in versions containing 16, 14, 12, and 10 cores, priced at $1,699, $1,399, $1,199, and $999, respectively. There are also new models in the i7 series, which until now had been Intel's highest-end offering. These new chips will come in 8-, 6-, and 4-core varieties, and cost $599, $389, and $339, respectively. Meanwhile, the new 4-core, 4-thread i5 model will be available for $242. The 4-core models are based on Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture, while the other models are based on the company's Skylake design. All of the chips will work with the new X299 chipset. Lots for Content Creators To Love Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's client computing group, kicked things off at Computex with the keynote address. Bryant said that while the new chips will obviously appeal to gamers looking to eke out every iota of performance possible from their machines, the high-end i9 chips would also appeal to a growing number of content creators who face increasing performance needs. "Although every enthusiast is different depending on their interests, a common denominator is their hunger for the best performance," Bryant said in a statement. He described the new series of chips as the company’s most scalable and powerful desktop platforms ever. The new chips will provide content creators with fast image rendering, video encoding, audio production and real-time preview -- all able to run seamlessly in parallel, according to Bryant. Gamers, meanwhile, will be able to play their favorite games while streaming, recording, and encoding gameplay on a 12K display powered by up to four discrete graphics cards. The company said that its OEM partners have already developed motherboards and complete desktop systems based on the new chips and the X299 chipset, so consumers can expect to get their hands on the new machines in the next several weeks. Computex runs May 30 to June 3 in Taipei, with some 1,600 exhibitors. This year's expo focuses on "Building Global Technology Ecosystems," centered around 5 main themes: Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, Business Solutions, Innovations & Startups, Gaming & Virtual Reality, and IoT Applications.

TYAN showcases a full lineup of platforms based on the upcoming Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family that are targeted at the Data Center, Virtualization, Supercomputing, Enterprise and Embedded infrastructure markets. "With increased needs of data-intensive applications driven by the growth of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and high-performance computing, customers need an advanced solution to address the demands of big-data, in-memory workloads for their server infrastructures," said Danny Hsu, Vice President of MiTAC Computing Technology Corporation's TYAN Business Unit. "TYAN plans to offer latest server platforms based on the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family from mid-2017, and promises to offer workload-optimized performance, power efficiency, and platform features." High-density GPU and Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor Platforms Optimized for HPC and Machine Learning Applications TYAN's next generation HPC computing platforms are all based on the Intel Xeon Scalable Processor Family and are designed for the heavy computing workloads of big data and high performance data analysis applications. To meet these demands, TYAN have three platforms on display that target the HPC, Machine Learning, and Technical Computing markets. The FT77D-B7109 is a 4U dual root complex GPU server with two CPU sockets and support for up to 8 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor x200 series cards. The platform specializes in embarrassingly parallel workloads including scientific computing, genetic sequencing, oil & gas discovery, large scale facial recognition, and brute force cryptography. TYAN is also displaying a new high performance workstation platform named the FT48T-B7105. This workstation gives maximum I/O to the professional power user, with support for up to 5 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors and is aimed at Digital Content Creation, Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI), and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) applications. TYAN's GA88-B5631 is a fully peer-to-peer single root complex 1U GPU server. Featuring a single Intel Xeon Scalable Processor Family CPU socket, the platform supports up to 4 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor, and is ideal for many of today's emerging cognitive computing workloads such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. TYAN Highlights Extreme Performance, Density and Scalability for Next-Generation Datacenter, Enterprise and Cloud Powered by the latest Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family, TYAN's new range of cloud computing and storage platforms are optimized for data intensive workloads and virtualization applications to deliver extreme performance, density and scalability with power and cost efficiency. The 1U GT75B-B7102 with support for 10 2.5" small form factor SATA bays, four of which can support NVMe U.2 drives, is an ideal platform for virtualization and in-memory databases. TYAN's 1U GT62F-B5630 is designed for hybrid NVMe/SATA cache storage with support for up to 8 hot-swap NVMe U.2 drives along with an OCP v2.0 LAN Mezzanine. The single CPU socket design makes it an ideal platform for workloads that work best within a single NUMA domain and require large amounts of high-speed flash, such as many media streaming applications.

MSI joins the X299 party with mobos for every taste by Jeff Kampman  6:00 AM on May 30, 2017 Intel took the wraps off its Core X-series CPUs and X299 platform this morning, and MSI is ready with three X299 motherboards to host those CPUs. We'll be meeting with MSI later this week to learn more about its X299 hardware, but for now, take a gander at the X299 Gaming M7 ACK, the X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC, and the X299 Tomahawk. The X299 Gaming M7 ACK sits atop MSI's X299 lineup, and it debuts the company's M.2 Shield Frozr heatsink design. This combination chipset-and-storage heatsink purportedly prevents PCIe storage devices hooked up to this board's twin M.2 slots from throttling. This high-end X299 board also boasts a 10+1+1-phase VRM design that MSI calls "DigitAll," plus a "Turbo" version of the LGA 2066 socket. This board also features twin Killer Gigabit Ethernet ports, plus a Killer 1535 Wi-Fi adapter. MSI touts the X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC as a modder's delight. Expect interchangeable heatsink covers and mounting points for 3D-printed accessories from this X299 board. Of course, MSI's Mystic Light RGB LED system is along for the ride, and a pair of M.2 Shield heatsinks could keep hot PCIe storage running at its maximum potential for longer. If understated looks and high performance are more your speed, the X299 Tomahawk might be just the ticket. This board sports stainless-steel heatsinks (including an integrated M.2 Shield and chipset cooler), metal-reinforced PCIe slots, and a front-panel USB 3.1 header. Stay tuned for more details of MSI's X299 lineup later this week. Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The group's goal is to create mutually beneficial partnerships with multinational organizations and to accelerate their sustainable market entry and presence within the GCC. The SEED Group has been a key point in the success of all its partners in the region helping them reach their target customers and accelerate their businesses more rapidly.

UAE is fast building its reputation as icon for innovation and creativity making companies like YDreams, which is a natural fit into the country's national innovation strategy," stated Mr. Hisham. Mr. Japiassu said about the Cooperation Agreement, "Negotiations have been ongoing since our last trip here, when we had the pleasure of meeting the SEED Group and their great team. We see Dubai as a perfect fit for our expansion plans. It's a unique ecosystem that thrives in innovation and is always seeking top companies to work with. There are several fields that we will explore and this partnership may bring us close to incredible opportunities. Some of the most creative and ambitious projects in the world are in the UAE. Being part of it was one of our main targets for 2017." Dubai will host one of the most important events of the 21st century, the Expo 2020, when the city will become the center of the world. Many millions of visitors are expected between its opening day in October 2020 and its closing date in April 2021. Daniel Japiassu was accompanied by Mr. Omar Halloum, who will be working closely with the SEED Group in new business and relationship development in Dubai and Qatar.

Intel® just took the wraps off its long-awaited Core™ X-Series processors and accompanying X299 chipset, which bring enough horsepower and bandwidth for everything from professional content creation to hardcore gaming. The new LGA2066 processors require new motherboards, and ASUS has a diverse lineup split between the Prime, TUF, and ROG families. We'll discuss the innovative Prime and TUF products now, and you can check out the latest from the Republic of Gamers in this article. The Prime and TUF models are designed for differing audiences: new Prime X299-Deluxe is for high-end builders who want it all, the Prime X299-A eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics, the TUF X299 Mark 1 stands out from its competitors with protective armor and advanced cooling options, while the TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down to the essentials for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula. The new ASUS Prime and TUF X299s series are a breath of fresh air at a time when far too many motherboards offer more of the same. Prime time for X299 Built for power users and prosumers, the Prime series represents the culmination of decades of experience refining all aspects of motherboard technology. These boards mate state-of-the-art connectivity with accessible tuning options to provide a premium experience everyone can enjoy. All of our X299 motherboards have extensive overclocking and cooling options available in both the UEFI and software. The Primes go one step further with 5-Way Optimization, which intelligently overclocks your system and tunes the cooling based on the individual characteristics of your components. Beginners can effortlessly optimize their entire PC with a single click, while experienced users can adjust tuning parameters to meet their needs. Refinement extends to the styling, whose predominantly black-and-white theme lays the perfect foundation for understated builds-or much flashier ones with RGB lighting. Our Prime X299 boards feature multiple headers for LED strips that can light up your entire chassis. They're part of a rich ecosystem of Aura Sync products that can synchronize colors and effects across a complete system, from the motherboard and graphics card to peripherals and other components. Intel's new Core™ X-Series processors boast up to 12 cores and can be paired with as much as 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. The beastly chips demand serious cooling, which is why all of our new X299 motherboards have dedicated headers for all-in-one liquid coolers and stand-alone pumps. Core™ X-Series processors also have up to 44 PCI Express 3.0 lanes available for graphics cards and NVMe SSDs. Our Prime X299 series supports up to three-way graphics configurations, and their x16 slots incorporate structural reinforcements with our SafeSlot technology to prevent damage and protect your investment. PCIe lanes left unused by graphics can be devoted to storage with VROC, which combines multiple M.2 SSDs in a bootable RAID array connected directly to the CPU. An insane number of drives can run in parallel across multiple VROC cards to deliver staggering throughput and warp fast access for system drives. Our X299 boards also support Intel's Optane Memory, which provides a solid-state cache to accelerate other storage devices. This new generation receives our latest on-board audio enhancements, including a Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier and premium components that produce immersive and crystal clear sound which rivals some dedicated sound cards. TUF enough to endure Our Prime X299 motherboards are balanced by entries from the TUF family. These models march to a different beat that prioritizes reliability and durability for PCs built to go the distance. They use tougher components than conventional counterparts, and they're subjected to more stringent testing. Shifting focus requires a new outlook, and TUF answers with distinctive designs that meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine. Stealthy by nature, the new boards minimize RGB lighting to concentrate on different priorities. ### AVAILABILITY & PRICING ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe, Prime X299-A and TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboards will be available at leading resellers in North America starting in late June. Suggested MSRP pricing will be announced by 6/19/2017. For additional information, product images and specifics on the Prime and TUF series boards, please check out our launch article at Edge Up.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Computex / Computex: Gigabyte unveils first X399 motherboard for AMD’s Threadripper Computex: Gigabyte unveils first X399 motherboard for AMD’s Threadripper Matthew Wilson 6 days ago Computex, Featured Tech News, Motherboard A few weeks back, AMD officially announced that it would be launching its new HEDT platform this summer, with the 16C/32T ‘Threadripper’ CPU set to be the star of the show. As you would expect, this means motherboard makers are now beginning to give us a look at their plans for AMD’s X399 chipset, with Gigabyte bringing its first X399 Aorus Gaming 7 motherboard to Computex this week. While much of the details surrounding X399 are still under NDA, we are able to show you some images of the motherboard, though the socket has been kept hidden from view. For X399, AMD’s socket is officially named TP4. From what we have heard, AMD’s TP4 socket is more expensive to make than Intel’s equivalent. However, the cost of AMD X399 motherboards are expected to sit in a similar price range to X99/X299. Aside from that, this Gigabyte Aorus Gaming 7 motherboard will retain many of the same features found on the X299 Aorus Gaming 7 board. However, AMD’s version will lack Intel LAN ports, optane memory support etc. KitGuru Says: There has been a lot of discussion surrounding Intel’s new Core-X CPUs and X299 today, so it’s nice to see some AMD news ahead of the company’s own conference tomorrow. Still, with AMD’s chipset being called X399, I do wonder what Intel is going to do when it introduces its next HEDT chipset.

Good point. AMD Guru It is, Threadripper uses a LGA package vs the Ryzen “Summit Ridge” AM4 socket which is PGA. You probably already knew that though. 🙂 AMD Guru Intel can still use the X399 moniker for there next iteration of the HEDT platform. Just because AMD is using it now, means nothing. SkyBill40 Interesting to see this go LGA rather than their familiar PGA arrangement. I wonder as to the reasoning for doing so? Were the chips just not going to work any other way from a manufacturing/fab point or was it something else? Deshi They are using the same socket as their server platform which they are using lga for. Pga is only for consumer chips. SkyBill40 But this is being marketed… at consumers. So, to that end, this doesn’t make all that much sense. If they went LGA for the EYPC CPUs since those are obviously purpose designed and built for server applications, that would be something entirely different. Rob C LGA has a greater connection density. PGA has pins on the Chip which are a fulcrum (a lever to bend and apply a very tiny amount of unwanted pressure). If a pin breaks on either then it’s practically ruined (not impossible to repair if you’re desperate). Cheap Chips and expensive MB, use PGA. Expensive Chips and cheap MB, use LGA; even more so when there’s a lot of pins. PGA is (usually) gold pins which must be kept straight and forced into a hole. LGA is (usually) bent pins that touch a pad on the Chip (like PGA with all the pins cut off, leaving the circular pads). The pad on LGA can be a small oval (instead of the larger circular area of PGA) and the springing action of the LGA’s bent pins act on the (potentially) lower pressure socket holder. LGA takes a bit less gold, certainly far less on the Chip, reducing the Chip cost and probably using less gold on the MB’s pins since only the tip needs to be plated. The Chip is created first (ala which came first, the chicken or the egg) and LGA makes the Chip cheaper and more reliable. After the Chip is made then MB Mfgs can choose to make a MB for the Chip – MB’s are not made first and then the CPU must conform, so it’s the Dog that wags the tail (the expensive and more technical device decides what goes where). If we were to never upgrade the whole thing could be Wave Soldered. LGA could be Wave Soldered and PGA can not – so LGA does double duty (that is not popular enough to be utilized very often with CPUs). Did I miss something? SkyBill40 Thanks for the (unnecessary) lesson covering the differences between the two. I understand the two applications just fine; my wonder has to to with AMD’s rationale to switch it. That’s all. Derek Cole I do the job from ease and comfort of my own home, by doing quick gigs that solely demands from you a Laptop or computer and also web connection and I am also more happy than ever before… After six months time with this job and also i obtained cash in whole 36,000 us dollars… Basically I generate approximately 80 bucks/hr and work for 3 to 4 hours time everyday.And appreciable factor regarding this job is the fact that you can supervise time and effort any time you get the job done and for how much time as you like and you earn a paycheck weekly.>>>> VZTURL.COM/bni14 uziwooshan prolly too big for a pga SkyBill40 If that is so, then the move to LGA makes sense. Nicholas Reichart HEDT != Consumer SkyBill40 You know what that acronym means, right? High End Desk Top. So, how is that not marketed at consumers? Nicholas Reichart HEDT, which means Enterprise and high end workstations These aren’t something you’d buy for your home computer. Most sales will be b2b SkyBill40 We’ll see. Nicholas Reichart You can drive a Bugatti in snow, that doesn’t make it normal There is no “we’ll see” Statistical outliers don’t count Deshi Actually the platform (Epyc) was designed for professional and businesses. they just decided to use the same platform for the consumer HEDT market (renamed to threadripper with some tweaks) to save money, just like Intel did.

But it also launched its biggest PCs ever, with its new MEK brand. Here are the details, plus four more mini PCs I saw at their booth on Tuesday. Zotak MEK: Little tower PCs The first Zotac PC on this list is actually relatively large. The MEK is a Mini-ITX designed tower PC (it can only stand up and can’t be laid flat) and it comes packing some impressive internals. The model on display at Computex came equipped with Intel’s latest quad-core Core i7-7700 alongside one of Zotac’s own tiny GTX 1080 Mini graphics cards. There’ll be NVMe-based SSDs, two DDR4 RAM slots and a tiny 450W SFX-form-factor PSU. They come in both white and black, and the LED strips will be customisable come launch. Expect to see these before Christmas. Zotac ZBox MA551: A Ryzen-powered multimedia box The MA551 certainly isn’t the most exciting looking PC Zotac’s built, and it’s also quite a lot larger than its previous efforts. However, this living room PC comes with an as-yet undecided mid-range AMD Ryzen CPU, two DDR4 memory slots for up to 32GB of RAM, six USB 3.0 ports and a front-mounted card reader. If you fancy an Intel machine instead, the MI553 is identical but has kit from the Blue Team instead. Zotac ZBox PI225: A PC the size of a battery pack This is Zotac’s smallest PC yet. It’s a tiny thing powered by Intel’s latest N3350 “Apollo Lake” Atom processor. You It’s powered over microUSB and can connect to a 4K display via one of its two USB-C connectors. It’s just 10 x 6 x 8cm in size, so be careful not to lose it down the back of your sofa. Zotac Zbox Magnus EN1050: eSports mini PC Zotac launched its GTX 1060-powered EN1060 at least year’s Computex, and now the company is bringing the price down with one that comes with a cheaper, less powerful GTX 1050 on board instead. Zotac is trying to get the price into the region of £600, although whether that’s possible remains to be seen. Zotac Zbox Magnus ER1060 Gaming: A big mini gaming PC Zotac has modified its higher-end Zbox machines, getting rid of the more expensive MXM-based graphics chips and instead using their own tiny graphics cards connected via a more standard PCIe connector, as you’d find in a regular PC. From the outside it makes no difference and you can’t really see evidence of the PCIe graphics chip unless you look around the back for the video out ports. The older models were liquid cooled, but with the switch to PCIe, there’s a single fan instead. Are compact PCs your bag?
