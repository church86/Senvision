MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Analyst suggests Wintel will energize the VR market 0 by Surur  @mspoweruser Sep 3, 2016 at 21:33 GMT4 months ago Writing on Venturebeat, analyst Jack Gold of  IT analyst company J.Gold Associates predicted that the marriage of Microsoft and Intel’s mixed reality efforts will bring VR to mainstream acceptance and lead to the creating of a large VR ecosystem as early as next year. Gold was referring to Intel’s recent announcement of Project Alloy, their reference design for a VR headset which uses their RealSense 3D sensors and Intel Core  processors to create a high performance VR system, and Microsoft’s support for the venture with the folding in of Windows Holographic, the platform for the HoloLens, into all versions of Windows 10. Announced by Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich  at Intel Developer’s Forum in San Francisco, Gold expected the reference design will see 10-15 designs of Project Alloy derived VR devices in market within the next year and competing platforms ultimately being sidelined. He noted the advantages of the Microsoft/Intel platform was that standards bring increased investment and deployment which will ultimately make products available to users at lower cost and with better features/functions while creating a critical mass around which a full ecosystem can ultimately explode. He also expected it will expand the market beyond gaming to include a myriad of business-oriented and consumer-friendly solutions. He writes: I expect this announcement will energize the world of VR over the next 2-3 years and create a burgeoning marketplace. This will force early device makers (e.g., Oculus, Epson) to pivot over the next 1-2 years, as proprietary designs will capture a limited market relegated to specialty solutions. If the platform achieved the adoption he predicts he expects an aggressive growth spurt building out a hardware/software ecosystem that will make VR affordable and achieve mass market penetrations, both for consumer and business users. 25 years ago Microsoft and Intel together tamed the wild PC market, but while Gold’s analysis is compelling, and Microsoft and Intel are both well resourced, the two companies have never faced competitors as rich and persistent as Google and Facebook, who both already have their own VR platforms, and Apple, who is believed to be working on one. It is not clear if merely having a free, open and stable ecosystem will be enough to succeed. Do our readers think Wintel can do it again? Let us know below.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 3, 2016 at 11:29AM Image source: Getty Images. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) built their businesses around the PC. Intel, the dominant supplier of x86 CPUs, has felt the sluggish demand for PCs. It produced a lower net income in 2015 than it did in 2010, driven by slumping PC sales and the failed attempts to break into the mobile market. NVIDIA, on the other hand, has benefited from a resilient gaming PC market. Sales of its graphics processors, particularly high-end models, have surged in recent years, driving the company's revenue to record levels. Both have been diversifying away from PCs, with Intel putting a heavy focus on data center products and NVIDIA growing its enterprise and automotive businesses. The two companies are clashing in the accelerator market, where NVIDIA's dominant Tesla GPUs are being challenged by Intel's 72-core Knights Landing chips. Intel is aiming to increase the quantity and variety of chips it sells into the enterprise, putting NVIDIA in its crosshairs. With the heyday of the PC long gone, Intel and NVIDIA will likely look very different 10 years from now. With that in mind, one question remains: Which stock is the better buy? The case for Intel Image source: Intel. Despite a weak PC market, Intel remains a wildly profitable company. Its growth engine in recent years has been in its data center segment, where its server CPUs enjoy a near-monopoly. That may not be the case forever: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), International Business Machines, and ARM Holdings are all attempting to chip away at Intel's server dominance. But for the time being, Intel remains the king. The data center segment now generates almost as much operating income as the client computing segment, which includes chips that go into PCs and mobile devices. The company's recently updated five-part strategy reflects this shift. The first priority for Intel is the cloud and the data center, with connected devices coming second. Intel still enjoys a major advantage in the PC CPU market, as one of just two companies that sell x86 PC CPUs. AMD, which hopes to win back market share from Intel next year with its upcoming Zen CPUs, is the other. Historically, AMD has never been able to remain competitive for all that long. The last time AMD was a major force in the PC CPU market was about a decade ago. Analysts are expecting Intel to produce $2.50 per share in adjusted earnings this year, putting the P/E ratio at about 14. The company will face many challenges over the next few years as it deals with more competition in its core markets and that could derail earnings growth. But for those who believe Intel can successfully navigate through this post-PC era, the stock trades at a fair price. The case for NVIDIA Image source: NVIDIA. Shares of NVIDIA have exploded over the past year, soaring 170%. Over the past five years, the stock is up more than 360%. There have been multiple factors driving these impressive gains. The company's core PC graphics card business has been booming, with sales of its higher-end cards driving record revenue. NVIDIA's unit share of the discrete graphics card market increased from around 60% in 2014 to 80% in 2015, leaving AMD with the scraps. Beyond PC graphics cards, NVIDIA has been growing two other businesses. In the enterprise, the company's Tesla GPUs are increasingly being used for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks, with the largest cloud computing companies buying the cards by the thousands. In the automotive market, NVIDIA's DRIVE platforms are being adopted to both power in-vehicle displays and aid with the development of autonomous vehicles. NVIDIA's chips are already in a variety of models, including the Tesla Model S. In all of these markets, NVIDIA will be facing plenty of competition. In the graphics card market, AMD recently launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards in an effort to win back market share from NVIDIA. In the enterprise, Intel is gunning for NVIDIA with its Knights Landing chip. And in the automotive market, there's no shortage of companies aiming to stake a claim in the self-driving car of the future. Its stock has surged because investors expect NVIDIA to be able to grow swiftly in the coming years. But with shares now trading for 40 times trailing-12-month earnings, the company's falling short of expectations could send shares tumbling. The verdict While NVIDIA appears to have superior growth prospects, in part because it's so much smaller than Intel, the lofty valuation makes it difficult to recommend. For that reason, Intel looks like the better buy. A lot of things will need to go right for NVIDIA in the coming years for the stock to grow into its valuation, and I suspect that the market has gotten a little too optimistic. Intel also has the benefit of a far superior dividend, with the stock yielding nearly 3% compared to just 0.75% for NVIDIA. Intel is facing many challenges, and its extraordinary dominance of the server CPU market may not last. But despite these issues, the stock looks more attractive than NVIDIA's.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Sony Ultra 4K streaming service comes to Intel 7th Gen Core PCs Adam Westlake - Sep 3, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit While 4K televisions are finally starting to come down in price, the availability of 4K video content to watch on them is still slim. To help push the sales of its own 4K TVs, earlier this year Sony announced its own 4K streaming video service dubbed Ultra. Now the company wants to make the Ultra service available on PCs, and has teamed up with Intel to launch it in January. The only catch? Users must be running Intel’s new 7th Gen Core processor. Announced earlier this week, the 7th Gen Core processor, also known as “Kaby Lake,” was designed by Intel to handle the latest high-def gaming and media content available now and in the near future, including VR, 360-degree video, and 4K streaming. The 7th Gen Core processor is expected to be available in over 100 different devices before the end of the year. When Sony’s Ultra service launches on PCs in January, it will offer the existing option of buying new releases for $30 (older films are $26), but also new options like 48-hour rentals for $8 and free 10-minute previews. The reason for Sony teaming up with Intel is likely because of the 7th Gen Core’s support for the latest forms of DRM, the main concern film studios have when allowing their movies to be streamed to PCs. While 4K content is available now, copy protection technology means it’s a crapshoot if users can get it to play on their PC.

The waiver is from regulations regarding daylight operation and the operation of multiple small unmanned aircraft. Intel is authorized to operate multiple small unmanned aircraft systems at night within Special Security Notice Flight Restriction Areas in the United States. This waiver is in addition  to the Section 333 Exemption that Intel received to fly multiple aircraft in the United States earlier this year for its Drone 100 light show. This FAA waiver allows  Intel in the U.S. to innovate beyond Drone 100 to 100s and even 1000s of drones in the future. Drone 100 is a light show that demonstrates how Intel pushes the boundaries of what is possible and shows people an exciting new way to experience the wonders of drone technology. Intel has showcased Drone 100 globally  receiving the Guinness World Record for this innovative breakthrough. Intel has performed private shows with 100 drones flying at night in Germany and at twilight in Palm Springs, California. Intel debuted the first public showcase of Drone 100 in Sydney on five consecutive nights where the drones took off from two barges in Farm Cove, witnessed by more than 100,000 spectators. Intel looks forward to showcasing this technology and related light shows in the United States  expanding the technology and the number of drones in the light show. In addition to showcasing creative expression, Drone 100 highlights the exciting future of UAVs, including the different ways to integrate them into different industries. In the future, this technology can also be applied in other segments, from commercial to search and rescue uses, allowing for faster and more efficient operations and missions.

Chipzilla has obtained a waiver from the US aviation regulator that will let it fly the massive drone show on American soil without the need for further clearance or special permission. That waiver, based on the FAA's Rule 107, allows Intel to perform the demonstration of 100 drones, each controlled by the same operator, lining up with light boards to display its iconic logo. The Drone 100 shows have been conducted by Intel on several occasions around the world, including a show earlier this year over Sydney Harbour depicted in the video below. Though the Rule 107 process has been seen as a more efficient way for smaller companies to make use of drones in their business activities, in Intel's case the rule is also allowing the multi-billion dollar company to expand its large-scale drone operations. Youtube Video Natalie Cheung, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) product manager for Intel's perceptual computing group, told The Register that the Rule 107 waiver replaces an old process that Intel (and other businesses) had to undergo in order to get Section 333 exemptions signed off by the FAA before flying drones commercially. On August 29, the FAA sought to largely eliminate the need for those exemptions when it implemented Rule 107, a set of guidelines that allows companies to obtain a one-time license to fly small drones commercially. Intel's waiver goes a step further and allows the company to also fly its drones after dark and pair multiple craft with a single operator, things not normally allowed under Rule 107. This, in turn, allows the Drone 100 shows to take place in the US at special events without having to go through as many hoops. Granted, Intel had a significant leg-up on getting the waiver; it had previously worked with the FAA under the old Section 333 process, and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich personally chaired an FAA small drone advisory committee. "It was easy to work with the FAA, we used a lot of what we had with our Section 333 waiver," Cheung said. "There were not any questions about the use case, because this was something they had seen before." While letting Chipzilla run light shows with a hundred drones is all well and good, the Section 107 waiver could also help to push the development of technologies that would have a more immediate real-world impact. In the long term, Cheung said that the hardware and software Intel is developing to control 100 drones at once, and the work it did with the FAA to get the process green-lighted, could be used by companies to operate "fleets" of drones to perform tasks such as surveying an area through a single point of control. "I see there is a huge potential for this technology," she said. "Having a fleet versus just one drone can make operations more efficient and faster." ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 18 Comments More from The Register Microsoft, IBM, Intel refuse to hand over family jewels to China US giants balk at demands to reveal source code, schematics 52 Comments FAA powers up an invisible hand, groping the skies for rule-busting biz drones Top tip: Keep flying cams away from Robert Duvall's house 20 Comments FAA doubles Section 333-exemption drone ceiling to 400 feet Commercial operators also get shiny new registration Website 13 Comments FAA rules out fast-tracking drone regulations No Jeff, Amazon won't get its own drone airspace just yet 6 Comments Heathrow airport and stock exchange throw mystery BSODs BSOD WATCH Bonus: even more Acorn on show 25 Comments FAA to test Brit drone-busting kit Jamming tech will 'detect, track, disrupt and defeat' flying menaces 31 Comments Whitepapers Overcoming the Obstacles to the All Flash Datacenter The top 6 challenges that can slow your adoption of all flash technology, and show you how to overcome them.

Microsoft Unveils the World’s First Windows 10 and Intel Joule Powered Robot GO Intel Joule support is being added in Windows 10 IoT Core AU Sep 3, 2016 08:05 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is working hard to improve Windows 10 IoT Core, and the Anniversary Edition is bringing support for Intel Joule, the development board that’s often described as the most powerful and innovative to date. And because Microsoft just couldn’t stay away from the Intel Joule, the Windows Insider Program will be updated in September with a new Windows 10 IoT Core build that will include support for this computer platform. The software giant is super excited to see Intel Joule being added to Windows 10 IoT Core’s supported platforms list, and to better emphasize the opportunity that developers are getting with this update, the company is unveiling Bamboo, the world’s first robot powered by Windows 10 and Intel Joule. World, meet Bamboo! Bamboo runs on the Intel Joule and uses Microsoft Azure and Cognitive Services to provide sentiment analysis and translation, which makes it possible to speak to the robot in absolutely any language on Twitter and then have it translate the text into native English. And what’s more, the robot can understand your mood, Microsoft says, and react accordingly. And it doesn’t stop here. The robot can “move around and build and understanding of the environment” with an interconnected system made of Intel Joule and Intel RealSense cameras, while all the movements are possible thanks to the EZ-Robot EZ-B control system. “Using the EZ-Builder software for Windows and a newly released EZ-Robot UWP library, you can design and animate your robots on a Windows PC, as well as auto-generate and export UWP control code to run on the EZ-B V5. We used this functionality to animate Bamboo. The bring up and integration of the EZ-B v5 took just under 6 weeks,” Microsoft explains. Microsoft demonstrated the new robot at the Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco, and the company says that anyone can bring their ideas to reality with the Intel Joule and the future update to Windows 10 IoT Core coming in September. #Microsoft#Windows 10#Windows 10 IoT Core#Intel Joule subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Next Windows 10 RS2 Build with Wi-Fi Bug Fix to Launch “In the Next Few Days” Microsoft Makes Subtle Changes to Windows 10 Mobile Hardware Requirements Windows 10 Wins Gamers, Gets Closer to 50 Percent Share on Steam New Browser with Ad Blocking Launches on Windows Phones New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    This is Bamboo, Microsoft's first Windows 10 IoT Core and Intel Joule robot New Apps Babylon: Get one-click translation in any desktop application and term search results within an extensive collection of dictionaries and glossaries Chameleon Startup Manager Lite: Software utility which enables you to edit and manage the processes running on your computer, with support for multiple languages Chameleon Startup Manager Pro: A startup management tool that enables you to quickly remove unneeded startup items and monitors the system for new apps set to launch with Windows Portable CDBurnerXP: CD/DVD and Blu-ray burning software solution that can be launched directly from a removable drive, without requiring prior installation Collectorz.com Movie Collector: A fully-featured application that helps users create a movie database, group movies into folders, perform searches, and catalogue DVDs by their barcode ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application GPU-Z Portable: A reliable and useful software solution that comes in handy to all those who want to keep an eye on the data regarding their video and graphics cards Reader comments Apple Says It Won’t Leave Microsoft Alone on the Desktop, Promises Future iMacs more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 2, 2016 at 9:23PM Image source: Intel.  Last year, I spotted an interesting job listing on microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) job boards. The listing talked about how the company was looking for a processor designer to work in the company's relatively new Microarchitecture Research Lab located in Bangalore, India. This processor designer's job would be to join a team of engineers to "spearhead the research and advanced development" of both processor cores and graphics processors intended to arrive in the "2020 and beyond timeframe." These designs, per the listing, were intended to be manufactured in Intel's "futuristic" 7-nanometer manufacturing technology, signaling that Intel planned a significant advancement with this technology. Interestingly enough, Intel has posted an updated version of this job listing that might offer some clues into the company's future technology introduction plans. 2020 becomes 2022? Here's the relevant quote from the updated job listing (emphasis mine): The India Lab specifically, in collaboration with MRL-US and Intel product architecture teams worldwide, will spearhead the research and advanced development of Microprocessor Cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. By conceiving of and prototyping radical approaches, the Lab will aim to deliver much greater CPU power and area efficiency while still delivering industry-leading performance. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel's sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade. It would appear that Intel's new launch time frame for these new processor cores has been pushed out by a couple of years, from 2020 to 2022. Although it may be the case that Intel is now targeting, perhaps, the 5-nanometer manufacturing technology with these cores, rather than the 7-nanometer technology as explicitly mentioned in the original version of this listing, I don't think Intel would have said "sub-10nm technology nodes" if that's what it meant; it would have said "sub-7nm technology nodes." Expect the first 7-nanometer products in 2021 I suspect what's going on here is that Intel had originally planned to release products manufactured on its 7-nanometer technology in the 2020 time frame, but for whatever reason the company has delayed that until 2022. If we consider what Intel has publicly said about its manufacturing plans, this actually makes a lot of sense. Intel is expected to go into manufacturing on its first 10-nanometer products during the second half of 2017. For simplicity, let's assume that volume availability of 10-nanometer product doesn't happen until January 2018. Intel has said that it plans three waves of 10-nanometer technology: 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++. If Intel keeps to an annual product launch cadence, then we should see volume availability of the first 10-nanometer+ products in January 2019, and the first 10-nanometer++ products in January 2020. Based on this cadence, which is admittedly probably on the pessimistic side, the first products based on 7-nanometer would be expected to launch in January 2021 -- a bit earlier than the 2022 time frame given in the job listing. What Intel could be planning, then, is to introduce substantially enhanced chip designs a year after the first 7-nanometer products, which could very well be modest updates to the final 10-nanometer++ products. In fact, Intel's product cadence is now referred to as "Process, Architecture, Optimization," so fundamentally new architecture products on 7-nanometer could, indeed, arrive in January 2022.  What does this mean for Intel? It's unfortunate that Intel seems unable to get back to releasing significantly new manufacturing technologies every two years. However, because the company now plans to make annual performance improvements to each new technology over a period of three years, Intel should still be able to deliver improved and competitive products to the marketplace -- which is what ultimately matters.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | September 3, 2016 -- 01:18 GMT (18:18 PDT) | Topic: Cloud SHANGHAI, CHINA--Networks will need to keep pace with increasingly connected societies and the need for deeper insights to improve service delivery and support digital transformation. With the Internet of Things (IoT) era beckoning, everything soon would be connected and data-driven and customers would no longer look to simply buy a platform or individual parts, said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, during his keynote at Huawei Connect 2016 held here this week. They would be looking for an experience and no activity would occur in isolation, he said. Latest news on Asia Brandis extends submission deadline on telco data retention for civil proceedings Samsung to reveal Galaxy Note 7 probe findings this month: Report Samsung continues to add flagship specs to its Galaxy A line Lenovo updates ThinkPad laptops with Windows 10 Signature Edition, Intel Optane storage tech Singapore startups must now grow up, think bigger Intel describes the phenomenon as a virtuous cycle, in which all things that are connected including wearable devices, autonomous vehicles, and M2M systems will require connectivity to send data through to the cloud to be analysed and push back down the analytics so experiences can be changed. Supporting this continuous feedback loop also would require collaboration between multiple companies, since no one organisation would be capable of producing all the ingredients needed, Krzanich said. He further stressed the need for infrastructures that were able to cope with the large volumes of data and network traffic generated today. The average person currently produced between 600MB and 700MB of personal data a day, he noted, and this was expected to climb to 1.5GB by 2020. By then, autonomous cars were projected to generate as much data as 3,000 people combined. "That's a lot of data and a huge network load, but also represents huge opportunities to optimise [network performance] and create value," he said. It underscored the importance of 5G networks, which Intel believed would be critical to support this emerging environment. These networks would need to be flexible and able to deliver the highest possible throughput, he noted, pointing to the reason the chipmaker was working with Huawei on 5G initiatives. Cloud infrastructure also would need to be flexible so they could adapt to data flow between various workloads, he added. Krzanich said: "In our increasingly smart and connected world, we need fast, intelligent, and efficient wireless networks, cloud technologies, and analytics capabilities to create amazing new experiences in our everyday lives." During a media briefing, ZDNet asked about the potential of building more intelligence into device chipsets so smartphones, for instance, would be able to handle data analytics and relieve some workload from the core network. In response, Huawei's rotating CEO Guo Ping said it was essential to build up computing capabilities not only in the device, but also in the network and cloud. He added that the Chinese company's main strategy also revolved around these three components, which it believed were critical in supporting intelligent societies. In his keynote, Guo also highlighted the importance of industry collaboration--a point that was frequently touted by other Huawei executives during the conference. He said the company believed that, in the cloud era, building a bigger pie was more important than fighting for a bigger piece of a shrinking pie. It also adhered to the philosophy that managing cooperation was more important than managing the competition, he added, noting that the former proved more challenging since it meant all parties involved would need to work together to deliver better services for customers. In addition, Huawei believed sharing benefits with others would be important to drive the evolution of the cloud ecosystem, he said. According to the company's president of products and solutions, Ryan Ding, Huawei also had been boosting its support for developers to encourage more to build applications and services on its platforms. Last year, it announced plans to invest US$1 billion over five years to galvanise 1 million developers on its platform by 2020. Since then, US$200 million had gone towards developing an "open enablement platform" and improving developer experience, while US$100 million was used to create a global marketing platform to help developers tap new business opportunities, Ding said. There are currently more than 25,000 developers registered to build on Huawei platforms, he said, adding that this community has developed more than 800 applications, to date. Based in Singapore, Eileen Yu reported for ZDNet from Huawei Connect 2016 in Shanghai, China, on the invitation of Huawei.

Intel bought McAfee in 2010 and eventually renamed it “Intel Security.” McAfee has since joined digital gaming company MGT Capital Investments Inc as chairman and chief executive, with plans to rename the company “John McAfee Global Technologies Inc” McAfee says Intel warned him that any use of his name will infringe on the company’s trademarks that it acquired with the McAfee deal in 2010, according to his complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court. An Intel spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the suit. Private equity firm TPG is among potential bidders for Intel’s McAfee unit and has held preliminary discussions with Intel about a deal that could value McAfee at as much as US$3 billion (RM12.2 billion), according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the process is private. Intel is also talking to other potential bidders, including buyout firms and corporate suitors, they said. Intel is considering offloading the antivirus software unit as part of a strategy to focus on its more profitable data-centre business. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker acquired McAfee in 2011 for US$7.7 billion to build security features directly into its silicon products. McAfee, 70, announced a run late last year as a presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, campaigning on a privacy-focused platform that includes pushing for the government to create a cybersecurity defence strategy. The party’s nomination was won by former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. McAfee is also a founder of Future Tense Secure Systems Inc, a security and privacy company that provides apps including D-Vasive, according to its website. MGT Capital has a consulting agreement with the company, also known as Future Tense Central, according to a May statement. In 2012, while living in Belize, McAfee had run-ins with local police for alleged unlicenced drug manufacturing and weapons possession but was released without charge. Later, Belize police started a search for him as a person of interest in connection with the murder of his neighbour. McAfee moved to Guatemala, where he was detained and released before eventually returning to the US McAfee said he was innocent. The case is McAfee v.

Tech Reviews RDP Thin Book Review: Can a Rs 10000 laptop satisfy your daily needs? By Sohil Nikam - The thin line of price that distinguishes laptops from tablets is fast blurring, and RDP Thin Book is a result of that. Priced at just Rs 10000, it is competing against the cheap Chromebooks from companies like Xolo which are sold at similar prices. But it has a few things that they don’t – it runs Windows 10 and grabs a big 14.1-inch display. In contrast, the cheap Chromebooks run the Internet-friendly Chrome OS and feature 11-inch displays. With RDP being a relatively fresh name, does the Thin Book really stand the test of everyday use or is it just a really cheap inferior laptop looking to grab your attention with its low price tag? Let’s find out! Specifications The thin and light RDP Thin Book’s display sports a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels on its 14.1-inch estate. Inside it, you’ll find a 1.84GHz Intel Atom quad core X5-Z8300 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM, which is not expandable. And of course, with the Intel chipset, you get integrated Intel HD graphics. There’s also a 10000mAh battery inside it, which sounds promising. The storage is limited to just 32GB and there’s a microSD card slot offering 128GB of additional space. Which brings us to the ports on this laptop. On one side, you have a headphone or speaker jack, a microSD card slot and a USB 2 port. And on the other side, there’s a power input for the charger, a micro HDMI port and… a USB 3 port. Now that’s a pleasant surprise. Video Review Design The RDP Thin Book boasts of a thin and light profile, and this adds a lot to its overall appeal. Despite its big screen, it’s pretty easy to carry around thanks to its 1.5kg weight and 20mm thickness. The plastic material on its body is quite smooth to the touch on the top, where it’s also a bit wonky, but the bottom end has a much more grippy and sturdy surface. Due to its light weight, the Thin Book cannot be opened with one hand. Plus it wobbles a good deal each time it’s opened. The unit we received strangely had a plastic coating on the display which could not be removed because it was sealed. Due to this, we could never see the time or the date on the desktop, plus there was some irremovable lettering on the other side as well. We tried contacting RDP to confirm whether this will be present on all models or is it just a one-off issue, but we haven’t heard back from the company as yet. Moving on, you get a VGA webcam along with this laptop, apart from two microphones, which make for satisfactory video calling experiences. A great little perk is that the laptop offers a noticeably large trackpad. And the keyboard; although it has well cushioned keys, is not helped by the unstable surface. RDP’s Thin Book has dual speakers which oddly enough, deliver audio from the bottom rather than the top. A bit of an oddball is that the orientation of both the USB slots is downward rather than upward, but you shouldn’t take time to get used to this. To give you a lowdown, the design of the RDP Thin Book looks good to the eye, but the many compromises quickly become visible when you start using it. You’ll have to handle it with extreme care to make it last for a long time. Display & Sound Like we said before, the fact that a 14.1-inch display is available on a Rs 10000 laptop itself is a big deal. And the 1366 x 768 pixel resolution on this LCD panel is satisfactory to say the least. It can’t get as bright as you might want it to be in outdoor environments, but it’s great for indoor use. As for the viewing angles, they can best be called admirable. In terms of sharpness too, it’s not anywhere near great. Well, the speakers on RDP Thin Book are really, really bad. They sound incredibly muffled, and have a very low volume. Even at maximum volume, we were struggling to listen to the dialogues in movies. Connecting your headphones or external speakers to its audio jack is the only way you can satisfactorily watch videos or listen to music on it. Performance and Functionality Now you have to understand that being an extremely cheap laptop, the RDP Thin Book is not capable of handling heavy games or applications. It’s primarily built for those who just need a laptop for using the Internet and watching movies on the go. For these two tasks, it delivers quite a pleasing performance. Browsing with multiple tabs open was never an issue. We even tried running Minecraft on this machine, and were surprised by how quick it was to start. The game ran smoothly all throughout without any hiccups. Typing on the keyboard as well as using the trackpad wasn’t an issue, and the latter does support scrolling gestures. The RDP Thin Book comes preinstalled with a 32-bit Home version of Windows 10, which is something that helps it gain a big advantage over the cheap Chromebooks. You are getting all the basic functionalities of the OS including Cortana support. There’s even a DOS version of the laptop which can be bought at Rs 9000. Speaking of benchmarks, on SunSpider, it managed to grab a score of 939ms, while its BaseMark score reached 73.35. Now these benchmarks can by no means be called impressive, but the Thin Book is anyway not trying to impress you with its power. The copying speeds are decent, and the USB 3.0 port is great for those with compatible hard disks or flash drives. And now for the battery life. The 10000mAh battery of the Thin Book is claimed to offer 8.5 hours of usage by its makers. Our unit could never achieve that number, but we did manage to extract about 4.5 hours of heavy web browsing time from it with the screen brightness set to max. The bottom line is, this laptop’s low-grade internals are nothing to worry about if you require it for basic tasks like web browsing, streaming movies or using Microsoft Office. Pros – Good overall performance for a laptop so cheap. – Windows 10 comes pre-installed. – Large-sized display as compared to other similarly priced laptops. Cons – Poorly built body. – Bad speakers. – Unresponsive customer service. Verdict The main point of concern here is whether the RDP Thin Book should be preferred over the similarly priced Chromebooks or not? The answer will be a yes if you’re a Windows fan, but do take note that the body and the overall construction of this laptop is very poor and it’s not something that will last you long. And the customer service was unresponsive when we tried contacting it. But for being a cheap yet well performing Windows 10 notebook with a 14-inch display, we’re giving it 3 out of 5 stars.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets Zen and Kaby Lake will only support Windows 10 Microsoft continues its heavy-handed tactics to push PC enthusiasts towards Windows 10, locking Intel's Kaby Lake and AMD's Zen support to the OS By: Derek Strickland | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Sep 2, 2016 7:11 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA The latest CPUs from Intel and AMD won't be supported on Windows 7 or Windows 8.     Much to the dismay of Windows 7 users everywhere, Microsoft is keeping its word: Intel's new 7th-generation Kaby Lake and AMD's Zen processors will only work with Windows 10 PCs.   Back in January Microsoft wrote up a controversial edict that tried to shorten Skylake's lifecycle on legacy Windows OS and lock newer CPU hardware--including Kaby Lake and Zen--exclusively to Windows 10. After tons of pressure from the PC crowd, Redmond relented on Skylake...but what about Kaby Lake and Zen? Both processors are on the horizon, and PC enthusiasts need to know if their OS will be compatible.   Microsoft has now confirmed to PC World that its decision concerning Kaby Lake and Zen is final: Windows 10 only.   "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support," a Microsoft spokeswoman told PC World, reiterating the initial proclamation. "This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon."     For comparison, here's the original post:   "Going forward, as new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon. For example, Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel's upcoming "Kaby Lake" silicon and AMD's upcoming "Bristol Ridge" silicon," reads the controversial post.   Intel has also confirmed that it will adhere to Microsoft's decree and has no plans to update Windows 7/8 drivers to support Kaby Lake:   "We are committed to working with Microsoft and our ecosystem partners to help ensure a smooth transition given these changes to Microsoft's Windows support policy," an Intel rep told PC World. "No, Intel will not be updating Win 7/8 drivers for 7th Gen Intel Core per Microsoft's support policy change."   But what happens if you ignored the warnings and tried to boot up Windows 7 or 8.1 with Kaby Lake or Zen?   No one knows for sure, but some guess that the experience would be decidedly unreliable and buggy. Others say that it might boot up, but a portion of apps would be unusable and the OS would crash.   But we know one thing for sure: Microsoft wants everyone using Windows 10, and they're willing to do anything to make that happen.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Ireland Stands United with Apple in Appealing the EU's Tax Ruling as War of Words Escalate | Main | Apple's "Peek and Pop" is now a Registered Trademark » September 02, 2016 Future iMacs Supporting Intel's 7th Gen Core will usher in Immersive Internet Era       While Apple's MacBooks will be sporting new Kaby Lake Seventh-Gen Core processors from Intel this fall, the iMac remains questionable unless Apple substitutes the processor with a mobile version (which is highly unlikely). A note from Intel's Navin Shenoy, VP, GM Client Computing Group, clearly points to Seventh-Gen Core processors for desktops only coming to market in early 2017.   Shenoy wrote late last week that "We are incredibly excited about the strong partnership with our OEM customers and expect more than 100 different 2 in 1s and laptops powered by 7th Gen Intel Core to be available starting in September through this holiday season. We will share more on the rest of the 7th Gen Intel Core family for desktops and enterprise PCs early next year." Rumors point to the new desktop core processors will launch at CES, but only time will tell if that rings true.   Shenoy's general message about seventh-core processors was focused on pumping up the 'immersive internet' where access to 4K Ultra High-Definition, 360-degree video, and virtual reality will dramatically rise.   Shenoy added that "With new computers powered by 7th Gen Intel Core, TV and movie fans will have access to premium 4K UHD content streaming from studios like Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and providers like FandangoNOW. This is just the beginning as we see 4K UHD content go mainstream over time. We're excited about some additional content announcements in the next few months, so stay tuned."   Engadget noted in a recent report that "4K video is finally gaining a foothold in home theaters this year, but for most PCs it's practically kryptonite. Even if you're lucky enough to have a powerful computer, dealing with such high-resolution video is a surefire way to spike your CPU usage and gobble up battery life. So it's little surprise that Intel made 4K performance the centerpiece of its long-awaited seventh generation Core processors, which were officially announced today. You can also look forward to a slew of other speed-enhancing features when the new chips hit laptops in September.   So just how good are these new batch of Core processors? How about a CPU utilization rate of around 5 percent and power usage of 0.5 watts on the new Core i7-7500U while playing local 4K video. That's compared to 40 to 70 percent CPU usage and a 10.2 watt power draw on its predecessor, the i7-6500U. And when playing 4K VP9-encoded video on YouTube, the new seventh generation i7 clocks in at 10 to 20 percent CPU usage while drawing 0.8 watts of power. The previous chip, on the other hand, ate up 70 to 80 percent of the CPU while taking up 5.8 watts of power."   To make the immersive internet experience richer for Macs, Apple is reportedly enhancing their future systems with AMD cards based on the Polaris architecture which are  designed for fluid frame rates in graphics, gaming, VR and multimedia applications running on compelling small form-factor thin and light computer designs."     So if the immersive internet appeals to you because you want to watch, create and experience higher quality HD 4K & 360° videos and games without over burdening your system, then hold off until Apple delivers iMacs supporting Intel's 7th Gen Core. Will Intel supply Apple's 2016 iMacs with these new chips ahead of schedule in the hopes of gaining more business from Apple, or will we have to wait like everyone else? While the former is likely the reality of the matter, we can always hope for the latter. Just don't hold your breath.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

As spotted by Laptop Mag, the Core m name is largely going away in favor of Core i, which means it’s going to be much harder to tell exactly how powerful the processor is inside of a new laptop. At least in the short term, that’s a problem because there’s a real difference between the two lines. Core i processors are what you find in most laptops, like the Surface Pro and MacBook Air, and are powerful enough that you don’t have to worry about them handling a modest workload. Core m processors, on the other hand, are what you find in super-thin fanless laptops; they’re less capable and sometimes choke up even from browsing the web. So it’s important to know what you’re getting, because a laptop is going to work differently depending on what’s inside of it. But starting with this year’s Kaby Lake processors from Intel, it’ll be much harder to tell. Processors that formerly would have been known as m5 and m7 models are now going to be listed under the i5 and i7 lines. Without a close look at their model number, it won’t be clear whether you’re getting a powerful MacBook Pro-style processor or a weaker MacBook-style processor. Intel thinks this makes things less confusing The decision seems likely to confuse people into believing they’re getting a more capable processor than they actually are. But Intel argues that’s not quite right. It says the name change comes in response to feedback from consumers and manufacturers and is “really an effort to make things less complex.” “We have also made significant performance improvements” to the Core m line “such that both form factor and performance lines were blurring,” Intel’s Scott Massey writes in an email to The Verge. “So yes, there are differences (as there are with all the different SKUs), but they aren’t as big as it was when we first introduced Core m two years ago.” Massey compares the difference to the distinction between dual- and quad-core chips, both of which have lived under the Core i name for years, despite the distinction between them. The difference between m- and i-style chips isn’t always that large either, he adds, as m chips range up to 7W in power, while i chips go as low as 7.5W. “So the handoff from one level to another is very close and not a big leap as some might have perceived a few years ago,” he writes. To his point, we’ve seen real improvements in Core m chips year over year: take our 2015 MacBook review, where we found the laptop struggling to manage 10 Chrome tabs, then compare it to our 2016 MacBook review, where we were “actually surprised at how fast it felt.” The renamed Core m-style processors It’s easy to understand why Intel would want to consolidate under the Core i name. Core i is well known and widely advertised, which means this change is going to be good news for computers with m-style chips in the short term: they’ll come off looking better — or, at a minimum, different — than they actually are. It’ll also be easier for Intel and its partners in the long term. Core m-style chips will likely become the norm for laptops over the next few years, as their performance improves and demand for super-thin laptops continues to grow. By renaming the chips, Intel and PC manufacturers can keep on promoting the Core i brand, rather than putting the work into convincing consumers that the Core m name is just as trustworthy. But what’s good for manufacturers is not necessarily good for consumers. And it seems fair to say that’ll be the case here. More often than not, laptops are advertised without stating their processor’s full model name. You can usually — but not always — dig the full model name up by looking through spec sheets, but that’s a frustrating step that most people aren’t going to take. That means people are going to be buying Core i processors that don’t come with the performance generally expected of them. Look for “Y” to tell the difference between m and i There’ll still be a way to tell the difference between m-style and i-style chips, if you can find a processor’s model number. Core m-style chips include a “Y” in their model number, like this: i5-7Y54. Chips that traditionally would have been in the Core i line will continue to end their name with U, like this: i5-7200U. It’s possible the distinction between m-style and i-style chips won’t matter as much in a few years. Core m-style chips could get more capable, or laptops that include power-heavy Core i-style chips could fall out of fashion. But that doesn’t really matter right now. Right now there’s a big distinction between the two lines, and if you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to check for that Y to know what you’re really getting.

To calculate the market size, the report considers revenue generated from the shipments of stick PCs. Competitive vendor landscape According to the report, the global stick PC market has only a few vendors, but Technavio analysts expect the entry of more vendors in the market in the coming years. Intel, ASUSTeK Computer, and Lenovo will be well established in the market due to their strong foothold and brand in the global PC market. "Competition in the market is low as the market is still in the initial stages of development. Intel has paved the way for new product lines, which are considered to be the replacement for portable PCs. This has attracted many vendors to the market. The majority of the vendors in the market use Intel processors in their products. This has strengthened the foothold of Intel core x86-based processor," says Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead computing devices research analyst from Technavio. The competition among the vendors is based on the availability of the products, features, and processing speed. The brand name will play an important role in the adoption of stick PCs, including the brand of the core processor installed in stick PCs. The report also states that emerging stick PC brands are opting for Intel processors, but established brands such as Google are introducing stick PCs with Rockchip processors. These variations are meant to promote their products and strengthen their foothold in the market. The increase in the volume of stick PCs will help the vendors lower their cost of production and also integrate technologically advanced components such as high density NAND, LPDDR4 RAM, and SoC to enhance value proposition. Request sample report: http://goo.gl/JoJ1vd Top 12 stick PC market vendors ARCHOS In 2016, ARCHOS has planned to establish itself as the major European network provider for connected objects through its subsidiary PicoWAN. PicoWAN is a global network operator. ARCHOS PC Stick is its only product that falls into the stick PC category. Its popularity in Europe can help it achieve significant market share in the European countries. ASUSTeK Computer ASUSTeK Computer is one of the top vendors in the PC market. It owns 7.9% market share of the global PC shipments. In the stick PC market, it owns three types of products, two of which have Intel processors and one uses the Rockchip processor. Chromebit is its only product that uses the Rockchip processor and is the reason behind the low cost of this stick PC. Azulle Azulle is a start-up that provides only one stick PC product with a 2GB RAM and 32GB internal memory. It is the only vendor that provides LAN to the stick PC, which gives it an edge in the market. Chenzi The company's product portfolio includes Android-based tablets, stick PCs, 3D converter boxes, digital converter boxes, enclosures, netbooks, karaoke players, portable TVs, and LED TVs. It offers only one stick PC, i.e., iView Cyber PC with Intel processor and a 2GB RAM and 32GB internal memory. Hannspree Hannspree has only one product in its stick PC portfolio Hanspree Micro PC desktop. It has a 2GB RAM and 32GB internal memory. The company has a good reputation in the tablet PC market, which it can use to its advantage. iBall In 2015, iBall launched its first stick iBall Splendo in collaboration with Intel and Microsoft. As iBall is based in India, it can gain an edge in the global stick PC market if it is marketed properly in its home country. Due to the low price of stick PCs, they have a significant potential in the Indian market. Intel At CES 2016, the company introduced a new model of Intel Compute Stick with an upgraded processor, from Atom to Cherry Trail, to improve the graphics performance of the stick PC. Even the price was increased to USD 159. Lenovo Lenovo offers products such as PCs, tablet computers, smartphones, workstations, servers, electronic storage devices, IT management software, and smart televisions. MagicStick MagicStick is a start-up and has two models of stick PCs: MagicStick Wave and MagicStick One. It is the only vendor in the market that provides an 8GB RAM. The company can use this specification to market its products to gamers and gain an edge in the overall market. Meegopad Meegopad's portfolio includes Intel Stick PC, Intel Mini PC projectors, and Android TV sticks. The company has five stick PCs in the market, four of which have an internal memory of 32GB and one has an internal memory of 64GB. Meegopad A02, which provides Remix OS 2.0, is the only product that has an expandable memory of up to 128GB, and it uses Allwinner processor. MODECOM MODECOM is one of the top vendors in PC cases market. In 2001, the company started its own production facilities in China to increase its production capacity. In 2003, it started the production of 2.1 and 5.1 speaker systems, which had great success during their launch due to their unique design. Panache Panache has only one type of stick PC, i.e., Panache Air PC. It has a 2GB RAM and 32GB internal memory. It provides Windows 10 OS and has an expandable memory of up to 128GB.

Highs Sharp, sturdy design Solid 4K gaming performance Quiet under load Lows Can be difficult to replace components No overclocking Doesn’t perform as well as expected Too much bloatware DT Editors' Rating 5.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Desktop Reviews > Acer Predator G1 review By Brad Bourque Posted on 09.02.16 (updated on 09.12.16) Research Center: Acer Predator G1 As graphics cards become more power efficient, and previously large components like drives take up less space than ever, the demand for compact gaming PCs is growing. It sounds nice, doesn’t it? An Xbox-sized PC, whirring away next to your 4K TV or monitor, without taking up the right half of your desk. Many companies are trying to pack a high-end GPU and a nice CPU into an Xbox-sized chassis. Acer’s attempt is only 4 inches wide and 13 inches tall. It boasts a Core i7-6700, 32GB of RAM, and Nvidia’s GTX 1080, with Predator branding leaking from the seams. Acer isn’t the only one with a small chassis, however. The Predator G1 has serious competition in the form of systems like the beautiful and powerful Falcon Northwest Tiki, and the newly redesigned Orign Chronos. These are powerful rigs from tried and true gaming manufacturers, and they’ve never failed to win us over. Will the Predator G1 find itself in good company, or does it have some catching up to do? Looks like a gaming PC The smallest Predator desktop takes it design language from the larger computers in the line, with a futuristic tank tread appearance. It’s adorned with red highlights for the high contrast look gaming companies are into nowadays. Not that there’s anything wrong with that — the G1’s execution is clean, sturdy, and attractive. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends It’s small, too. At just 14 inches tall and 5 inches wide, the G1 is about 2 inches larger in each direction than an Xbox One, and much smaller than mid-tower gaming PCs. It’s deeper than the Tiki and Origin, and one third of an inch wider. All three systems are quite heavy, but the Acer’s odd power adapter, which is just two mobile power supplies clicked into a frame, helps cut some weight. Related: Falcon Northwest Tiki (2015) review All three systems are sturdy, attractive, and stable, so the real question comes down to one of preference. The Predator G1 wears its gaming intent on its sleeve, while the Origin Chronos is a more subdued take on the look, with a few red highlights here and there. The Falcon Northwest Tiki, meanwhile, is downright elegant – something the Acer can’t claim. A custom I/O shield that disappoints The G1 is obviously a gaming system, with colorful LEDs up front and a tank-tread, wrap-around look. Around the back of the case, users will find four USB 3.0 ports, six-port audio, and Ethernet. In addition, the graphics card provides a set of video outputs, in this case, three DisplayPort, one HDMI, and one DVI-D. The front features 3.5mm audio in and out plugs, USB 3.0, USB Type-C, and an SDXC slot. That’s an acceptable variety of ports, given the G1’s slight size, but it’s less satisfying in the context of competing systems. Both the Chronos and Tiki boast full access to a Z170 or X99 motherboard’s suite of ports, which includes more USB 3.0 ports, dedicated 2.0 ports for keyboard and mouse, internal display options, and in some cases PS/2 and optical audio ports. Type-C is a nice feature, but it’s starting to become a common sight. Room inside, but not to grow Inside, the Predator G1 is surprisingly spacious. The ITX motherboard is small enough to leave some room for ventilation, which is mostly handled by a blower fan near the top of the case in the back. The CPU cooler looks a little smaller than even a stock Intel cooler, though we can’t help but wonder why Acer didn’t opt for closed-loop CPU cooling in such a small rig, as both the Tiki and Chronos do. Related: Origin Chronos (2016) review Upgrading some of the parts is less appealing than others. The GPU is tucked away behind a shroud that’s screwed onto the frame. Removing it requires taking off the hard drive, unscrewing the panel, dealing with the riser, and detaching it from the shroud. Some upgrades also require removing the rear I/O panel, which means removing both side panels instead of just one.

The power supply, which is just two 230-watt mobile power supplies in a cradle, doesn’t leave much headroom compared to the typical high-end build. Most competitors offer larger power supply options. No overclocking allowed The Intel Core i7-6700 in the Predator G1 is an odd choice. We’re much more used to seeing the unlocked Core i7-6700K instead – the $50 price bump is typically well worth the unlocked multiplier. The catch here is that the Acer is using a motherboard running on Intel’s H110 specification, which shaves some dollars off the price tag for a reduced feature set. It doesn’t support overclocking as a result. So, does this more conventional Core i7 hold up? The Chronos and Tiki shoot past the G1 in multi-core tests, thanks to their many-cored processors and unlocked multipliers. 7-Zip’s built-in benchmarking tool puts most of the systems on a more level playing field, although once again the Chronos claims almost double the other systems’ score. It’s a far cry from the higher-end systems, taking almost twice as long as the Chronos to convert a 4K video in Handbrake. The CPU is fast, but leaves us wanting more, with no way to get it. Drive slow, homie Our review unit, the only available configuration at publishing time, packs in both a 512GB SSD and a 2TB mechanical drive. Unfortunately, the SSD in the Predator is only an eSATA drive, and it doesn’t quite reach the performance of PCIe-supporting M.2 drives that are perfect for these smaller-than-average systems. Both the Chronos and Tiki offer a choice between eSATA and PCIe drives. Gaming in a lab The graphical power in the Predator comes from Nvidia’s latest and greatest, the GeForce GTX 1080 with 8GB of graphical memory. We’ve reviewed systems with two of them in SLI, but this is our first with the single card. This may be our first system with a single GTX 1080 inside, but even we can tell something isn’t quite right. Its score floats right around or under 16,000 in Fire Strike, which is almost identical to the GTX 980 Ti. Other reviews of the GTX 1080 put its performance over 20,000 at the low end, a big enough gap that the Acer Predator’s locked CPU likely isn’t the culprit, so what is? There are a few possibilities. The first is the G1’s awkward power situation. One of the two 230W power supplies is for the GPU, while the other handles the rest of the system. How this happens isn’t exactly transparent, however, and the GTX 1080 demands 180W of dedicated power in a 500W suggest system power. Whether the single brick is enough to power the card is tough to say. The CPU is fast, but leaves us wanting more. The other possible issue is the H170 motherboard. Skylake chips support 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes, but some of those lanes could be used for other devices than the GPU, like USB 3.0 expansions or wireless networking. The H170 chipset supports an additional 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes. A GTX 1080 should be able to run without saturating the PCIe bandwidth, but it’s tough to tell with any certainty how those lanes are assigned. If the card has to share lanes with other devices, it may not be able to transfer that data fast enough. Whatever the cause may be, the card isn’t running to its full capacity. We requested, and were sent, a second test unit to see if we could clear up the problem. Unfortunately, it remained. Gaming on the road The Predator G1 underperforms in synthetic tests, but the real question is how it holds up in some real-world gaming tests. Despite our misgivings about the Predator’s 3DMark scores, it holds its own in gaming, even at 4K resolution. In Fallout 4, with the settings cranked up, the system sits at an average 63 frames per second, just over the ideal 60 FPS score. Related: Ditch your console and frag the right way with our favorite gaming PCs The G1 hit the engine’s framerate cap at 1080p in both Battlefield 4 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, even with the settings cranked up. Clearly if that’s your resolution, this system is overkill, and only those with 1440p or 4K panels will be able to take full advantage – not uncommon for the price point. Of course, a large reason for these wins is that the Tiki and Chronos as we reviewed them had the GTX 980 Ti, as the GTX 1080 wasn’t available yet. They include options for the 10 series cards now, and that will easily put them on par with the G1. Power/noise/heat We’ve gotta hand it to the Predator. It manages to keep the volume down despite its small size. Systems with open grates, especially compact ones, can be quite noisy, but even under load the Predator G1 doesn’t break 41 decibels. That’s much quieter than the Chronos, which reaches 52.9 decibels with Furmark running. The system also stays cool all over, largely thanks to the GTX 1080’s Founders Edition blower design, which blows the hot air out the back – the only part of the system that’s hot on the exterior. Software Despite the premium price tag and gaming credentials, Acer packs the Predator G1 with all sorts of software you might not want. That includes CyberLink PowerDVD, Mozilla Firefox, and a slew of Acer’s first-party software. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends This includes the Predator Sense tracking suite, Acer’s proprietary software for monitoring system vitals and temperature. Unfortunately, it’s not well equipped, with just a view for the CPU’s current clock speed, and an option to leave the fans on auto or change them over to a set speed. Fans of more capable alternatives, like MSI Afterburner, will find the Acer solution woefully inadequate. Warranty Acer includes a two-year warranty with the Predator G1, which is a bit longer than we’re used to seeing on consumer systems. Unfortunately, it can’t quite match the comprehensive service plans that Origin and Falcon NW offer. For one, Acer requires you to pay all shipping to them for the duration of the warranty, while Falcon offers free overnight shipping for the first year, and Origin for the first 45 days — although Origin charges a bit more to extend the privilege. Acer also charges for phone support after the initial two-year warranty, where Origin and Falcon both offer 24/7 technical support for the product’s lifetime. Conclusion The Predator G1’s looks like a serious gaming powerhouse. But dig deeper, and it starts to feel like the G1 is built merely to be “good enough.” The Core i7-6700 is a strong chip, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the unlocked version found almost everywhere else. Whether due to power or thermal limitations, the GTX 1080 drags more than we expected. And for the moment, there’s only one configuration available, for $2,300. The DT Accessory Pack Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate Clicky MX Blue mechanical keyboard $166 Logitech MX Master wireless mouse $70 Steam Controller $42 That price puts the G1 well within range of the Tiki and Chronos. A similarly equipped Origin Chronos with an Intel Core i7-6700 will run you $2,510, with $111 bringing you up to the overclocked Core i7-6700K. The Tiki is admittedly more expensive at $2,972 for the i7-6700K version, but there are numerous advantages to both systems that the Predator can’t answer, including connectivity and upgradability. The Predator’s strong point, performance, is easily attributed to the newer graphical hardware, which its competitors didn’t have when we reviewed them. When you’re spending more than $2,000 on a system, you should be demanding quality at every turn. Yes, the G1 is a capable machine at 4K, and overkill at 1080p. But why settle? Acer’s small form-factor gaming rig compromises on key components without cutting costs, and focuses on form over function. Share

Elvis has left the building Just a quick note: I'm leaving Penton today, and this will be my last Short Takes. You can check out my Goodbye post on the SuperSite for Windows for more information, and please continue following me at thurrott.com, which goes live tomorrow, Saturday, January 17, 2015. The good news? The SuperSite for Windows will continue—as will Short Takes—under the aegis of the incomparable Rod Trent, arguably the hardest-working guy in technology reporting. Thanks to Penton for a terrific 15-year run. –Paul Google to halt sale of Google Glasses to consumers In what I can only describe as a wonderful "I told you so" moment, Google announced this week that it would stop selling Google Glasses to consumers this month, ending a years-long debacle. With this single most personally invasive device ever, Google was able to provide Google Glasses users with a truly unique experience: a 50 percent chance of being punched in the face every single time they walked into a bar. Priceless. "Microsoft fumes, Google discloses another Windows security flaw" Well, at least they didn't wait until right before Patch Tuesday. Oh. Right. If it quacks like a duck and looks like a duck... It must be the new Xiaomi Mi Note phablet. Which looks exactly like an Apple product—I think they prefer the term "inspired by" rather than "stolen from"—and has the same name as a similar Samsung product. You gotta give Xiaomi credit: They've really raised the bar on the notion of "cheap Chinese knockoff." "Google expects public in driverless cars in 2 to 5 years" I can't wait to race past these lookie-loos on the highway. Intel results confirm PC rebound in 2014, but firm warns on 2015 Intel delivered what can only be called a "good news/bad news" earnings report for Q4 2014 and CY 2014 this week, posting $11.7 billion in profits on $56 billion in revenues for the full year. The good news: Intel's PC business grew 4 percent in 2013, to $34.7 billion in revenues. The bad news? Only $4.2 billion of those revenues were in mobile devices, and that group posted revenues of "negative $6 million" in Q4, "consistent with expectations." Intel's inability to crack the mobile nut is well-established, but I find the firm's 2015 guidance to be even more troubling: Revenue growth in 2015 will still be stuck in "the mid-single digits." "Apple Says 1 Million Users Now Sign Up for iBooks Every Week" Every time this happens, a unicorn dies. Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe settle US poaching antitrust lawsuit I'm not sure why this wasn't a bigger story, but the federal government sued several high tech firms in 2011, alleging that they violated antitrust laws by conspiring to not hire each other's employees. This conspiracy—you won't be surprised to learn it was masterminded by the ever-innovative Steve Jobs—involved a number of companies, some of whom settled early on, though Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe originally declined to do so. Well, now they have to the tune of $415 million, or what Apple would describe as "a few pennies on the ground that are not worth the time to stop and pick up." So, way to go, federal government. You showed them! "Apple's Swift rockets up programming language rankings, jumps 46 spots" To position 22, behind such popular languages as Groovy, Clojure and Go. Meaning that absolutely no one uses it. Microsoft does the right thing, brings back the $350 Xbox One Were one to write a book called "Stupid Microsoft Decisions," there would be no lack of content, and indeed I could envision a multi-book series here. But among the most recent was the software giant's decision to lower the price of the base Xbox One to $350 during the holiday season—resulting in the console finally outselling the PS4 in the United States in both November and December—and then jack up the price again to $400 in January. I railed against this wrong-headed move in Microsoft's Next Big Mistake: Increasing the Price of the Xbox One, but less than two weeks later, they've come around the obvious: As of today, the base Xbox One is again priced at $350. But this is Microsoft, folks. This pricing is promotional and thus could end at any time. Cue sad trombone.wav. What I'll miss most about Penton Mostly, I'll miss the meetings. The seemingly bottomless expense account (which I never abused). The impossible-to-update web site CMS. And the email system, which I am still convinced was actively seeking out junk mail and depositing it in my inbox. But seriously, folks, what I'll miss most about Penton is the people: Rod, Marcia, Steve and the many coworkers and friends who preceded them. And you guys, of course. Thanks for letting me into your lives. –Paul  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 7 RyanGroom on Jan 16, 2015 I am still giggling to this comment: "Google expects public in driverless cars in 2 to 5 years" I can't wait to race past these lookie-loos on the highway.

Paul, thanks for all your hard work and your ability to both reveal the good things about Windows and other things Microsoft but not getting carried away like a fan boy. While many tech journalist and bloggers (I know you hate them) are immediately dismissive or hypercritical of Microsoft, you have wrote about what actually is happening. At this same time you have been very harsh - rightly so - regarding Microsoft's attempts. Good luck and see you on the other side. Log In or Register to post comments mtalinm on Jan 16, 2015 the applegoogleinteladobe poaching case was not a US government suit but rather a class-action by a SF law firm. the DOJ had stopped the alleged conspiracy years earlier, but there were no damages. so this law firm brought a class action suit. there has been a lot of coverage of the lawsuit. i think this latest episode got less coverage because it was the second settlement following the judge's rejection of the first settlement. a cynic might say that it was downplayed in the media because tech journalists love apple and google and/or are afraid to offend them. we can discuss more privately if you are interested.

Each employee potentially lost thousands of dollars from the pay increases they would have received. Plus each company would have given smaller pay increases and bonuses if they had no fear that employees would leave.

Hence the class action to asses the actual damages theoretically suffered by the class.

The thing unlike the Samsung products these phone do look like iphones so the suit will have validity. Good luck Xiaomi, you're flames will be bright. Its good to see the PC market getting stronger but to bad Intel can't hit it off in the mobile market. Maybe they should do an ARM processor. They've tried and tried to make x86 work but it just won't, power consumption is their achilles heel. Maybe when they get down to 14nm or maybe 7nm with ARM that might work but only time will tell. Also ARM has its roots in the mobile market, are handset and tablet developers going to want to switch? Can Intel make the price right? So many questions that can't be answered.

Dubbed Kaby Lake, the 7th-Generation Core processors should be of particular interest if you're making do with an older machine, like to stream a lot of high-resolution video or enjoy gaming on the go — or some combination of all three. During the Intel Developer Forum, we got a taste of what the 7th-Gen Core processors could do. During a demo at the forum, a Dell XPS 13 laptop was able to play the graphically demanding game Overwatch, using standard integrated graphics on the new platform. We've since reviewed the Kaby Lake XPS 13 and found its performance to be noticeably better. We now have a better idea of just how these CPUs will power the performance of an upcoming spate of notebooks, 2-in-1s and other computers. Here's what we know so far about Intel's 7th-Gen Core processors: 1. Core-powered machines are here. Chris Walker, Intel's general manager for mobile client platforms, said new processors from 4.5-watt to 15-watt will be the first to arrive, powering new 2-in-1s and ultrathin notebooks. Look for 100 designs featuring 7th-Gen Core processors to be available by the fourth quarter of 2016, Walker said. The new processor family will expand to other markets in January — specifically, enterprise, workstations, performance gaming and virtual reality, Walker said. That will mean more notebooks aimed at enthusiasts, as well as desktops with the 7th-Gen Core CPUs. 2. These chips have a familiar architecture. Intel built the 7th-Gen Core chips on the same Skylake architecture it introduced last year, so don't look for Intel to reinvent the architecture but rather refine it. Specifically, Intel said it improved the transistor channel strain on these CPUs. The result is a microarchitecture that's more power-efficient, so that the 7th-Gen Core chips can offer a performance boost over previous generations of Intel processors. 3. The Core m5 and m7 names are going away. Intel has made a change to the way it names its low-power chips, eliminating the Core m5 and Core m7 designations and turning those two 4.5-watt chips into Core i5 and Core i7-branded SKUs. The company hopes this change will help consumers, many of whom didn't understand the difference between a Core i5 and a Core m5. However, because the 4.5-watt CPUs, also known as Kaby Lake Y series chips, are lower-power, they won't perform the same as a U series 15-watt CPU. If you see a "Y" at the end of the SKU, you have one of the chips formerly known as Core m5 or m7. To make matters more interesting, Intel is keeping the Core M brand for its entry-level Core m3 chip, which is the slowest and least expensive of the bunch. So in order of performance, the 4.5-watt chips are named Core m3, Core i5 Y series and Core i7 Y series. 4. You'll see performance gains over last year's CPUs. You're probably not going to ditch that Skylake-powered machine you picked up last winter in favor of one with a 7th-Gen Core CPU. But Intel says that if you were to do so, you'll notice a faster machine. Using SYSmark to measure productivity, Intel found a machine powered by a 7th-Gen Core i7-7500U processor notched a 12 percent gain over a 6th-Gen Core i7-6500U CPU. That 7th-Gen-powered machine also recorded a 19 percent boost in web performance as measured by WebXPRT 2015. Obviously, the performance increases look more substantial when stacked up against older PCs, and that's where Intel is betting most of the upgrades to 7th-Gen chips are going to come from. A new Core i5-7200U-powered machine recorded a 1.7x improvement over a five-year-old Core i5-2467M in SYSmark. On the 3DMark Cloud Gate Graphics test, Intel said the new CPU tripled that five-year-old machine's score. Intel representatives told us that 7th-Gen Core CPUs could play Overwatch on medium settings at 720p with integrated graphics or at 4K with a compatible graphics amp. Kaby Lake won't kill gaming laptops, though, as hard-core players will want to play in 1080p at the minimum. 5. These chips are designed for video. Intel has taken notice of all of the 4K and 360-degree video we're consuming. In response, the chipmaker introduced a new video engine to its 7th-Gen Core processors that aims to handle whatever content demands you can throw at it. The new chips add HEVC 10-bit decode capability, which should let you play back 4K ultra-HD video without any hiccups. Intel also added VP9 decode capability to the 7th-Gen Core chips to boost power efficiency when you're watching those 4K and 360-degree videos while also performing other tasks. The chips will also create video content a lot faster. For example, according to Intel, you'll be able to transcode a 1-hour, 4K video in just 12 minutes. 6. The chips are more power efficient during playback. In terms of the battery boost you'll see, Intel said the 7th-Gen Core machine can last for 7 hours when streaming 4K and 4K 360-degree YouTube video, compared with the 6th-Gen Core processor's 4 hours of battery life when handling the same demands. As for 4K streaming video, Intel is promising all-day battery life, or 9 and a half hours with the 7th-Gen Core processors. 7. Intel looks to boost performance in other ways. The 7th-Gen Core processors offer a few other features aimed at making your laptops perform more efficiently, such as Intel's Turbo Boost 2.0 technology. That's the feature that manages both processor performance and power so that tasks get more processing oomph when they need it. Hyper-Threading Technology helps the CPUs complete tasks faster by delivering two processing threads for each core. The 7th-Gen Core chips also include Speed Shift technology, which should make for speedier apps. The technology allows a processor to more quickly settle on its best operating frequency, thus optimizing performance and efficiency. This pays off particularly when you're performing short bursts of activity, such as browsing the web. ✖ Laptop Guide Laptop Buying Guide: 8 Essential Tips The Best & Worst Laptop Brands Laptop Tech Support Showdown: Undercover Report Should I Buy a Chromebook?

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Intel launches new Apollo Lake silicon, but new Goldmont CPU architecture may draw significantly more power Intel launches new Apollo Lake silicon, but new Goldmont CPU architecture may draw significantly more power By Joel Hruska on September 2, 2016 at 9:30 am Comment Earlier this year, Intel announced that its next-generation Atom architecture, Goldmont, would be confined to netbooks and the low-end of the desktop market. Previously, Goldmont was meant to serve as the anchor for a new range of Intel products and offer the first architectural refresh since Bay Trail launched in 2013. Unlike Kaby Lake, which got the full launch treatment earlier this year, Goldmont has slipped out the door with almost no acknowledgment or briefing from Intel. Intel has added some features, including full hardware decode for VP9 and HEVC (though not HEVC Main10) support for the S0ix sleep state, Gen9 graphics (up from Gen8), and six PCI Express 2.0 lanes, up from four. The number of Execution Units (EUs) attached to the GPU is also up to 18, from a previous max of 16. As Anandtech details, however, these relatively modest advances come with a significant increase in TDP. Intel’s previous Atom processors had a TDP of 6.5W across the product stack, while all of the Airmont products unveiled today are 10W chips. That’s a significant jump for the new architecture, though it may not translate into higher power consumption at the wall (we’ll return to this shortly). Intel has previously positioned Apollo Lake as a cost-saving opportunity for the various OEMs, as the slide below makes clear: There may be good reason for this. Cutting prices is one of the few ways of encouraging end users to buy, even in a PC market where prices have been rock-bottom for a very long time. Chromebooks have also stolen a significant chunk of the overall market and Intel undoubtedly wants more of these systems to ship with x86 hardware instead of the ARM-based solutions some companies have shipped. Intel’s Gen9 GPU will support the DX12_1 feature set and offers its own memory stream compression, which should help overall performance, though systems at these price points are rarely useful for anything more taxing than a Facebook game. Intel is also claiming that Goldmont will offer a 30% performance gain on CPU and a 45% gain in GPU performance, though it didn’t offer any slides or details to back that claim up. We still don’t know what Intel changed or how Goldmont differs from Airmont — but this plays into the TDP considerations we mentioned above. Specifically, all of new Goldmont desktop CPUs in the Pentium J4 and Celeron J3 families have roughly equivalent clock speeds to the Airmont CPUs they replace, but are rated for a 10W TDP up from 6.5W for Airmont. The mobile Goldmont CPUs are all rated for 6W — but they also take a serious whack on base frequency, from 1.6GHz down to 1.1GHz. TDP (Thermal Design Power) is a complex topic and is generally defined as the typical expected power dissipation of a CPU in representative workloads. We don’t know how Intel sets its clock points within its workloads — how much of the total time is spent at max Turbo, how much at lesser speeds, and how much at the base frequency. What we do know is that the CPU base frequency can be thought of as a sort-of floor. Since Intel defines the base clock as the CPU clock you’ll get at all times unless the CPU is overheating, and since TDP is a metric that Intel gives heatsink and cooling solution manufacturers to target for optimal performance, we can safely assume that TDP is calculated to ensure the CPU doesn’t get hot enough to start throttling to protect its own operation. The fact that Intel has both bumped up the TDP rating on the desktop chips by 1.53x and cut the base clock on the mobile chips by 31% suggests that Goldmont may not have come out the way Intel was hoping it would. There’s enough play in these figures that Goldmont could still prove to be more power efficient than Airmont in certain workloads — again, we don’t know how Intel calculates TDP precisely, and if chips burst up to higher frequencies and complete workloads more quickly, the end result can be lower power consumption over time. We also don’t know if Goldmont is built on Intel’s 14nm process or the 14nm+ it used for Kaby Lake. Up until now, most interpretations of Intel’s decision to leave the smartphone and tablet markets have focused on the fact that Intel was still shipping products contra-revenue and was less interested in trying to buy its way into that space. To be clear, I think those were still major components of the company’s reasoning — but it’s also possible that Intel looked at how Goldmont was shaping up and realized that whatever the CPU’s merits in mobile and desktop processing, it wouldn’t be an architecture that could take the fight to ARM in smartphones and tablets.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 2, 2016 at 8:09AM A wafer of seventh-generation Core processors. Image source: Intel.  Eric Jhonsa, writing for The Street, recently argued that microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced seventh-generation Core processor family (which I'll refer to from here on out by the group's code name, Kaby Lake) is "the product of a cautious strategy that could backfire." What he's referring to specifically is the fact that Kaby Lake is the third generation of product built on Intel's 14-nanometer chip manufacturing. Jhonsa argues that Intel's new strategy "allows it to spread out capital investments for a given process over a longer time frame." He further goes on to say that Intel is "betting the cost savings that come from paring back its annual PC CPU and manufacturing investments will more than offset the narrowing (if not the narrowing) of its traditional technology leads" against key fabless chipmakers and their respective manufacturing partners. "It's a calculated gamble," he writes. "one that could easily start to backfire next year." I have a great deal of respect for Jhonsa and his work, but I disagree with him on this. Here's why.  Why Intel really shifted to this new strategy It's true that moving to new manufacturing technologies has become more difficult over time. Shrinking transistors and the associated metal stacks while keeping yields under control and moving performance up is hard and only getting harder. This is especially true as the industry as advancements in lithography tools have forced chip manufacturers to adopt increasingly exotic and expensive multipatterning schemes to build smaller chip features. This isn't a case of Intel paring back investments in chip technology research and development, nor is it a case of Intel wanting to wring more out of its capital investments. Rather, it's simply a case of Intel running into very difficult research and development challenges that force it to take longer to be able to get new manufacturing technologies into a production-worthy state. So, what's Intel doing about it? If Intel were simply just paring back investments in manufacturing technology as well as in chip technology, then the company would not have released Kaby Lake; it would have simply allowed the prior-generation Skylake parts to stay in the market for an additional year. Instead, the company did a couple of really interesting things. First of all, Intel went ahead and improved the 14-nanometer manufacturing technology that's used to build Kaby Lake. The company actually made real changes to the transistors as well as to the metal stack to wring out, according to the company, a full 12% worth of process-related performance improvement. Now, the changes done to the 14-nanometer process to create what Intel calls 14-nanometer+ don't just give a "free" performance boost. That is, Intel can't just take last year's designs, push a button, and have those designs roll off the line on the enhanced process. Instead, Intel had to go back and do quite a bit of work to the design to allow it to actually reap the benefits of this new manufacturing technology. All of this work ultimately led to Intel getting a product family out that delivers a good deal more performance in a given power envelope than its predecessor. Going forward, Intel isn't planning on letting up, either. The company says it will do three generations of products on its 10-nanometer manufacturing technology: 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++. I expect this new cadence to allow Intel to put out newer, more efficient, and better-performing products each year without the inherent unpredictability that trying to move to a whole new manufacturing technology generation (and failing) leads to. If anything, this new strategy put Intel in a better position to maintain performance/power leadership in key product areas (PC processors, server processors, and so on) going forward.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Making the news official alongside an Intel Kaby Lake upgrade for the slimline Blade Stealth, Razer is opening preorders immediately and anticipates delivering on them in October. There is no Intel 7th-gen option for the new Blade spec, owing to the lack of quad-core chips from Intel’s new architecture. Those will come later, and Razer is sure to tap them when they show up, but for now at least, the major spec bump is the new 1060 GPU, which Nvidia and Razer both promise makes the Blade "VR ready." I pressed Razer on the claim of VR capabilities for its new laptop, owing to the as-yet-uncertain performance of 1060-powered laptops in that category. Razer responded by saying that it’s confident the user experience will be a great one. "Are we scraping the bare minimum spec to get to VR? No." Beyond the Nvidia graphics chip, the new Blade model is equipped with Razer’s standard setup of a 6th-gen (Skylake) Core i7 CPU and 16GB of RAM, though the top storage option has now been doubled to a 1TB PCIe solid state drive. Also standard is the multimillion-color Razer Chroma keyboard backlight. Razer is adding a cheaper Full HD IPS matte display option, which takes the Blade’s starting price down to $1,799. Given the battery-saving advantages of a lower-res display without touch — the standard Blade panel is a Quad HD+ touchscreen — and the lower reflectivity without a glossy cover, I’d choose this option every time. The updated Razer Blade can be preordered today for delivery in October, which is when wider retail availability is expected as well.

Probably the most impressive change observed in the stats is in the rate of adoption of Windows 10 among Steam gamers. Windows 10 64-bit showed good gains in August, up by 2.77 per cent to 47.44 per cent. Add this to the 1.51 per cent of users with Windows 10 32-bit installed and you get 48.95 per cent in total. Please note that the free offer to upgrade to Windows 10 from other recent Windows OSes expired before August started. Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Zen only fully supported by Windows 10, and Linux Back in January we learnt that Microsoft won't support next gen CPUs in older Windows versions. In a blog post Microsoft spelled out that "Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel’s upcoming 'Kaby Lake' silicon, Qualcomm's upcoming “8996” silicon, and AMD's upcoming 'Bristol Ridge' silicon". However Microsoft abandoned a simultaneous policy change which would have meant a shortened life cycle for Skylake systems running Windows 7 and 8.1. So, earlier this week PCWorld got in touch with Microsoft, to check if the Windows 10 Kaby Lake / Zen policy is still in effect. A Microsoft spokesperson replied that "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support." In an explanation of the policy Microsoft said this narrower development focus allows "deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon". Further investigations by PCWorld revealed that both Intel and AMD will align themselves with Microsoft's software strategy. It isn't known what the result would be of a person making a new Kaby Lake or Zen based PC system, next year, then attempting to install and run Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. Sub optimal performance, glitches, or even crashes are all possibilities – and that would also depend upon the games/applications used in Windows. Windows 10 Anniversary Update freezing issue fixed In another bit of Windows 10 news this week, Microsoft has issued a fix for the widely reported Anniversary Update freezing issue. Though my system matched that of the commonly reported affected machine configurations I was unaffected by this bug. However it's good to see it fixed and the update was installed on my system last night. You can read about the issue and fix on Microsoft's Answers page, linked earlier in this paragraph.

Intel aren't about to release a processor that isn't as x86 compliant as the last goodness knows how many generations. They add new instructions but it's going to be a long time before a new architecture drops a feature that is critical for Windows to run. They're effectively suggesting you must run Windows 10 if you want a new CPU, rubbish. Although DirectX 12 is only available on 10, which is a good enough reason to (plan to) upgrade if you're a gamer. Posted by DanceswithUnix - Fri 02 Sep 2016 11:02 Dashers Although DirectX 12 is only available on 10, which is a good enough reason to (plan to) upgrade if you're a gamer. More a case of level of support. Before long every peripheral and software package will be targeting W10 primarily and vague attempts to support anything older if they even bother at all. Windows is a herd ecosystem, lord help the stragglers. Really, Windows is a lot of grief for a game launcher. Actually it isn't even that is it, it is a Steam/Battle.net/gog host so more of a game launcher launcher. Posted by Irien - Fri 02 Sep 2016 11:10 It is more likely to be related to the supporting motherboard/chipset, or graphics core. For example, try installing Win7 on a Skylake board and you'll have trouble with USB because everything runs through XHCI (typically associated with USB3), even the USB2! Whilst there are workarounds, I believe Intel have stopped (or are stopping) supplying graphics drivers for older OSs too, so Kaby Lake may only have GPU drivers for Win10 WDDM 2.0. They did this before with XP/Vista etc. Note - I think this attitude is really poor (it should be customer choice, not dictated by MS/Intel/AMD) but there's really little that anyone can do. For what it is worth, it's been a huge inconvenience to me personally because I still run a Windows Media Centre box for TV. With no WMC in Win10, that effectively blocks any upgrade path. For proper HEVC support/HDMI 2.0/HDCP 2.2 on iGPU, you'll want Kaby Lake, which creates a catch-22. I figure I'll just add a graphics card for that, but still, it creates a real problem.

They add new instructions but it's going to be a long time before a new architecture drops a feature that is critical for Windows to run. I'm going to take a guess that you missed the word “full” as no one is saying new processor won't run x86 instructions, however there's certainly unanswered questions over what other features in the new CPU's may not work on previous versions of Windows, and with both major CPU manufactures saying they're not going to release drivers for anything other than Windows 10 it's a wait and see moment, i wouldn't call that FUD, I'd call it prudence.

Intel veep Navin Shenoy holds up a Kaby Lake Core 2 Sep 2016 at 09:33, Chris Williams Water cooler I read an article this week headlined: "The latest Kaby Lake, Zen chips will support only Windows 10." It claimed Intel and AMD's new processors are "officially supported only by Microsoft’s Windows 10." This can't be true? What about Linux? Journalists, right? The short answer is Intel's Kaby Lake aka its seventh-generation Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, and AMD's Zen-based chips, are not locked down to Windows 10: they'll boot Linux, the BSDs, Chrome OS, home-brew kernels, OS X, whatever software supports them. So if you want to use Linux or some other non-Windows OS on your new CPUs, you'll be fine. It's OK, we checked. Sweet. What about Windows 7? Or Windows 8.1? Or any Windows pre-10? Yeah... nah. Shad Larsen, Microsoft's director of Windows business planning, blogged earlier this month: Future silicon platforms including Intel's upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) processor family and AMD’s 7th generation processors (e.g. Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10, and all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10. It's easy to misread that, which I suspect was intended, but Microsoft is just talking about Windows here. If you have a computer powered by a seventh-gen Intel chip or an AMD Zen CPU and you want to use Windows, Windows 10 is your only supported option. Intel spokesman Scott Massey told us, "per Microsoft's support policy, they made the decision that Windows 10 would be the only Windows OS supported on 7th-gen Intel Core" processors. He added: "The Microsoft support change obviously doesn't impact other operating systems." One example of Microsoft holding back support is the xHCI USB controller in sixth-generation Skylake and seventh-generation Kaby Lake: Windows 7 doesn't support that USB hardware, so installing the operating system from a USB stick using those chips is tricky. Intel provides xHCI drivers for Windows 7 once it's up and running. Why is Microsoft doing this? Windows 10 must succeed at all costs. It's Windows 10 or bust. If you're buying a flash new machine, what a superb way for Microsoft to shoehorn its latest operating system onto it; that'll really help inflate its usage numbers. And it'll make life easier for its engineers: there's less hardware to test and support, less code, fewer bugs, fewer problems for everyone. Yeah? Yeah, I'm sure that was mentioned, oh, at least maybe once or twice internally in a meeting, that's a ballpark figure. A Microsoft spokesperson told us: As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon. Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) silicon. Don't forget, though, Microsoft's repeatedly changed its mind on this sort of thing before. What, when? In January, Microsoft said it would only offer "security, reliability, and compatibility" fixes for Windows 7 and 8.1 on Intel Skylake processors until July 2017. After that cutoff point, only critical security updates would be made available – and only if they weren't a chore for Microsoft to develop and release. After some not-so-gentle persuasion by normal folks and IT buyers, Microsoft had a rethink: it extended the release of security, reliability and compatibility updates until July 2018. Then, for its commercial customers, it changed its mind again, and pushed that date back to January 14, 2020 for Windows 7 and January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1, when all extended support for the two operating system releases ends. Microsoft could make similar concessions for Windows 7 and 8.1 on Kaby Lake and Zen at some point. And Intel and AMD are cool with all of this Windows 10-only stuff? Yeah, weirdly, seems so. You'd think they'd want their chips used on the widest possible range of operating systems to maximize sales. On the other hand, if Microsoft is pulling the plug on Windows 7 and 8.1, perhaps the chipmakers can't be bothered updating and maintaining drivers for dead-end operating systems. Perhaps they want people to stockpile today's chips. A lot of this stuff tends to be backwards compatible, anyway. Just look at the ridiculous legacy-tangled mess that's the x86 boot process. No doubt people will find and document ways to run Windows 7 and 8.1 on the latest silicon from Intel and AMD, albeit with varying degrees of reliability. It's doable. They could port over drivers from Linux, for instance. Microsoft loves Linux! Right? Right. It really will hinge on how deeply Windows 7 and 8.1 depend on particular features within Intel and AMD's CPUs. Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, hinted earlier that Redmond's code in Win7, for instance, expects interrupts, power control and other hardware to be provided in ways that may differ in the latest chips: For Windows 7 to run on any modern silicon, device drivers and firmware need to emulate Windows 7’s expectations for interrupt processing, bus support, and power states – which is challenging for Wi-Fi, graphics, security, and more. As partners make customizations to legacy device drivers, services, and firmware settings, customers are likely to see regressions with Windows 7 ongoing servicing. How convenient? Yeah. You'd have to crack out the huge Intel and AMD reference manuals to compare the generations to see if anything really has fundamentally changed that much from, say, Skylake to Kaby Lake – and no doubt people will. I probably should. Usually what happens is you flip a bit in a control register to enable a new mode in a feature, say, a new way of delivering an interrupt to a driver. In this example, Microsoft is trying to argue that, on the latest chips, Windows 7 can't handle this new interrupt mode, and the processor won't support the old mode, so it'll have to be emulated by the firmware or some other low-level code, which is a chore. It's a plausible excuse and also extremely convenient for Microsoft in this instance. Basically, for now, don't buy an Intel seventh-generation Core nor an AMD Zen CPU if you want to keep running Windows 7 or 8.1.

How Rogue One's Imperial stormtroopers SAVED Star Wars and restored order More like this Intel Personal Tech The survivors: Intel's Apollo Lake netbook CPUs stagger from Goldmont bloodbath And into your Xmas stocking 2 Sep 2016 at 05:02, Chris Williams Amid the Kaby Lake noise this week, Intel slipped out six processors, codenamed Apollo Lake, for cheapo netbooks, tablet-laptop mutants and small PC boxes. These are 14nm low-power system-on-chips that use the x86 Goldmont architecture, and are branded Pentiums and Celerons. In April, Intel axed its Goldmont-based Broxton Atoms that were due to go into smartphones, and separately canned the Goldmont-powered Willow Trail Atom line that was aimed at tablets – but it allowed the netbook-friendly Apollo Lake family to live on. Therefore, here are the Goldmont-Apollo Lake survivors: Name Cores/Threads GHz GPU Max GPU MHz Max RAM Max Power Celeron N3450 4/4 1.1-2.2 HD 500 700 8GB 6W Celeron N3350 2/2 1.1-2.4 HD 500 650 8GB 6W Pentium N4200 4/4 1.1-2.5 HD 505 750 8GB 6W Celeron J3355 2/2 2.0-2.5 HD 500 700 6GB 10W Celeron J3455 4/4 1.5-2.3 HD 500 750 6GB 10W Pentium J4205 4/4 1.5-2.6 HD 505 800 8GB 10W The Pentium J4205, Celeron J3455 and Celeron J3355 are aimed at desktops, while the Pentium N4200, Celeron N3450 and Celeron N3350 are aimed at slabtops and netbooks. All of them have 2MB of cache, six PCIe 2 lanes, 12 to 18 GPU execution units depending on the model, LPDDR3 and LPDDR4 interfaces, and hardware decoding for H.264, HEVC, VP9, VC-1 and WMV9. The SoCs also have the usual builtin USB 2 and 3 controller, SATA ports, and so on. The kicker really is the included VP9 and HEVC/H.265 acceleration, allowing your battery-reliant device to stream high-def video from YouTube et al for longer before your charge runs out. Intel has had to down-clock its Apollo Lake CPU cores from the previous generation Braswell, also 14nm, to keep the power usage at a sensible level while integrating ninth-generation HD Graphics, the beefier video decoding, and other bits and pieces. Apollo Lake's max power consumption is 10W versus the 6.5W by Braswell, which uses eighth-gen HD Graphics. To make up for this reduction in frequency – down from the Braswell's 1.6GHz base – Chipzilla has had to pack various optimizations into the Goldmont architecture. According to SYSmark 2014 benchmark figures seen by Anandtech, the Apollo Lake N4200 is 30 per cent faster than the top-end Braswell N3710 in terms of CPU performance, and 45 per cent faster in terms of GPU performance. Given that there's a decent improvement, Goldmont is obviously doing something right to offset the drop in clock speed. You can expect these chips to appear in bargain-basement gear in time for the Christmas rush. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 6 Comments More from The Register Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Google gently leads Intel into its cloud: This is for your own good All is well, rejoice, rejoice, let's get into the white 'n' fluffy Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

But Kaby Lake isn't the only line of chips launched by Intel this week: Apollo Lake, designed for entry-level laptops and netbooks, has also been quietly announced. Apollo Lake is the latest SoC in Intel's Atom line-up, succeeding the Braswell platform. Built using new Goldmont CPU cores on a 14nm process, Apollo Lake will be the only current-generation Atom product on the market this year, as Intel cancelled both the Broxton and Willow Trail platforms (for smartphones and tablets respectively) several months ago. With Kaby Lake occupying mid-range and high-end markets, Apollo Lake sits in the entry-level with Pentium- and Celeron-branded SKUs. On the desktop, we're seeing three 10W parts priced up to $161, the most powerful being the Pentium J4205. There's also three 6W mobile SKUs, again priced up to $161.

Intel is expecting 30 percent better CPU performance and 45 percent better GPU performance than Braswell. Apollo Lake products will begin hitting the market in the coming months, although we haven't seen any announcements for products that integrate these processors just yet.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs revealed The first fruits of a new product cycle by Jeff Kampman  8:01 AM on August 30, 2016 Moore's Law may not be dead, but it is changing. In March of this year, Intel revealed that it would be adding a third stage to its traditional tick-tock model of technical advancement. That new model, "process-architecture-optimize," began its latest swing back in August 2014 with the Broadwell architecture, Intel's first time out with its 14-nm tri-gate process. A little over a year ago, we got our first taste of the Skylake "tock,"  which ditched the fully-integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) of Haswell and Broadwell chips and introduced Intel's Gen9 integrated graphics to the world, among other refinements. The Kaby Lake die, helpfully labeled. Source: Intel Now it's time for the "optimize" part of the 14-nm show. Today, Intel is raising the curtain on its Kaby Lake (or "seventh-generation Core") CPUs. We got a clearer picture of just what this third step in the new Intel architecture life cycle means at IDF a couple weeks back, so let's dive in. Getting the most out of the 14-nm process To improve Kaby Lake's performance, Intel says it's optimized its 14-nm tri-gate process so that it can lay down taller fins with a wider gate pitch. Intel calls this improved process "14-nm plus." Those improvements result in faster-switching transistors that are good for what Intel describes as "four or five speed bins" of extra clock speed, or about 400 to 500 MHz higher Turbo frequencies at the top end of a CPU's range. Kaby Lake CPUs will also be able to hit those peak speeds faster than before, thanks to an improved version of the SpeedShift technology that first appeared in Skylake. Where a Skylake Core i7-6500U might have needed over 20 ms to hit its peak Turbo speeds, a Kaby Lake Core i7-7500U might hit its Turbo peak in under 20 ms. When Intel talks about the "responsiveness gains" of Kaby, they're referring to these SpeedShift improvements. More efficient cat-video handling Along with the process improvements, the biggest change in Kaby Lake is to the integrated GPU's media encoding block. 4K video streaming, wider color gamuts, and HDR content are all in the pipe, and Intel wants to make sure its chips are ready to handle those demands efficiently. The company notes that for a lot of younger people, the 15" screen on their notebooks is the big screen they have ready access to, and it wants to offer mobile users the opportunity to watch 4K content without draining their batteries unduly. In addition to the 1080p HEVC (also known as H.265) encode and decode capabilities of Skylake, Kaby gets 4K HEVC 10-bit encode and decode support, as well as hardware decode support for YouTube's competing VP9 format. The Multi-Format Codec block in Kaby offers better support for wireless displays and an improved quality feature for the QuickSync Video Fixed-Function mode. In practice, these improved video functions let Kaby Lake CPUs play back 4K HEVC video much more efficiently than they would be able to if they had to rely on CPU power alone, as demonstrated by the local playback graph above. The Kaby CPU only needs to consume 0.5W to do its thing, compared to the 10.2W of the Core i7-6500U. For YouTube playback with VP9, the hardware decode capability in Kaby delivers similar improvements. The seventh-gen Core CPU only needs to consume 0.8W, compared to 5.8W with the CPU alone. What isn't changing We would normally perform a deep-dive on what else has changed under the hood of these Kaby Lake CPUs here, but aside from the enhanced video decode block and the benefits of the 14-nm "Plus" process, Intel was surprisingly frank about how little generation-to-generation differences there are between the sixth-gen and seventh-gen Core processors. Kaby Lake will use the same basic execution pipeline as Skylake before it, and the guts of its Gen9 integrated graphics processor are also basically identical to what arrived with Skylake. In conversations with Intel, I confirmed we're not getting any kind of FreeSync or VESA Adaptive-Sync support with this generation of chips, either. At least from a gamer's perspective, it's hard not to be disappointed by that fact. FreeSync monitors are becoming more and more widely available, and Intel is clearly thinking about the low-end gaming market to some degree. The company devoted a considerable portion of its demo time to showing off how well a thin-and-light Kaby Lake machine could play Overwatch, and I'd be willing to bet the gameplay experience would be even better with a variable-refresh display hooked up. Sadly, that's not to be with Kaby. We'll just have to wait another year to see whether Adaptive-Sync will land in Intel CPUs, it seems. The first Kaby Lake products Intel is revealing six Kaby Lake products today: three 4.5W "Y" CPUs and three 15W "U" CPUs. Instead of trying to explain the dizzying array of features inside each of these chips, I'm just going to post Intel's full accounting of what's inside. First off, let's look at the 4.5W family of seventh-gen Core products. These are all dual-core parts with Hyper-Threading enabled. As we might expect from Intel's description of its process improvements, the highest-end 4.5W Core i7-7Y75—seriously, take the naming responsibilities for these things away from the engineers, folks—can Turbo up to 3.6GHz, compared to 3.1GHz for the Skylake Core m7-6Y75. That's an impressive improvement, especially if Intel's Adaptive Performance environmental-monitoring tech lets the chip hang out at those higher clock speeds longer. You'll also note that Intel is using the Core i5 and Core i7 designators on its higher-end 4.5W CPUs now, instead of the Core m5 and Core m7 branding. Intel says it'll be reserving the Core m brand for low-end CPUs in the Kaby family, but it otherwise seems like we'll be seeing Core i branding from top to bottom in Intel's product range. My sense is that this move might make it harder to figure out which systems have which CPUs in the already arcane notebook market, but we'll just have to pay close attention from here on out.  The 15W seventh-generation Core parts all tell a similar story. The highest-end Core i7-7500U runs 200MHz faster than the Core i7-6500U at its base speed and 400MHz faster under Turbo-friendly workloads. The Core i5-7200U gets a 200-MHz base clock boost and a 300-MHz Turbo bump over the Core i5-6200U, and the Core i3-7100U makes do with a paltry 100-MHz bump over the Core i3-6100U. This cheapest 15W Kaby part doesn't do Turbo Boost. All told, these are nice improvements across the board for these meat-and-potatoes CPUs in Intel's lineup. Along with the improved media encode and decode features in Kaby, the bumped clock speeds should give Ultrabook-class mobile PCs a little more all-around muscle for the things that regular folks do with their PCs. Expect to see Kaby-equipped notebooks roll out beginning next month. What's next The six Kaby parts we're seeing today should cover a broad swath of mainstream PC needs, but there's more in store. Intel says to expect mobile CPUs with its higher-end Iris graphics and vPro management support to arrive in January 2017. We'll also need to wait until the New Year to see desktop parts benefiting from the move to Intel's 14-nm "Plus" process, as well. Intel remained mum about the chipsets and CPUs we can expect for the desktop at IDF, although we've seen hints of the 200-series chipsets as far back as Computex. It'll be interesting to see how Intel's 14-nm process improvements translate to the higher TDPs where enthusiast processors roam. If we can peer into our crystal balls for a moment, today's Kaby news might be most disappointing for Apple fans. The company's highest-end MacBook Pros rely on dual- and quad-core CPUs with eDRAM and Iris graphics on board, and those products are nowhere to be found in this first round of Kaby releases. Some MacBook Pros already feature Broadwell parts, but the highest-end quad-core MBPs still rely on Haswell Crystal Well CPUs. Unless Apple is intending to take the MacBook Pro in a more mainstream direction, we wouldn't expect to see updated versions of the company's highest-end laptop until next year, at the earliest. If that's the case, we'll have an exciting January to look forward to. 159 comments Email the author(s): Jeff Kampman Sign up to receive notices when we publish new articles Or go back to TR's front page Related Articles AMD crests Summit Ridge with Ryzen CPUs 365 AMD unwraps its seventh-generation desktop APUs and AM4 platform 81 AMD gives us our first real moment of Zen 411 Intel boosts the high-end desktop with its Broadwell-E CPUs 221 Intel's Core i7-6700K 'Skylake' processor reviewed 489 AMD's Carrizo brings power savings to mainstream laptops 83 Intel's Broadwell goes broad with new desktop, mobile, server variants 167 The TR Podcast bonus video: AMD, Zen, Fiji, and more 54 Tags: CPUs 159 comments View full site Copyright ©1999-2017 The Tech Report.

Gotta Be Mobile has the news. “PC maker Lenovo used this year’s IFA 2016 trade show to deliver a clear message to anyone who is considering purchasing a Windows 2-in-1 with a removable keyboard like the Surface Pro 4. If it’s money they’re trying to save, the Lenovo Miix 510 is the best Windows 2-in-1 with a detachable keyboard to purchase.” The article adds that for $599, you get a 12.2-inch display that supports touch and pen stylus input. Both the pen and the keyboard come with the device. It also has a USB-C port, a 4G LTE data connection, Intel Integrated 520 graphics, and an Intel Core M processor. There will be slightly more expensive options that offer an Intel Core i7 Processor. Engadget, who notes that the Miix 510 offers brisk performance without making your bank account weep, is also impressed with Lenovo’s Surface Pro 4 competitor, but notes some of its drawbacks. “It sports a lower-resolution display than the Miix 700 (1,920 x 1,200) and is both heavier (1.9 pounds without the keyboard attached) and thicker (0.39 inches), but it promises to be more powerful. You can have up to a 6th-generation Core i7 processor inside rather than a Core M, and up to a 1TB SSD.” The article adds that the Miix offers 7.5 hours of battery life rather than the nine hours Microsoft says it offers with the Surface Pro 4. However, anybody who has read the complaints about the Surface Pro 4 over the last year knows that Microsoft over-exaggerated its battery life a lot. Still, the Surface Pro 4 has set the standard in the industry, and there have been several attempts to create similar devices. The one that has come the closest has been the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S, which CNET gave four stars to. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S has received some good reviews. [Image via Daryl Deino]“The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S doesn’t do everything right, but its few missteps are in service of a greater good — providing a top-notch Windows tablet experience at a reasonable price. The overall value here is excellent, especially considering the advanced display and very long battery life,” said critic Dan Ackerman, who praised Samsung for including the keyboard cover with the device. A couple of things Ackerman didn’t like with the TabPro S is the fact that it comes with a sluggish Core M processor, and the keyboard cover allows only two screen angles, both of which may seem uncomfortable. Trusted Reviews wasn’t thrilled about the Core M processor either, but still gave the device four stars. “The Galaxy TabPro S remains one of the best Windows tablets around. The stellar screen and battery life make it a solid, albeit expensive, alternative to Microsoft’s ageing Surface 3 and it easily outclasses Huawei’s competing MateBook,” claimed columnist Alastair Stevenson, who — like others — can’t stop talking about the amazing screen. Besides the Miix 510 and TabPro S, there is also the Asus Transformer 3 Pro, which Digital Trends actually likes more than the Surface Pro 4. “Asus hasn’t made those mistakes [referring to other Surface Pro clones]. Its Transformer 3 Pro won’t win awards for originality, and we suspect some Surface owners will levy a few choice words at it for its imitation. That aside, it’s promising. It seems to nail the fundamentals; proper display size, thin design, and great keyboard. The Transformer 3 Pro and the Lenovo Miix 510 should hit stores within the next month or so. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5 likely won’t be released until 2015. One certainly has to thank Microsoft for creating the Surface Pro and inspiring other companies to create similar devices.

You get the choice of the dual-core M3, M5, or M7. It breaks down like this - the Core M3 is a 1.1GHz chip that Turbo Boosts to 2.7GHz. The M5 is 1.2GHz with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz. Finally, the Core M7, which is a built to order option, is 1.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz. Each model rocks the Intel HD Graphics 515 chipset, which is 25% faster than last years graphics chip. What’s interesting is that these models seem to be in Turbo Boost mode at almost all times. In fact, the M7 model is just about 4% slower than the previous-generation MacBook Pro in terms of processor speed, and that’s quite the surprise. FASTER FLASH STORAGE, RAM, AND GRAPHICS The second big change to the 2016 lineup is the inclusion of faster flash storage. This is the chips used to store your data on the MacBook. The new chips can do sequential reads of up to 1 GBps, which is 20% faster than the previous model. While a 20% read speed gain in great, even more impressive is that write speeds are 90% faster on the 2016 MacBook when compared to its predecessor. That’s a big deal, and means that when you are using the MacBook to get things done, you won’t feel the squeeze. The 2016 MacBook is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. The faster flash storage is paired with faster RAM as well - you get 8GB or 1867MHz DDR3 RAM, which is an increase from last years 1600MHz RAM. On top of that, there’s also the new Intel HD Graphics 515 chip, which Apple says increases graphics performance by 25%/ My main complaint with the 2015 MacBook is that it always felt like it was one step behind me, always trying to catch up to what I was doing, whether it was launching apps, or even the simple act of typing. With the new model, that issue has all but disappeared. ROSE GOLD Apple introduced the Rose Gold hue on the Apple Watch Edition - that was real Rose Gold. Then it brought Rose Gold colored aluminum to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus smartphone line. Shortly after, it brought Rose Gold to the Apple Watch Sport. A couple of weeks ago, the 9.7-inch iPad brought Rose Gold to Apple’s tablet line, and now with the 2016 MacBook, Apple brings the hue to its computers. From the outside, the 2016 MacBook looks exactly the same as the 2015 version, with the Rose Gold color being the only external choice that sets it apart visually. In some light the color looks more pink, in others it looks damn near close to the standard gold. It can even take on a copper color. Of course, if Rose Gold isn’t your thing, you can also pick up the MacBook in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray as well. CONCLUSION So, should you buy it? Ultimately, the 2016 MacBook feels like a much more capable computer than its predecessor. There’s always the waiting game you can play, which in this case would be waiting to see what Apple has up its sleeve for WWDC before pulling the trigger, just in case there’s a thinner, more powerful MacBook Pro around the corner. However, with the faster internal specs, the MacBook is capable of accomplishing those everyday tasks that you’ll want to throw at it, and this year it does it without complaining back at you by way of a multi-colored beachball.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews Jide Remix Mini review Hands on: Jide Remix Mini review Not yet rated By Desire Athow PC & Mac desktops  A smart little PC, just don't expect too much from it Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Should you buy the Remix Mini, be aware of its limitations – this is a £40 PC and no one should expect it to perform on par with one costing triple the price. For Wired Ethernet Value for money True desktop-like experience Against Capacitive touch button One USB 3.0 port would have helped The history of alternative operating systems is littered with dead bodies from big and small companies – from the mighty IBM and the mightier Intel to smaller corpses (Lindows anyone?), there have been dozens of companies trying to break the stranglehold of Microsoft back in the day, then Google's Android later on. Failure to do so could vaporise tens of billions of pounds off a company's value; Nokia and Motorola know a thing or two about that. Now, a small company called Jide is trying to challenge both Microsoft and Google with a little operating system called Remix OS. In reality, the latter is not an entirely new venture but is, in fact, based on Google's Android which is itself an open source project. We came across Jide and Remix OS a few weeks ago when reviewing the Onda OBook 10 SE (check the review for a bit more background) and this time around, Gearbest sent us a sample of Jide's very own take on the modern computer, the Remix Mini PC which is the product of a successful Kickstarter campaign. At just over £40 including delivery (around $52, AU$70), it is one of the cheapest mini PCs on the market, regardless of the OS, to offer 2GB of RAM. Note that if you're thinking of a purchase, we strongly advise you to read our article on the pros and cons of buying from Chinese retailers (and generally speaking, outside of the UK). The Remix Mini looks like a pebble from afar, with a curved body devoid of any edges as such. Black in colour, it comes with a 10W (5V2A) power supply unit and an HDMI cable as well as a couple of leaflets. There's a green status LED at the front, a pair of USB 2.0 ports on the back together with a full-size HDMI connector, an audio port, a microSD card slot and a 10/100Mbps Ethernet port. Our model came with 2GB of RAM and 16GB on-board storage. A cheaper variant with half the memory and half the storage is also available although we'd strongly advise you to avoid it. Both models come with a quad-core Allwinner system-on-chip based on ARM's Cortex-A53 technology and clocked at 1.2GHz. Because the device doesn't have an active fan, it ran a tad warm in operation; although not to any worrying extent. As expected, you get 802.11n Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 4.0. The Remix Mini supports 4K decoding but since it can only output at full HD, this won't matter much. Using the device was very intuitive – just plug in everything and switch it on by tapping on the Remix logo on top. Jide opted for a capacitive button which we disliked thoroughly as merely touching the logo would send the device to sleep. We updated the Remix OS to version 2.0.604 (based on Android 5.1) and there is an option to enrol in a scheme similar to Microsoft's Windows Insider program, allowing you to beta test the operating system. The update process took minutes rather than hours as some reported online, with a fairly straightforward setup. Compared to stock Android, Remix OS offers useful features such as native multi-tasking, a file manager, a taskbar, an option bar on the right, right click menu, shortcuts and a start menu that make it look more like Windows than anything produced by Google. Windows can be resized, minimised and maximised – snap to borders and Windows-based resizing shortcuts didn't work, though. Applications bundled included the usual suspects from Google (Play Store, Movies, Docs, Sheets, Gmail and Chrome) as well as a flurry of others from partners, one of which is Kodi. Performance was acceptable and, in a thin client configuration, would be more than adequate. Even on a full HD display, light web browsing or playing YouTube videos proved to be as intuitive as on an Android tablet, except you do it with a keyboard and a mouse rather than a touchscreen display. Early verdict Devices like the Remix Mini could transform Google's Android into a very cheap, almost free alternative to Windows for very small businesses that require internet access or operate mostly in the cloud. The fact that it can be plugged into most recent displays with an HDMI connector paves the way for some interesting configurations like powering a digital signage solution or a standalone kiosk. Having a wired connectivity option (hello Ethernet port) and no fans or vents does help as well. It's hard to fault the Remix Mini at this price – especially with the desktop experience – and the productivity aspect is particularly enticing if you are already using Google Apps, Microsoft Office Mobile or OfficeSuite. That said, Chrome OS is fairly similar to Remix OS – both are designed as 'desktopified' Android – and while devices running the former might not be as affordable as the Remix Mini, the fact is that you can go in a high street store and buy one like the Lenovo N22 Chromebook. For small businesses, there's also the appeal of having a company like Google providing support for Chrome OS rather than a much smaller company in a far, far away country.

pagetable.com Some Assembly Required Menu Skip to content Home About Emu8080: an HTML5 App to Emulate a Complete CP/M Machine 31 Replies by Stefan Tramm There are a lot of web-based computer emulators out there for ancient machines – the Commodore 64 and MSX home computers or the more exotic Space Invaders arcade machines. Such emulators are nice to play with but they are incomplete – they lack an Input/Output subsystem. Emu8080 is the first known Javascript-based emulator which adds a floppy disk system, a fast paper tape reader/writer, a line printer and a VT100 terminal emulator to the mix. Modern web browsers offer a local WebSQL database, which is used to implement block storage devices. Drag-and-Drop is used to mount a desktop file onto the virtual tape device. Together with CPU and RAM emulation, you have a complete machine inside your web browser… Want to try out? Use Chrome6+ (or Safari5) and visit http://www.tramm.li/i8080 Now you are working inside a classical machine monitor for an 8080 microcomputer from the 70′s. Available commands are: m to modify memory d to dump memory on the screen l to disassemble a program (in Z80 Syntax) g to start execution <Enter> to perform a single step x to show and modify CPU registers h for help So far this is pretty normal machine emulation. The first important command is “r”. Without any parameters, it lists the available files on the tramm.li server. “r file” reads an Intel HEX file into memory, for example “r basic” will load the well-known Microsoft 8K BASIC interpreter for the Intel 8080. But as already mentioned, a disk subsystem is also available. The first step in using it is to either insert a pre-formatted disk or to format an empty disk. To insert a pre-formatted CP/M disk, issue a “r 0 cpma” command. This command expects the image of an 8-inch IBM formatted SS/SD diskette and writes it sector-wise into the browser-local WebSQL database. This needs to be done only once, causing the disk to now be loaded into your browser as Emu8080 drive 0. With the “b” command, the boot sector is loaded into “main memory”, starting at address 0. Now issue a “g” command to start execution. Ta da!, CP/M 2.2 has been loaded and started! To go back to the monitor, you have two choices: Ctrl-. or via the “bye” executable. Emu8080 supports four drives, so you can either format the other drives (“F” command) or search for other images on the internet and load them yourself. But how do we mount these drives? The “dsk” commands comes to rescue. It opens a new window, showing the current status of each drive. Every disk is also a drop-area, so you can mount disk images per drag-and-drop from your desktop into the emulator. Technically the FileReader API of Javascript is used, and this API is currently (November 2010) implemented only by Chrome (or Opera). Yes, you do not need the server anymore to transport data into a Javascript application. Now you can mount disks and boot CP/M. You can edit files with ED.COM or Wordmaster, or write programs in 8080 assembler. But how to get the modified disk images out of the emulator again? The “dsk [n]” commands opens a new window, which allows to post the binary disk image to an arbitrary web server, e.g. localhost. (btw: there is no FileWriter API in HTML5). Just change the target URL and the form will post it where ever you want. Sometimes mounting and posting whole images is overkill, transmitting a single file into the CP/M machine or getting it out may be all you want to do. And here comes the emulated paper tape device to rescue. Just drag a file onto the terminal’s main window and it will be mounted. Inside CP/M, just use the PIP command: “pip file.txt=rdr:” and you will have the tape’s content in FILE.TXT. Please keep in mind that CP/M is not 8-bit clean. To get a single file out of the emulator, the paper tape puncher is used. Inside CP/M just use PIP again: “pip ptp:=rew.asm” to punch the file out. Then enter the monitor again (Ctrl-. or “bye”) and use the “ptp” command, which opens a window, where you either post the tape content to an arbitrary web server or simply copy-paste the content. The final device is a line printer. It just opens a separate window where every character is shown. No escape sequences are implemented – therefore no bold or underlined characters. In the unlikely case that the user has no clue about CP/M and its commands, the emulator includes a PDF of the original documentation by Digital Research. Now, lets take a short look into the technical details: WebSQL: The emulator uses the browser local SQL DB as block storage for the four disk drives. The storage is persistent and writable. Drag-and-Drop / FileReader API: The emulator uses drag-and-drop and the FileReader API to read paper tape or disc images from your local machine. HTML5 manifest: The emulator supports the browser local database and browser local file reading. To make it also runnable without an active internet connection, it is built as a HTML 5 App by providing an emu8080.manifest file. This file tells the browser which resources (HTML, JS, CSS, PNG, HEX, CPM, PDF files) must be cached. This means that if you bookmark http://www.tramm.li/i8080/emu8080.html, you can start the emulator and access the disk drives even without an internet connection — just like a local application. ShellInABox: Without the fabulous VT100 emulation of ShellInABox, this emulator would not have been possible. The provided example of a BASIC interpreter was the starting point for the 8080 emulator. z80pack: The C based implementation of a Z80 machine was the basis for the IO-subsystem implementation, the custom BIOS, and the boot disk image. The trick for reducing host CPU cycles in tight IO-Loops (eg. when CP/M is waiting for a key press) was taken from this package. js8080: The Space Invaders emulator js8080 gifted the core CPU emulation. One last word on performance. On a usual x86 processor the emulator performs like a 2 MHz 8080. With the monitor command “instr” you can tune the performance, by increasing the number of executed 8080 instructions per Javascript timeslice. With today’s hardware, you can expect the performance of a 8 MHz CPU (which was never available as real silicon). And for Microsoft BASIC fans, try “r basic” and “g” afterwards instead of booting CP/M – welcome to 8K BASIC. Use “SAVE” to save your programs on the paper tape and “LOAD” to read saved programs. Neozeed provided the Zork adventure game disk image. And now — happy hacking. http://www.tramm.li/i8080/ http://www.tramm.li/i8080/emu8080.html Other links: Neozeed blogged about the emulator, he also provides a very clear Howto, please take a look at: http://virtuallyfun.blogspot.com/2010/10/cpm-zork-in-java-script.html Emu8080 is also mentioned on the Z80 Info Pages (many thanks to Gaby from gaby.de for the reference!): http://www.z80.info/z80emu.htm#EMU_CPU_VAR This entry was posted in archeology, hacks on November 14, 2010 by Michael Steil.

Parity indicates if the number of set bits is even or odd. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_flag). The js8080 implementation indicates if the number itself is even or odd. Counting bits in JavaScript can be a bit slow.

Intel Kaby Lake & AMD Zen - Beschränkung auf Windows 10 wegen neuer Features Die neue CPU-Generationen Kaby Lake und Zen werden von Intel und AMD unter Windows 7 und Windows 8.1 nicht mehr durch neue Treiber unterstützt. Von Georg Wieselsberger | Datum: 03.09.2016 ; 08:40 Uhr Kommentare (91) AMD Zen und Intels Kaby Lake werden von den Prozessorherstellern keine Treiber für Windows 7 und Windows 8 erhalten. Update: Laut Hothardware sind spezielle Energiespar-Funktionen in Intels Kaby Lake und die Verarbeitung von zwei Threads pro Kern bei AMDs Zen die Gründe dafür, dass die neuen Prozessoren wohl nur unter Windows 10 offiziell unterstützt werden. Die Speed-Shift-Funktion von Intel ist bereits in den aktuellen Skylake-CPUs wie dem Core i7 6700K enthalten und funktioniert ebenfalls nur unter Windows 10. Kaby Lake wird eine verbesserte Version dieser Energiespar-Funktion bieten. AMDs Zen-Prozessoren können pro Kern zwei Threads verarbeiten, doch laut dem Bericht ist diese Funktion nicht identisch mit dem ähnlichen Hyper-Threading von Intel, die auch in älteren Windows-Versionen funktioniert. Um die neuen Funktionen von Kaby Lake und Zen verwenden zu können, müssen diese aber auch durch den Betriebssystem-Kernel unterstützt werden. Bei Windows 7 hatte Microsoft für die AMD Bulldozer-Prozessoren noch ein Update bereitgestellt, um den Windows-Kernel für dessen neue Funktionen zu optimieren. Da Microsoft aber aktuell nur noch Windows 10 mit neuen Funktionen ausstattet, wird auch nur noch diese Windows-Version für die neuen CPU-Generationen optimiert. Allerdings sollten laut dem Bericht keine Probleme auftreten, wenn die neuen Prozessoren beispielsweise mit Windows 7 genutzt werden. Windows XP funktioniert auch heute noch mit einer Skylake-CPU, auch wenn viele Features des Prozessors dann ungenutzt bleiben. Quelle: Hothardware Originalmeldung: Vor einigen Monaten hatte Microsoft angekündigt, dass die älteren Betriebssysteme Windows 7 und Windows 8.1 keine Unterstützung mehr für neue, zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht veröffentlichte CPU-Generationen erhalten werden. Damit waren von dieser Ankündigung sowohl die kommenden Zen-Prozessoren von AMD als auch Kaby Lake von Intel betroffen. Als Grund hatte Microsoft unter anderem angegeben, dass Features der neuen CPUs tiefer in das Betriebssystem integriert werden sollen und das bei älteren Versionen aufgrund des unterschiedlichen Aufbaus nicht möglich sei. Microsoft war für diese Entscheidung stark kritisiert worden, doch nun sieht es so aus, als seien die Prozessor-Hersteller zumindest daran beteiligt. Wie Intel gegenüber PC World bestätigt, wird es für Kaby Lake aufgrund der Entscheidung von Microsoft keine neuen Treiber für Windows 7 und Windows 8 geben. Auch der Technik-Chef von AMD, Mark Papermaster. hat auf Anfrage bestätigt, dass die Roadmap des Unternehmens komplett mit der Software-Strategie von Microsoft abgestimmt ist. Damit scheint nun sicher, dass die neuen Prozessoren beider Hersteller keine Windows-7/8-Treiber mehr erhalten, allerdings ist nicht klar, was das für Nutzer der älteren Betriebssysteme bedeutet. Im besten Fall funktionieren auch die neuen Prozessoren wegen des x86-Standards an sich problemlos, können aber einige neue Features unter Windows 7 und Windows 8 nicht nutzen. Allerdings könnten auch dann noch Probleme mit neuerer Software auftreten, die mit der nicht unterstützen Kombination aus altem Windows und neuer CPU nicht zurechtkommt. Intels Skylake-CPUs wie der Core i7 6700K sind damit die letzte voll unterstützte CPU-Generation unter Windows 7 und Windows 8. Laut AMD bezieht sich die Aussage von Mark Papermaster übrigens nur auf Windows und nicht auf Linux oder macOS.

Sep 2016, 09:14 Da bin ich jetzt echt gespannt, welche "neuen Killer-Features" es sein werden, die Intel und AMD in die neuen Prozessoren einbauen und ob diese für das tägliche Arbeiten und Spielen am PC wirklich wichtig und von Software-Entwicklern dann auch unterstützt werden ;-)  (11)  |   (9) Tidaltree #3 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:18 Dann heißt es wohl abwarten, welche neuen Features das sind, die nicht funktionieren werden, und ob man auf diese auch verzichten kann. Zudem kann die Behauptung, daß diese Funktionen bei älteren Betriebssystemen nicht integriert werden könne, eine reine PR-Behauptung darstellen, um die Verbreitung von Win1['m]0[ut] zu befördern. Kreativen Codern mag es ja durchaus noch gelingen, Selber einen Treiber für Win7/8 zu programmieren, der diese Funktionen lauffähig integriert.  (13)  |   (12) TheSam #4 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:28 Naja, wenn man bedenkt wie wenig sich die CPUs in den letzten Jahren seit dem 2500k weiterentwickelt haben, dann kann man damit gut leben und kauft sich zur Not eben nochmal einen Skylake und kann den noch vollumfänglich ein paar Jahre nutzen, bis man irgendwann selbst auf ein neues OS wechseln will.  (26)  |   (9) EvilKenivel1976 #5 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:31 Das werden bestimmt irgendwelche neuen Energiesparoptionen sein. Da ich eh immer alles auf Leistung stelle würde mich das nicht interessieren. Naja und außerdem gehöre ich zu den 22% die Windows 10 benutzen ^^  (19)  |   (14) Agent.Smith #6 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:45 Zitat von : Auch der Technik-Chef von AMD, Mark Papermaster. hat auf Anfrage bestätigt, dass die Roadmap des Unternehmens komplett mit der Software-Strategie von Microsoft abgestimmt ist. Und wer ist denn nun auf wen zugegangen und hat um diese Abstimmung gebeten? Ich mein, gerade AMD kann doch gerade echt jeden noch so kleinen Wetbewerbsvorteil gebrauchen. Und Treiber für eins der (noch) verbreitetsten Betriebssysteme überhaupt ist nun sicher kein kleiner Wettbewerbsvorteil. Ich kann nicht so recht glauben, dass gerade AMD so völlig freiwillig und ohne "Motivation von außen" darauf verzichtet hat.  (27)  |   (6) Tigerchen85 #7 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:50 Zitat von Agent.Smith: Ich kann nicht so recht glauben, dass gerade AMD so völlig freiwillig und ohne "Motivation von außen" darauf verzichtet hat. AMD hat im Prozessor Markt einfach nichts mehr zu melden. So einfach ist das. Die Big Player sind nunmal INTEL und Microsoft (im Software Bereich). AMD kann sich fügen oder es lassen, aber es wird sicher nichts ändern.  (7)  |   (33) Agent.Smith #8 | 03.

AMD kann sich fügen oder es lassen, aber es wird sicher nichts ändern. "Sich fügen" sieht so aus als wären sie gezwungen worden und nicht "motiviert" durch Geld oder Zusagen. Ich glaube es war eher Letzteres.  (6)  |   (7) Eris #9 | 03. Sep 2016, 10:05 Ich kann euch jetzt schon sagen, dass da vielleicht ein sinnvolles Feature dabei sein wird und der Rest nur zur Verdongelung (was für ein Wort :)) des PC´s dient. Natürlich läuft das Ganze dann wieder unter dem Aspekt "Sicherheit für den Endkunden".  (5)  |   (6) Tidaltree #10 | 03.

AMD kann sich fügen oder es lassen, aber es wird sicher nichts ändern. Wenn da mal nicht die Geheimdienstinteressen eine Dominanz im Verhandlungsverlauf eingenommen haben ... Ist ja vielleicht auch eine Sache für das Bundeskartellamt. Wäre gespannt darauf, was Die von dieser Abstimmung zwischen Hard- und Softareunternehmen halten würden. Win10-Umstiegsunwilligen Kunden stünde da ja auch noch eine rechtliche Prüfung auf spürbare Beeinträchtigung durch unsachliche Beeinflussung offen [§3;§4 UWG].  (9)  |   (11)  Nach oben 1 2 3 ... 9 weiter » Nur angemeldete Benutzer können Kommentare bewerten. » Zum Login | » Zur Registrierung Soll dieser Kommentar wirklich gemeldet werden?

Unfortunately, the chipset believed to be included in the upcoming MacBook Pro isn’t noted. What gives? There are three new Kaby Lake processors: the ‘U’ series, ‘Y’ series and ’S’ series. The U is best suited for the MacBook Air, which is believed to be seeing a refresh soon. 30,000 tech-heads descend on Amsterdam Join us and 30,000 others at the 12th edition of TNW Conference. Explore our speakers and attendees now. TELL ME MORE! The ‘Y’ is a bit tighter, and a good fit (pun intended) for the Macbook. Intel’s ’S’ series processor — the one many believe will be included in the Macbook Pro — hasn’t been detailed. But Intel’s new chipsets are beastly. It says Kaby Lake architecture provides 19 percent better performance for Web browsing compared to Skylake, and 12 percent gains overall. Intel also says you’ll get nearly 10 hours of 4K video playback, and processing a 4K video is up to six times faster than with existing chipsets. This doesn’t mean the Pro won’t have Kaby Lake, or that it’s delayed beyond the original timeline. Really, we don’t know when the Pro is actually coming, though it’s widely believed Apple will announce it in October. 7th Gen Intel Core on Intel Read next: Skip iTunes entirely and browse Apple's mobile App Store from the browser IntelMacBookMacBook Pro Share on Facebook (27) Share on Twitter (142) Nate Swanner is a reporter from Portland, OR, US.

Intel Hits 52-Week High on Strong Growth Prospects Zacks Equity Research 9/2/2016 Zacks Equity Research © Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The Intel logo is displayed outside of the Intel headquarters on January in Santa Clara, California. Shares of Intel Corp. INTC touched a new 52-week high of $36.04 on Sep 1, eventually closing at $36.02. The company returned 23.9% in the past one year and has added roughly 4.6% year to date. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was approximately 21,619K. What's Driving Intel? Intel is one of the world’s leading producers of semiconductor components and digital platforms. Its focus was earlier on making the best computing chips and generating industry-leading margins from them. Now, Intel’s focus has shifted to a product range targeting different segments of the market, namely data center business, cloud and IoT. In particular, Intel’s data center business and cloud have been registering significant growth. In this regard, the company recently said that it is acquiring Nervana Systems, an artificial intelligence startup based in San Diego. This deal will help Intel to enhance its prowess in data center as well as machine learning, which is gradually gaining prominence. Another growth driver is the company’s recently launched 7th generation CPU –14nm Kaby Lakechip. Kaby’s biggest feature is improved support for 4K, which is likely to be a big positive going forward. Just like both Broadwell and Skylake, Kaby Lakechip comes with improved graphics performance, better CPU performance and longer battery life. Also, the price appreciation may be attributed to Intel’s strong fundamentals, solid growth of its cloud business and better-than-expected second-quarter 2016 results reported on Jul 20. In the second quarter, Intel reported earnings of 59 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents. The increase was driven by better operational efficiency and cost cutting measures. However, Intel’s revenue of $13.53 billion was within the guided range of $13.5 billion (+/-$500 million) but below the Zacks Consensus of $14.80 billion. Also, management provided a solid guidance for the third quarter of 2016. Revenues are expected at around $14.9 billion (+/-$500 million), up 10.1% sequentially and 3.0% from the June quarter of 2015. In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 7.95%. Intel’s strong revenue growth, solid financial conditions, growth in areas like cloud computing, mobile, data center as well as strong long-term growth potential position it favorably. Intel’s strong revenue growth, solid financial conditions, growth in areas like cloud computing, mobile, data center as well as strong long-term growth potential position it favorably.

Using a special camera technology from Intel called RealSense, Windows Hello can scan and then recognize your face using three cameras (Color, 3D and Infrared) to provide you a secure means of access not only to your Windows 10 machine but also apps and websites. No further proof is needed about the popularity of a feature like this then our video last year that demoed Windows Hello and its facial recognition for the first time outside of Microsoft. That video has been viewed over 143,000 times and is still the number result when you search YouTube for a "windows hello facial recognition demo". You would think with that kind of desire for this cool and secure feature that third party camera peripheral manufacturers such as Logitech and even Microsoft would have jumped on this early and fast. Well it did not happen. Instead, Intel was selling so many of their RealSense DevKit cameras that they were regularly running out of stock and having to build more. Still, no third party manufacturers noticed. However, new devices such as laptops, tablets and phones started to trickle into the market and slowly put the Windows Hello facial recognition feature at more users disposal but that meant buying a new device to get the capability. What about everyone who already owned a desktop or laptop computer and just wanted to add facial recognition with Windows Hello? Well, in the last nine months only two manufacturers have announced their intentions to finally bring third party cameras to market that support Windows Hello. One was Razer's Stargazer (announced at CES 2016) and the other one was from MouseComputer (revealed at COMPUTEX 2016). While nothing has been heard about the MouseComputer camera since early June, this week at IFA 2016 in Berlin Razer announced that their Stargazer is now available for pre-order and according to the product page at the Razer online store it begins shipping on 21 September 2016. The USB 3.0 camera fully supports Windows Hello as expected but is also a full HD 1080p webcam with several other features: Ultra-high 60 frames per second capture optimized for streaming (720p max) Max 1080p HD video capture Automatic noise cancelling dual array mic Dynamic Background Removal 3D scanning Facial/gesture recognition Flexible clip for laptops and desktop monitors The product specifications, in other words what your PC needs to have to support this device, looks like this: 6th generation Intel® Core™ processor PC with a free USB 3.0 port 8GB of free hard disk space DirectX 9.0 Intel® HD graphics Windows® 10 4GB memory Internet connection One note. The specs list that an Intel 6th generation processor is needed, this is the same requirement listed for the Intel RealSense DevKit camera however, I have been using the Intel developer kit camera on my AMD based system without any issues at all. The only time it has not worked was when I attempted to use it with a USB 2.0 port - it really does need the USB 3.0 for the higher speed and bandwidth. I have already pre-ordered one of these Stargazer's from Razer and will share more about the device with you once it has arrived.   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Related Media Unboxing and Setup of Amazon Echo Dot Lenovo Updates Its ThinkPad Lineup Just Prior to CES 2017 AUKEY 20000mAh 3.4A Dual USB Lightning and Micro AiPower Portable… Inateck In-Ear Sport Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds Inateck Phone Car Mount and Holder Unboxing & Hands On : Nuvision TM800W610L 8-Inch Windows 10… Review: WaterField Designs Syde Surface Book Case Inateck Wireless Bluetooth Receiver and Hands-Free Car Kit Review: Masione USB Wired Gaming Keyboard Inateck Wireless Presenter, 2.4GHz PowerPoint Remote Control Please Log In or Register to post comments.

It has a beautiful, high-resolution display, a stunning chassis that’s both thin and light, Thunderbolt 3 with USB Type C connector, and can support an external desktop GPU via Razer Core. It did, however, use an Nvidia 9 Series mobile GPU for graphics at a time when a new generation was just around the corner. Today the company is refreshing the Blade with a Pascal-based GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card and a new 1TB storage option. Razer claims the GPU upgrade should offer a performance increase of more than 40% compared to the previous generation. There is no Intel 7th generation option as there are no mobile quad-core Kaby Lake chips yet. Starting at $1,799 for the 14” Full HD (1920 x 1080) matte display option and $2,099 if you opt for the QHD+ (3200 x 1800) IGZO panel, the Razer Blade comes standard with a Skylake Core i7-6700HQ processor with Intel HD Graphics 530, 16GB of DDR4 dual-channel memory, the aforementioned GTX 1060 and a 256GB SSD. Other than that the 14-inch Razer Blade is pretty much the same great thin gaming laptop, with the same colorful Chroma keyboard and 70 watt-hour battery. The updated Razer Blade can be preordered today for delivery in October. Razer is also updating the Blade Stealth, the company’s first ultrabook which made its debut at CES in January. Headlining the new changes is a new 7th generation 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U processor with Intel HD 620 graphics and a larger battery that should provide up to 9 hours of usable battery life according to the company. The base model starts at $999 and comes with a 2,560 x 1440 QHD IGZO touch display, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, but now you also have the option to get twice as much RAM, and up to 512GB of solid state storage. A 4K variant is also available priced at $1,599 with a 512GB SSD or $1,999 with a full terabyte of solid state storage. Although the Blade Stealth is billed as an ultrabook and not a gaming powerhouse on its own, it is also compatible with the Razer Core external GPU housing via Thunderbolt 3.

The next generation of multi-touch allows users to dip in and out of content without losing their place. User's simply press lightly to Peek at a photo, email, web page or other content, and press a little deeper to Pop into the content itself. Apple filed for their trademark on the day it was announced, September 9, 2015.         Apple's Peek and Pop RTM was filed under International Class 009 covering the following description:   "Computers; computer peripherals; computer hardware; hand held computers; tablet computers; handheld digital electronic devices capable of providing access to the Internet and for the sending, receiving, and storing of telephone calls, electronic mail, and other digital data; mobile phones; wireless communication devices for voice, data or image transmission; computer software; computer software for use in connection with hand held computers and tablet computers; computer software for setting up, configuring, operating and controlling mobile devices, mobile phones, computers, and computer peripherals; computer software for accessing, monitoring, searching, displaying, reading, recommending, sharing, and organizing news, sports, weather, commentary, and other information, content from periodicals, blogs, and websites, and other text, data, graphics, images, audio, video, and multimedia content; computer software for use in manipulating, and reviewing text, data, graphics, images, audio, video, and multimedia content."   Next week Apple will introduce the iPhone 7 that is bound to introduce new software and hardware features that will carry new trademarks. One of the new ones will likely be for their next-gen 3D iSight camera. Any guesses for what they'll call it?

As always, we’ll be covering the latest in Apple’s big fall refresh thoroughly here at iDB. Of course, the iPhone 7 will be the event’s biggest story, but we’re also hoping to see other hardware refreshes, accessories and related products come into full view next Wednesday. Here’s everything we think Apple could introduce come September 7, plus some of the things we’d like them to announce but they probably won’t (yet). iPhone 7 Expectations for Apple’s iPhone refresh are tepid as the forthcoming phone appears to be an incremental upgrade versus the iPhone 6s. The biggest visual difference: updated antenna lines on the backside, now visible only at the top and bottom edges of the device. Aside from the subdued antenna seams, the iPhone 7 is thought to borrow the industrial design that Apple has used for the past two years, making the new phones virtually indistinguishable at first glance from the iPhone 6/6s design. On the inside, however, the iPhone 7 is said to pack in more improvements than meets the eye. An Apple-designed ‘A10’ system-on-a-chip fabbed on TSMC’s ten-nanometer process will speed up CPU and GPU performance versus last year’s A9 chip inside the iPhone 6s, while consuming less power. Furthermore, the A10 will probably integrate an embedded ‘M10’ motion coprocessor that may for may not draw less power in ‘Hey Siri’ mode while potentially powering new tracking features. The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is said to include two gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM (like the iPhone 6s) while the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus could use three gigabytes of RAM due to its dual-lens camera processing more data. Both phones may come with a slightly larger earpiece and relocated proximity sensor. The new phones are said to be outfitted with stronger batteries. That said, it’s unclear if more juice will equal extended run time but even the modest improvement in that regard will be much appreciated. The iPhone 7 range should have the same display resolution as Apple’s current Retina and Retina HD screens on the iPhone 6/6s and iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus. The back cameras are said to be better, with the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus getting a dual-lens camera system allowing for better low-light performance and features like true optical zoom and more accurate colors while the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is said to gain optical image stabilization. For what it’s worth, we’re not expecting any increase in megapixels, but that protruding lens should be more bearable thanks to the cameras’ curved design. Both phones are thought to have a non-moving digital Home button with haptic feedback. The headphone jack is widely expected to disappear from the next iPhone—but, it’s not clear whether or not the removal of the 3.5mm analog audio port paves the way for stereo speakers. Even without the 3.55mm jack, the iPhone 7 will support Bluetooth headphones and wired ones based on Lightning I/O. Dubious iPhone 7 packaging photos have indicated that the handset could ship with a wireless version of Apple’s EarPods, likely to be called AirPods Wireless Earphones, and a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter so that folks can connect their “legacy” headphones to the iPhone 7 without buying a standalone adapter. We believe the phones will start out at 32 gigabytes of storage as Apple finally kills off the oft-criticized 16GB iPhone tier. A model with 256 gigabytes of storage is in the cards, too, providing twice as much on-device storage versus current 128GB iPhones. When it comes to the finishes, some new colorways might join, or replace some of Apple’s current Gold, Rose Gold, Silver and Space Gray options. These might include a Darth Vader-like Glossy Black and either a Deep Blue or an Apple Watch Space Black-like Space Black colorway. The Cupertino firm should begin taking pre-orders for the iPhone 7 on Friday, September 9, with shipments probably commencing two weeks later on September 25. As is Apple’s won’t, we’re not expecting a price increase for the new iPhones: the iPhone 7 should cost the same as the iPhone 6s. And by the time the latest iPhones arrive, the iPhone 6s and older models (but not the already affordable iPhone SE) should see their prices slashed. Apple Watch 2 It’s been nearly a year and a half since the original Apple Watch debuted in April 2015 so it’s obvious that Apple’s wearable is not on the same annual refresh cycle as iPhones and iPads are. Be that as it may, we think the September 7 event could also serve as a launchpad for a second-generation Apple Watch 2—more so given the Apple Watch 2 will still require an iPhone to function. Most of use here at iDownloadBlog are in agreement that the Apple Watch 2 will run Apple’s ‘S2’ chip built on TSMC’s 16-nanometer process, have a thinner and lighter display and a bigger battery potentially giving it a few more hours of run time. We’re also pretty sure the gizmo will be more waterproof than the original device, track swimming and provide more accurate workout readings without its paired iPhone thanks to the included GPS. New sensors (like barometer for improved elevation and geolocation capabilities) could also be in the offing. There are some things we think didn’t make the cut for the second-generation refresh of the Apple Watch, namely such features as a built-in FaceTime camera (who cares? videoconferencing from the wrist doesn’t seem like a must-have feature), a sharper screen (it’s already sharp) or LTE connectivity (because cellular data transfers deplete most tiny smartwatch batteries far too quickly). Some new bands in a plethora of colors/materials, you say. Definitely possible, we say. If you believe analysts, the original Apple Watch could also be updated with a faster S2 chip and slightly improved waterproofing, but don’t expect any visible changes to its form factor or appearance. iPads Reports of the iPad’s fall refresh are inconclusive and sketchy, at best. Some sources have called for a second-generation iPad Pro along with a third-generation iPad Air in September. Others have claimed that Apple won’t be updating its tablet lineup before 2017. As there has been virtually no iPad-related leaks in the past few months, it is our speculation that any new iPads would deserve a separate event in October (less likely) or in Spring 2017 (definitely more likely). For what it’s worth, perhaps the most reliable Apple analyst out there, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, recently predicted that 2017 will be the year of a brand new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model, a second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad. New Macs Most of the Macs sold, especially the three-years-old Mac Pro, are ripe for a refresh. We think there’s a reasonable likelihood that we’ll see some new Macs announced at the iPhone 7 presser. That’s mainly due to some solid sources stating Apple no longer wishes to hold two events in the fall—iPhones in September, with iPads, Macs and other related hardware like the Apple TV in October. No matter how you look at it, Apple will disservice fans by delaying new Macs into 2017. The key issue potentially holding back new Macs: Intel. As the world has witnessed, Skylake chips have been plagued with reliability issues related to overheating so good thing Apple hasn’t bet on the SkyLake platform. Earlier this week, however, Intel announced first Y and U-series chips based on a seventh-generation Core architecture code-named Kaby Lake. These new chips would be perfect for Mac notebooks and iMacs (their desktop counterparts won’t be available in volume until 2017). Due to these uncertainties and Intel’s increasingly unreliable roadmap, we really cannot predict whether new Mac hardware built around these processors could get unveiled this or next month, or in 2017. If you asked us to speculate, we’d say Apple could get away with giving us a glimpse of some of the upgraded Mac systems (like notebooks) at the September 7 event. Such a move would be similar to how the company previewed the overhauled Mac Pro in the summer of 2013. Apple could then advertise any previewed new Macs with a vague “late 2016” or “early 2017” shipping date and collect pre-orders ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. The refreshed Mac lineup most certainly includes new versions of the all-in-one iMac desktop and the MacBook Pro which should gain latest Intel chips, upgrade graphics, a thinner industrial design akin to the 12-inch MacBook, USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports and that programmable OLED touch strip above the keyboard. Will Apple refresh the MacBook Air notebooks? If so, we only expect modest upgrades to bring the Air’s hardware up to date with features like Intel’s new chips and USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports. A Retina-capable display, an even thinner and lighter appearance and other major hardware undertakings are probably out of the question as most people believe Apple’s been phasing out the Air in favor of the new MacBook for some time now. Credible sources mention the possibility of a standalone monitor with 5K Retina resolution, created in collaboration with LG Electronics. If such product is in the pipeline, I’m wondering if it’ll be branded as a Thunderbolt Display or an LG monitor. The Mac Pro remains the biggest mystery in Apple’s Mac lineup. That machine was awesome back when it launched, but now Apple continues to sell the three-year-old Mac Pro hardware with previous-generation graphics at the same (high) price points, so something’s gotta give here. I want to believe that Apple will continue to cater to creative professionals with powerful Mac desktops like the Mac Pro. And if they’re building a 5K monitor in cooperation with LG, then the Mac Pro’s future is probably assured. Almost forgot: what’s up with the Mac mini? I hope Apple won’t kill of the Mac mini, its most affordable BYODMK (Bring Your Own Display, Mouse and Keyboard) desktop computer because people have been using this unassuming little system to power anything from home offices to media centers to hosting services. Software, Beats & more Apple’s currently tentative release date for iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10 is “fall”, but we’ll be undoubtedly given exact release dates during the iPhone 7 event. Just don’t expect these software updates to drop simultaneously—if past is any indication, iOS 10 will release for public consumption a few days before first iPhone 7 units start shipping to customers. We totally think a selection of new Beats by Dre products will be unveiled on September 7 (thanks, Apple PR!). Who knows—Apple could even rebrand its existing headphone lineup under the Beats moniker (not very likely, but still a tantalizing marketing opportunity). We know this is a stretch—and I’m putting it mildly—but with the next MacBook Pro getting an OLED touch bar who’s to say that Apple’s wireless keyboard won’t be getting the same treatment? On the other hand, if there’s indeed something like an Apple Wireless Keyboard With OLED Touch Bar in the works, Apple could quietly announce it with a press release and a website refresh. One more thing… On top of all of the above, Apple could surprise us with a One More Thing moment that no one saw coming. To be honest with you, we’re not keeping our fingers crossed for any surprise announcements because in this day and age of 24/7 news cycle and Apple’s ever-expanding footprint around the world it’s become nearly impossible for them to prevent leaks. And that, boys and girls, concludes our roundup of everything we expect would get announced on September 7. We want to hear your predictions regarding Apple’s big event.

Apache Project asked to mull it over Software hit by dev drought: Patch it or lose it 2 Sep 2016 at 19:46, Chris Williams The Apache OpenOffice project has limited capacity for sustaining itself in an energetic manner. The retirement of the project is a serious possibility. Those are the words of Dennis Hamilton, the volunteer vice-president of OpenOffice who advises the Apache Software Foundation board. Yesterday, he publicly floated the idea of possibly shutting down the software suite because there just aren't enough developers working on the code, and security bugs aren't being dealt with. In his openoffice-dev mailing list post, Hamilton wrote: I have regularly observed that the Apache OpenOffice project has limited capacity for sustaining the project in an energetic manner. It is also my considered opinion that there is no ready supply of developers who have the capacity, capability, and will to supplement the roughly half-dozen volunteers holding the project together. It doesn't matter what the reasons for that might be. In the case of Apache OpenOffice, needing to disclose security vulnerabilities for which there is no mitigation in an update has become a serious issue ... It is remiss of me not to point out that retirement of the project is a serious possibility. There are those who fear that discussing retirement can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. My concern is that the project could end with a bang or a whimper. My interest is in seeing any retirement happen gracefully. That means we need to consider it as a contingency. For contingency plans, no time is a good time, but earlier is always better than later. On the topic of OpenOffice security bugs, Hamilton shed some light on the handling of CVE-2016-1513, a vulnerability that can be exploited by a malicious presentation document to execute code on a machine when opened. It was reported in October, around the release of OpenOffice 4.1.2. A fix was developed in March although there was no rush to patch the public source code because there was a fear internally that miscreants would spot the commit and realize it was exploitable. Instead, the OpenOffice team held onto the fix to sneak it into an official point release. The person who found and reported the hole grew impatient, and said they would have no choice but to go public to protect users. In July, the OpenOffice team announced there was an exploitable bug, there was no stable patch ready to roll, and the workaround was: use another office suite. The vulnerability will be addressed either in version 4.1.3, a maintenance release, or the 4.2.0 feature release both due later this year. If you can't wait, there's a hotfix to apply manually. Things like this have got Hamilton worried that the open-source suite will crumble rather than gracefully close down. One way out is to put the software into archive mode: no further commits will be accepted, code will remain online for people to fork, and no further releases will be made. This is all at the discussion stage at the moment: the Apache foundation board has not yet taken any decision on the fate of OpenOffice. While OpenOffice suffers from a slow release cycle, has been described as "all but dead" by a Red Hat engineering manager, and has been thoroughly overtaken by the lively LibreOffice fork, programmers working on the code were quick to defend the project from the cyber grim reaper. "Wow, just wow," chimed in source contributor Phillip Rhodes. "I have to say, I think even broaching this topic is a mistake. 'Self-fulfilling prophecy'? Not even that, it'll be a 'third party fulfilling prophecy' as soon as this hits the press. There are a lot of people out there who seem to have it in for Apache OpenOffice and have for a while. "Now you know there will be a headline appearing in the next week, reading 'Apache OpenOffice Mulls Retirement' or 'Apache OpenOffice Begins To Wind Down', etc. Yeah, it's crappy journalism, but it's almost 100 per cent certain to happen. And that's just going to dampen enthusiasm even more. "I wish I could say I had a magic bullet of an answer for how to get things moving again, but I don't. But I don't think opening a discussion about retirement and giving OpenOffice's enemies more ammunition is a strong tactical move." ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 60 Comments More from The Register Google enlists Microsoft VoIP partner to unseat Office 365+Skype RingCentral in the middle 25 Comments Microsoft, Lenovo cross-licensing love-in: Android mobes knocked up with...

Code Thoughts About Think Before You Parallelize A tour of parallel abstractions Aug 30, 2016 In 2005 Intel release the Pentium D, which began the era of multi-core desktop CPUs. Today, even our phones have multiple cores. Making use of all of those cores it not always easy to do, but modern languages and libraries have come a long way to help programmers take advantage. All kinds of utility functions and concurrent abstraction have been developed in an attempt to make using all our cores more accessible and simple. Sometimes these abstractions have a lot of overhead though, and sometimes it doesn’t even make sense to parallelize an operation in the first place. Don’t Parallelize when it is already Parallelized Suppose you are working on a big number crunching function for a high traffic website that is a bit of a performance bottleneck. You get the idea to parallelize it and it tests much faster on your dev machine with 4 cores. You expect great things on the 24 core production server. However once you deploy you find that performance in production is actually slightly worse! What you forgot was that the web server was already parallelizing things at a higher level, using all 24 production cores to handle multiple requests simultaneously. When your paralellized function fires up, all the other cores are busy with other requests. So you take the hit of whatever overhead was required to parallelize the function with no benefit. On the other hand, if your website was say, a low traffic internal website with only a few dozen hits per day, then the plan to parallelize would likely pay off, as there will always be spare cores to crunch the numbers fast. You have to consider the overall CPU utilization of your webserver, and how your parellelized function will interact with the other jobs going on. Will it thrash the L1 cache and slow other things down? Test and measure. Another scenario, say you are working on 3D game, you have some trick physics math where you need to crunch numbers, maybe adding realistic building physics to Minecraft. But separate threads are already handling procedural generation of new chunks, rendering, networking, and player input. If these are keeping most of the system’s cores busy, then parallelizing your physics code isn’t going to help overall. On the other hand if those other threads are not doing a lot of work, cores may indeed be free for you to crunch some physics. So think about the system your code is running in, if things are getting parallelized at a higher level, it may not do any good to do it again at a lower level. Instead, focus on algorithms that run as efficiently as possible on a single core. Consider your target hardware Many developers have very nice machines, probably with a minimum of 8 logical cores these days, possibly more. But consider the entire scope of where your code might run. Will it run on a low cost virtualized web app fabric in the cloud? This may only have 1 or 2 virtual cores for you to work with. Will it run on old desktops or cheap phones, that maybe only have 2 cores? An algorithm that gets sped up on your 8 core system at home may not fair so well on systems with only 2 or 3. Case Study Easy Parallel Loops It is common in a given programming language to have compiler hints or library functions for doing easy parallel loops when it is appropriate. What happens behind the scenes can be very different depending on the abstractions each language or library uses. In some cases a number of threads may be created to operate on chunks of the loop, or ThreadPools may be used to reduce the overhead of creating Threads. It is important to have a rough understanding of how the abstractions available to you work, so you can make educated guesses about when it might be useful to use them, how to tune them, and how to measure them. At minimum you should consider the following issues. If the computational overhead of creating or managing the thread is greater than the benefit you get, you can end up with a slower results than you would doing a single threaded implementation. I will compare some toy workloads with some common parallel loop abstractions in C#, F#, C++ and Java. CSharp     
    public double ImperativeSquareSum()
    {
        var localArray = rawArray;               
        double result = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < localArray.Length; i++)
        {
           result += //Do Work         }
        return result;
    }
         
    public double LinqParallelSquareSum()
    {
        var localArray = rawArray;
        return localArray.AsParallel().Sum(/* Do Work */);
    }
    
    public double ParallelForSquareSum()
    {
        var localArray = rawArray;
        object lockObject = new object();
        double result = 0.0;
        Parallel.For(0, localArray.Length,() => 0.0,
            (i, loopState, partialResult) => { /*Do Work*/ },            
            (localPartialSum) => { lock (lockObject) { result += localPartialSum }});            
        return result;
    }
 1 million doubles - (result += x*x) Method Median Bytes Allocated/Op Imperative 1.1138 ms 29,480.65 LinqParallel 3.3174 ms 117,802.56 ParallelFor 1.9985 ms 59,264.27 The easiest way to parallelize work like this in C# is with PLINQ. Just type your collection name, then .AsParallel() and fire away with Linq queries. Unfortunately in this case it does no good, and neither does the Parallel.For function. The workload of just squaring doubles and adding them up isn’t enough to get a net benefit here. You would need to roll your own function using ThreadPools or perhaps Threads directly to see a speedup. 1 million doubles - (result += Math.sin(x)) Method Median Bytes Allocated/Op Imperative 37.1130 ms 840,522.92 LinqParallel 9.8497 ms 225,694.67 ParallelFor 8.5615 ms 166,386.40 With the bigger workload there is now a large improvement by parallelizing. It takes a CPU about 2 orders of magnitude more cycles to perform a sin operation that it does an add or multiply. Because of this, per-element overhead cost becomes a much smaller percentage of overall runtime, and we get the ~4x speedup we expect from 4 physical cores. It also reduces the relative cost of the simple Linq approach compared to the more complex Parallel.For abstraction. Consider how big the workload is to help decide if the simple Linq approach is worth the cost. FSharp F# has a number of easy to use 3rd party libraries for this purpose. All can be used from C# as well. A quick rundown of them here: 
    (* Nessos Streams ParStream *)
    array
    |> ParStream.ofArray                    
    |> ParStream.fold (fun acc x -> acc + x*x)  (+) (fun () -> 0.0) 

    (* FSharp.Collections.ParallelSeq *)
    array
    |> PSeq.reduce (fun acc x -> acc+x*x)

    (* SIMDArray (uses AVX2 SIMD as well) *)
    array
    |> Array.SIMDParallel.fold (fun acc x -> acc + x*x)
                               (fun acc x -> acc + x*x)  
                               (+) (+) 0.0 

 1 million doubles (result += x*x) Method Time .NET / F# Parallel SIMDArray 0.26ms .NET / F# Nessos Streams 1.05ms .NET / F# ParallelSeq 3.1ms SIMDArray is ‘cheating’ here as it also does SIMD operations, but I include it because I wrote it, so I do what I want. All of these out perform core library functions above. 1 million doubles (result += Math.Sin(x)) Method Time .NET / F# Nessos Streams 6.7ms .NET / F# ParallelSeq 9.9ms The Sin operation can’t be SIMDified here so SIMDArray is out. Nessos streams again proves to be better than the core library functions. C++ Now the same experiment in C++. Most C++ compilers can auto parallelize loops, which you can control via compiler flags or inline hints in your code. For instance with Visual Studio’s C++ compiler you can just put #pragma loop(hint_parallel(8)) on top of a loop, and it will parallelize it if it can. Unfortunately our toy example is (intentionally) a tiny bit too complex for that. Since we are summing up results, this creates a data dependency. Fortunately we can use OpenMP, which is available in Microsoft Visual C++, GCC, Clang, and other popular C++ compilers:     double result = 0;
    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+ : result)     for(int i = 0; i < COUNT; i++) 	
    {
       result += /*Do Work*/;
    }
 This is equivalent to the Parallel.For loop used above in C#, where you identify that you will be aggregating data. This is actually less typing and easier to read too, even if the syntax is odd. How does it perform? 1 million doubles - (result += x*x) No SIMD Method Median ForLoop 1.031 ms ParallelizedForLoop 0.375 ms We can see that OpenMP is managing a more efficient abstraction than .NET for this case, managing almost almost a 3x speedup where .NET was actually a bit slower. Newer OpenMP implementations available on other compiles can also be directed to do SIMD vectorization in the loop for even more speed increase. That does not seem to be available in MS Visual C++, and the usual automatic vectorization seems to not happen within the omp loop. Automatic vectorization can be done on the single thread for loop but it was turned off for these C++ tests. The C++ compilers does do older SSE instructions, as is the case with .NET and Java as well, but they only use a single lane. MSVC++ will use all lanes if you specify /fp:fast but only in the non OMP loop 1 million doubles - (result += sin(x)) No SIMD Method Median ForLoop 10.625 ms ParallelizedForLoop 2.44 ms This time a little more than a 3x speedup, and as you can see the results are overall faster than .NET as well. Java Java’s streams library which performed excellently in a previous blog post can be used here again. You simply have to tell it you want a parallel stream: 
//Regular stream
sum = Arrays.stream(array).reduce(0,(acc,x) -> /*Do Work*/);

//ParallelStream
sum = Arrays.stream(array).parallel().reduce(0,(acc,x) -> /*Do Work*/);

 1 million doubles (result += x*x) Method Median Stream 1.03ms Parallel Stream 0.375ms -> .8ms 1 million doubles (result += Math.sin(x)) Method Median Stream 34.5ms Parallel Stream 7.8ms -> 14ms Java performs right on par with C++ in the first example, but falls behind when using Math.sin(). It appears that this is not due to the parallel streams, but due to Java using a more accurate sin implementation, rather than calling the x86 instruction directly. This difference may not exist on other hardware. I do not like it when a langauge tells me I can’t touch the hardware if I want. A Math.NativeSin() would be nice. The streams library overall though has proven to be excellent, matching C++ in both scalar and parallel varieties. Update! Further experiments with Java using the JMH testing framework have shown the parallel streams to exhibit inconsistent performance. Sometimes executing in ~.375ms indefinitely. Sometimes executing that fast for only a few dozens iterations then suddenly taking ~.8ms indefinitely after that. Reasons unknown, if you are a JVM expert and have ideas, please email me. Javascript pfffftttt (yeah I know about Web Workers) Rust Rust provides no easy loop parallelizing abstractions out of the box, you have to roll your own. OpenMP style features may be in the works for Rust though, and 3rd party libraries are available. So let’s take a look at a nice one called Rayon which adds a “par_iter” providing similar functions as the regular iter, but in parallel. The code remains very simple:     
    // The regular iter
    vector.iter().map(|&x| /* do work */).sum()

    // Parallel iter
    vector.par_iter().map(|&x| /* do work */).sum()

 1 million doubles (result += x*x) Method Median iter 1.05 ms par_iter .375 ms 1 million doubles (result += Math.sin(x)) Method Median iter 9.65 ms par_iter 2.44 ms These are excellent results, tied with C++, and requiring only a single line of code to express. Summary The loop abstractions examined here are just one type of parallel or concurrent programming abstraction available. There is a whole universe out there, Actor Models, Async/Await, Tasks, Thread Pools, and so on. Be sure to understand what you are using, and measure whether it will really be useful, or whether you should focus on fast single threaded algorithms or look for third party tools with better performance.

Microsoft Azure experiences major outage A heavily-tested software update to the Microsoft Azure cloud services resulted in major outages around the world. The irony? The update was designed to improve performance. "During the rollout we discovered an issue that resulted in storage blob front ends going into an infinite loop, which had gone undetected during [testing]," Microsoft's Jason Zander explained. "The net result was an inability for the front ends to take on further traffic, which in turn caused other services built on top to experience issues." According to Microsoft, various Azure services were down for about 11 hours on Wednesday, and though the problem is apparently fixed—i.e. the update was reversed—the Azure Status web site is still reporting some issues. But this outage also impacted Xbox Live on Wednesday. And dammit, Microsoft. That is not OK. "Apple and Google face more encryption criticisms" My criticism: Microsoft can't seem to buy its way into this story. Intel: PC sales will be flat in 2015 And on that note, Intel is getting bullish about the future. The microprocessor giant is predicting growth in calendar year 2015 as the PC market improves and experiences flat year-over-year sales. That wouldn't normally be something to crow about. But after two years of falling sales, the PC market is slowly turning around and leveling off. Yes, we'll take our good news where we can get it. "Google tests subscription service for ad-free web sites" Wait, doesn't Google make all of the ads that I see on web sites? NSA predicts massive cyber-attack in the next decade And now some bad news. Testifying before a House Intelligence Committee hearing this week, NSA director Michael Rogers said that a massive cyber-attack aimed at disabling the electrical grid or other national infrastructure of the United States was a matter of "when" not "if," and that "something dramatic" would happen in the next decade. China, Russia and "one or two others" are already infiltrating the industrial-control systems of the electrical grid, nuclear power plants, air traffic control and subway systems, he said, and leaving behind computer code that could be used to disable them during a future attack. The worst bit? We're completely unprepared to handle such an attack, he said. "Comcast to let customers track and rate technicians with new app" And because they understand their customers, the lowest rating is pre-selected to speed things along. Xiaomi now says it will one day be the biggest smart phone maker in the world And speaking of China, Xiaomi CEO and founder Lei Jun said this week that his company would surpass both Samsung and Apple. "I believe that no one thought the Xiaomi from three years ago, which just made its first phone, would later rank as the third largest player," he said. "Within five or 10 years, we have the opportunity to become the number one smartphone company in the world." Xiaomi is controversial for a number of reasons, and the firm explicitly copies Apple to a degree that would be funny if it weren't so culturally bizarre: Jun even copies Steve Jobs' faux turtleneck/jeans look when he speaks on stage, which is both creepy and silly. But here's the thing: Xiaomi will almost certainly achieve this goal. And Jun's statement was bold enough to illicit a response from Apple, which normally tries to appear to be above the fray. "It is easy to say, it is more difficult to do," Apple legal lead Bruce Sewell said. But I bet this company—which Jun calls "a small miracle"—sees great success when it expands to major new markets like the US. Watch out Apple, the Chinese aren't just going after the electrical grid, they're going after you, too. "Microsoft makes it less attractive for developers to create apps for Windows" See? You didn't think that was possible. Google settles patent suit with Microsoft-backed industry group Google isn't exactly shouting this one to the rooftops, but according to a court filing, the search giant silently and secretly settled a patent infringement lawsuit that was brought down on it by Rockstar, an industry consortium that includes members such as Microsoft, Apple, and Blackberry. The terms of the deal are secret, but since the Rockstar patents are all mobile industry-based, it's fair to suggest that Google has basically started paying for all the intellectual property it stole when it created the Android mobile OS. The only question is how much it paid. "Washington Post's new Kindle Fire app has Jeff Bezos written all over it" Gross. It's official: Android really is the new Windows Security researchers this week have identified a new version of the NotCompatible malware as the culmination of two years of fears: This malware has successfully infected over 50 million mobile devices running Android, they say, and 4 million in the United States alone. It works much like PC malware: The unsuspecting user visits an infected web site and inadvertently downloads the malicious code to their device in what's called a "drive-by." And then the device becomes part of a botnet, or what we used to call a "zombie" when only PCs were susceptible to such attacks, and can be used by hackers to send out spam, bulk-buy tickets from Ticketmaster and other event services, and perform other dastardly schemes. The worst part, of course, is that the device owners are often racking up spurious data charges, too, so it's a win-win. Or something. "What it's like living on a Chromebook, Part 2" A lot like living on food stamps, I'd imagine. GameStop blames delayed game release on terrible quarter Not sure why I find this one so peculiar, but the video game retailer GameStop is blaming its terrible third quarter on the two week delay of a game, "Assassin's Creed: Unity," from October 28 until November 11. Here's the thing. October 28 is three days before the end of the quarter in question, and I find it a bit hard to believe that this one game had that much impact. As it turns out, however, there were other issues: Video game software sales, overall, were down 42 percent year-over-year, and new titles like "Destiny" and "The Evil Within," both launched in October, just aren't doing that well. Maybe "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare" and "Halo: The Master Chief Collection" will pick up the slack this quarter. Or maybe retail video game sales are just a thing from the past. And let's be fair: "Unity" is buggy enough as it is. Imagine how awful it was two weeks earlier. "Will Apple's Next iPhone Capture DSLR Quality with 2 Lenses?"

I have the new app from the cloud, and on my Fire HDX 8.9 (2nd gen); and the "old" washpost app on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (1st gen), and I have to say that the UI for the new app is much more tablet/touch aware. OTOH the new app gives you only a selection of curated articles (I hate curation :grrr) -- the old app gives you pretty much everything albeit with a not great UI. The initial announcement of this implied that fire hdx owners would get the washpost stories for free. As it turns out hdx owners get in for free for 6 months, after that (not mentioned in your referenced article) hdx owners get it for $1/month for an additional 6 months after which it goes to their normal digital pricing (about $50/year -- which is a heck of a lot cheaper than the NYT and WSJ digital editions :grin). I hope at some point this could be free for Prime members (:grin) -- would be a great prime bennie.

Log In or Register to post comments WaltC on Nov 24, 2014 "Cyber attack" can only happen in a very stupid nation where the powers that be are too thick to make sure that all critical infrastructure elements deemed compatible with remote computer control are *physically unplugged* from the public Internet. Hackers cannot hack what is not connected to the network. Such infrastructure should be accessible only through private networks not physically connected to any Internet node. Why this is difficult for the NSA to grasp is beyond me. The solution is as clear as it is obvious. Putting the remote control of nuclear power plants, for instance, "behind firewalls" but leaving it connected to the public Internet is equivalent to tasking the present Congress with the design of the next space shuttle.

ASRock Updates BIOS for Several of Its Motherboards - Download Now The new BIOS releases update Intel ME and Network module Sep 2, 2016 14:39 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Today, ASRock has rolled out several new BIOS packages compatible with some of its motherboards, which update Intel Management Engine (ME) and Network module and also improve the devices’ DRAM compatibility. To be clear about the targeted boards, the producer has provided BIOS 1.40 for its H110M-STX model, version 3.20 for the X99M Extreme4 device, as well as a 3.40 update suitable for X99 WS-E and X99 WS-E/10G motherboards. In addition to that, ASRock has also upgraded the BIOS version for its Fatal1ty X99M Killer, X99E-ITX/ac, and Fatal1ty X99M Killer/3.1 devices, namely the 3.30, 3.60, and 3.80 builds, respectively. However, if you consider a BIOS upgrade, take into account that an installation failure can seriously damage your motherboard; be sure to perform this task under a steady power environment and don’t interrupt in any way. As for the downloadable files, ASRock has available three packages for each board and BIOS version describing different flashing methods: DOS, Instant Flash, and Windows files. To use the DOS archive, simply save and extract it onto a USB stick, connect the drive to your computer, and run the appropriate file from a DOS command screen. Similar steps apply to the Instant Flash file as well, only its content must be executed from BIOS’ flash utility. Last but not least, to flash your BIOS using the Windows-related archive (must extract it as well), close all programs that might interfere with this process, and run the available setup file. That being said, follow the link that best describes your ASRock motherboard from the ones below, take into account all aspects as mentioned earlier, and enjoy your newly improved device.

The Yoga 910 inherits distinctive form-factor from the previous-gen Yoga 900 laptops, makes it slightly thinner and adds a fingerprint reader to the familiar design. The Lenovo Yoga 910 is the direct successor of the Yoga 900 introduced last year, which at present is Lenovo’s top-of-the-range offering in the Yoga lineup. The new Yoga 910 will not only offer higher performance (something that is logical to expect from a PC based on a newer CPU), but also a slightly larger 13.9” IPS display panel with either 4K (3840×2160) or FHD (1920×1080) resolution. Thanks to thinner bezel, the larger screen does not affect dimensions of the convertible, and in fact the new model is even a little smaller and thinner (14.3 mm vs 14.9 mm) than its predecessor. Still, it is noteworthy that the Yoga 910 weighs 1.38 kg (3.04 lbs), which is around 80 grams more than the weight of the Yoga 900. When it comes to battery life the UHD model can offer 10.5 hours on one charge (in line with current models that have 3K displays), whereas the FHD promises to work for up to 15.5 hours (which is a massive improvement over current SKUs).

For wired connectivity, the Yoga 910 has one USB 3.0 Type-C with video out functionality, one USB 2.0 Type-C for charging as well as one USB 3.0 Type-A port with always-on charging capability. When Lenovo’s Yoga 910 laptops hit the market in October, they will be available in Champagne Gold, Platinum Silver and Gunmetal colors. Apparently, Lenovo is dropping its signature Clementine Orange color it uses for consumer notebooks in case of the Yoga 910. As for prices, the new convertibles will start at $1299, which is a $100 increase over current-gen models.

Duterte said he received an intelligence report that “there seems to be new barges coming in and they suspect that’s going to be another construction somewhere.” "What I want to know is, are there any additional construction going on especially in the area of Masinloc?" Duterte said, referring to rich fishing grounds that China has held since 2012. It was the first report of alleged Chinese build-up in the South China Sea since a United Nations-backed tribunal ruled in July that Beijing had no historic rights in the resource-rich waters. The South China Sea, Duterte said, was a “potential flashpoint,” and setting up a “military institution” in the area could disrupt world trade. “I do not intend to raise the issue before the ASEAN. If I do, it will be a convoluted thing,” Duterte said, maintaining that he preferred bilateral talks with China. “I will not because I do not want any clutters there.” Duterte is traveling to Brunei, Laos, and Indonesia starting this weekend for bilateral visits and to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Vientiane. It will be his first foreign trip since assuming office on June 30. Duterte reiterated that any negotiations with China should be based on the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s decision that favored the Philippines. “Whether you like it or not, I proceed, and my predicate for my willingness to talk to you would be the arbitration judgment in our favor,” he said.

The Avalon is still a very extensive work in progress, however the fundamental concept is highly intriguing for anyone interested in PC design – using custom form factor parts and fitting them into a dedicated chassis but still opening up the options for users to customize their build. We were able to grab the hardware and Johnathan Chu, Product Manager for motherboards at ASUS, for a short time to record a video for a quick teardown and analysis. Apologies for the audio, it was an impromptu recording with no equipment apart from a smartphone. Project Avalon Section taken from our Computex 2016 Coverage When you’ve been reviewing and testing motherboards, as well as shouting at certain engineers for absolutely nonsense ideas (or really good ones), there is somewhat a monotony to it all. One generation there’s a new feature from one manufacturer, and the next generation we see it on mostly all the others. Some features are special and aren’t copied, but these require larger amounts of R&D and investment, then require the PR teams to communicate why the new feature is good or not. One interesting conversation I had a couple of years ago was regarding the future of motherboard form factors. It was then as we see now: the full sized ATX, micro-ATX and mini-ITX systems accounted for 99%+ of desktop class PCs. Some large OEMs had their own designs on desktops, Zotac has a number of small mini-PCs for various markets, and servers do all sorts of standard and non-standard sizes, but for the consumer, it is essentially all about those three (and mini-STX is now moving in that space). So a couple of years ago, when the initial talk of Steam machines was coming to play, ASUS asked me what I thought about non-standard motherboard sizes in desktop sized systems. It should be clear to most that the motherboard size issue is a chicken/egg situation. When Intel designs a CPU, there are certain limitations to where everything should go. Or no, I will correct that – there’s a budget limitation to where things can go. For example, memory is often to a certain side of the CPU because that provides the best quality signal for the onboard traces. Technically it can go on a different side (as it does on some designs), but that often requires more motherboard PCB layers to ensure the signal does not degrade or interfere with other signals, and in most cases there is a performance/latency penalty if you have to put it further away. But in order to stay buoyant, a motherboard manufacturer will stick to the appropriate design, because guess what – all the cases use the same standards too. The minute you produce a novel motherboard design, such as a different IO position or a new method for storage, none of the current cases on the market will work with it. So the case manufacturers can’t change because there are no products in a new design, the motherboard manufacturers can’t change because of the lack of cases but also the cost, and Intel keeps it consistent to keep everyone in the chain happy. Hello chicken, meet egg. Hello egg, meet chicken. The only way to do a custom form factor is to build the system completely yourself, which is what Zotac does. Zotac plays mainly in the mini-PC market, and their owner Partner (‘Manufacturer of motherboards, AGP cards and other consumer electronics’ on their Google Search) has long fingers into manufacturing for other big name brands, so integrating the Zotac brand into new designs with custom chassis is easy enough. However ASUS wanted to go bigger and better, and that is how systems like the G20, a full desktop with a custom design, and the GR8, a book-sized Steam machine, came about. But it was clear, ASUS wanted more. Insert Project Avalon. Project Avalon Project Avalon is a custom, high-performance, gaming/VR PC design from ASUS. It is still very early in the design cycle, to the extent that this chassis currently weighs almost 40 lbs, but the concept is there. Inside is a custom designed motherboard that uses various internal connectors to implement various features. The design as it stands is built for Skylake plus a single GPU, and enough space to operate liquid cooling. The Perspex window on the top is so users can see into the design, flashing lights and all. Astute readers will note that the PCB design looks rather odd – there isn’t a PCIe slot here, no power delivery, no rear IO, and what looks like the rear of a 24-pin power connector on the left-hand side. All we needed to do was take the motherboard out: On the top we have a CPU socket, some memory slots, an M.2 slot, and what looks like a number of connectors for daughter boards. If we flip it over: Click the image for the full resolution Here we see more of what we know – power delivery chokes, a chipset, an 8-pin CPU power connector, a PCIe x16 connector and a 24-pin power connector. There are no SATA ports, and nothing on this system looks normal. So, to explain: on the bottom near my finger is a custom connector, akin to a 4x PCIe connector, that breaks out into four SATA ports on a daughter board where are hot swappable on the chassis. The connector supplies both data and power. On the far right is a proprietary ASUS header for the rear IO. At current, ASUS is not finalized on the pin layout and isn’t conforming to any particular standard, but this connector can send chipset PCIe lanes, digital video, and a few other things, over to a daughter board. This means one thing – adjustable rear IO panels! I love this idea. Here are two examples of what ASUS suggests: the top one is a rear IO for workstation users, featuring dual Intel NIC and inside is a RAID capable M.2 slot running at PCIe 3.0 x4. The rear panel is a Home Theater focused design, using a single NIC and a USB 3.1 controller for 10 Gbps use. ASUS also had a VR edition with the specific ports required for the big VR headsets currently in the market. Because the custom connector carries enough PCIe, this opens it up to other custom designs, such as Thunderbolt, 10 Gbit Ethernet, different Ethernet/WiFi, additional storage, or anything that needs PCIe. Also, on the audio side, because this is a separate board, it could also influence audio capabilities and provide cleaner signals for audio processing. Adjustable rear IO is a topic only just being breached, with plenty of possibility. Avalon's design is still very much fluid, with single GPU setups currently being supported: In the video at the top of the page, we were able to get some hands-on time with Jonathan Chu, the product manager of Avalon, and do a quick teardown video after Computex had finished. Apologies for the audio, it was an impromptu recording with no extra equipment apart from a smartphone. At this point the Avalon project is in an early design phase, so ASUS is looking for feedback with what they have so far. I don’t particularly mind if this ends up being an engineering concept design that never goes on sale (I’ve been pushing manufacturers to do more concept designs, similar to vehicle manufacturers at car shows), but the fact that ASUS are prepared to even attempt this is a good thing.   Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 41 Comments View All Comments Exodite - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link Everything comes full circle eventually, with the PC market being stagnant and people not generally upgrading components individually this was inevitable. Is it funny that the first though in my mind were the Amiga 3000/4000 with the modular daughterboards? Reply Mondozai - Monday, September 12, 2016 - link PC market being stagnant? Gaming GPUs are increasing YoY quite a bit. (Overall GPU sales are down from 2011, but that is because a lot of those GPUs were simply entry-level GPUs not used for gaming). Remember, we're talking about ROG here. That is a gaming brand. So gaming sales are what counts. Gaming sales in the PC space are not stagnant, you're talking out of your ass. Reply HOOfan 1 - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link This thing would look right at home in an early 1980s stereo setup Reply fteoath64 - Monday, September 05, 2016 - link Yeah a retro look at this day and age would be very much appropriate since your standard motherboard has been around for decades. The "rear IO" part looks interesting breaking out into SLI for PCIE X16 slots would be needed on the GPU side rather than a daughter-card layout. Reply CaedenV - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link That is cute! One bit of feedback; No home theater person is going consider that home theater backplane. There are 3 options for audio output: Through the video card piggybacking on the HDMI/DP output, via optical, or with old-school analog jacks. I assume that the piggyback option is available, but the lack of optical or surround analog is an instant deal breaker for many. Also, why not make the front drive bay modular like the rear IO area? Again, for a home theater/home server design there would still be lots of call for traditional HDDs, and it looks like you could pretty easily cram 4 HDDs and 2 SSDs up there if you really wanted to. The ability to swap the whole cage out for whatever drive config you need at the moment would be rather useful. Outside of that, it seems like a really great idea! Keep working on it! Reply namechamps - Saturday, September 03, 2016 - link I don't think the lack of optical or analog is a huge issue. Honestly once you have a HDMI capable receiver there is no point to mess with those inferior options. Reply Sushisamurai - Sunday, September 04, 2016 - link I think a lack of optical or analog is a huge deal breaker for any home theater setup - unless you constantly change your receivers to match display technology, your HDMI receivers are going to get outdated quick for HDCP streaming, or you would need enough HDMI ports. My current home theater setup with my projector is direct display connection to the comp, with an optical out to the receiver, as the projector doesn't handle audio out to receiver well - receiver is also out of HDMI ports. Reply Sushisamurai - Sunday, September 04, 2016 - link I understand that current recievers have 6-8 HDMI inputs, but older ones can be populated relatively quickly (3 to 5): 1. Blu-ray 2. Chromecast/AppleTV 3. Xbox 4. PS3/4 5. Computer I assume most home setups have this configuration. Reply drgigolo - Monday, September 05, 2016 - link I think you are very wrong in this. I haven't heard of anybody who doesn't use HDMI directly. If you run out of HDMI ports on your receiver, you can always hook it up directly to the TV and then use optical from the TV to the receiver. Analog from your computer to your hifi sucks most of the time. A lot of interference and cables that cause problems. It's best to get the digital to analog conversion as far away from the computer as possible in my experience. Reply vacavalier - Saturday, September 24, 2016 - link Not true... Using a SB ZxR PCI-e sound card w/Analog Monster cables from my PC direct to my Onkyo TX-NR809 and running the sound through two Klipsch RB-81 II's (bi-wired w/12 ga.wire) and a Klipsch 12RW-D and the sound and imaging (both iTunes and gaming) is simply incredible.... No sound effects are applied through or by the AVR and this setup simply destroys any plug-n-play speaker setups, regardless of price-point, name-brand, features, etc. on the market today. Once funds allow, the Onkyo will either be: upgraded to a higher quality integrated amp, power & pre-amp duo or add an analog/tube power amp to it. I know sound quality is subjective to the listener but honestly, I tried this same setup using the onboard Realtek sound "chip" (because that is what it is) and the sound "sucked" as you stated. A higher quality soundcard must be employed to achieve the desired effect and on that note, one where the op-amps can be swapped to further upgrade/sweeten the sound. Just my opinion here concerning what hardware is involved, concerning analog sound.

SCOUT Sooner Intel: Calm before storm Bob Przybylo 09/02/2016 Intel returns with an update on OU's major visiting weekend coming up in two weeks. Oklahoma looks like it’s going to be throwing everything and the kitchen sink into Ohio State weekend. Both on the field and on the recruiting trail. Where in the past the Sooners have sort of staggered official visits, the mentality this time around seems to be to converge in Norman when the Buckeyes come to town. We’re still two weeks away from the game itself, but here are confirmed official visitors when you know full well plenty of more are coming and a crazy amount of 2018 unofficial visitors will be making their way to OU that evening as well.

I’m gonna leave a link to this, as well as everything in the bag, in the description below, but if you’re wanting to look this up on your own, it’s spelled N-R-G. Here’s what’s special about it. This is a bag built for gadgets. It’s ridiculously spacious, water resistant, and can charge  your gadgets when you’re on the go. More on that in a bit. You might be wondering why I called this the What’s in my Bag: Overkill edition, and you’re about to find out. As most of you know, I work from home, and creating tech content like this video is what I do for a living. What that means is, when I am on the go, it’s because I am leaving town - and that means I need everything necessary to keep the content flowing for you guys. Let’s start in the front pocket. Oh, and remember how I said this bag can charge up your gadgets? There’s a 7000mAh removable battery built in to this bag. It can be removed to be charged, or you can just open up the power port on the side of the bag and plug the AC adapter into there. The battery powers the USB port on the side of the backpack, which can charge up any smartphone or tablet. Even cooler, on the inside you’ll find built-in Lightning, microUSB, and Apple 30-pin charging cables, all of which are directly connected to the power in the bag as well. So, you are covered regardless of the device you have on you, and that’s pretty cool. MACBOOK Of course, when I’m on the go, I need my mobile workstation, and in this instance, that’s the 2016 MacBook. I’ve got the Rose Gold model with the upgraded 1.3GHz Intel Core M7 processor and 512GB of storage. I’ll be bringing you my review of Apple’s latest MacBook soon, but in my early tests it beats last years model easily. IPAD PRO In addition to the MacBook, I also keep a 12.9-inch LTE iPad Pro in my bag as well. Sometimes I just wanna use iOS apps to connect to my TiVo to watch shows, or stream Netflix, Hulu, or just play a game. Of course I’ve got the smart keyboard connected in case I also wanna get some work done... But yes, sometimes I don’t need the larger form factor, and therefore I ALSO have the 9.7-inch LTE iPad Pro with me as well. The larger model pretty much needs to be on a table or desk to be useable, and this smaller version is fine in the hands, and has that fresh True Tone display as well, which is great for reading. KINDLE OASIS That said, if I really wanna get some reading done without distractions or the temptation of other apps, I also have a Kindle e-reader in my bag at all times. RIght now, it’s the brand new Kindle Oasis, which Amazon just released last week. I’m a fan of this because it includes a leather charging cover, and a fully charged Kindle Oasis and Oasis case provides a ridiculous multi-month battery life. APPLE PENCIL Since I’ve got two iPad Pro units in my bag, it only makes sense that I’d also bring along the accessories that make the iPad Pro an iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is definitely part of that equation, coming in handy when I’m making those sick YouTube thumbnails on the go. PowerAdd Slim2 CHARGER This small charger by PowerAdd sports 5000mAh of power, enough to recharge a current smartphone almost twice, and it’s not too big to fit into a pocket if you need to charge up while using your device. It’s also not too expensive at all at just $10. ANKER CHARGER But when I need more power, or to charge more than one device, this Anker charger is my go to. It’s sleek and slim, looks great, has 3 USB ports, a built-in flashlight, and has an incredible 20100mAh battery on the inside. You can even use this to charge the MacBook over USB-C. NINTENDO 3DS I’ve got the New Nintendo 3DS to take care of boredom on flights, as well as to give me an opportunity to get some gaming in since I’m so busy as home making videos nonstop. Specifically, this is the limited edition Legend of Zelda Majora’s Mask console. CABLES Of course, I need to have every cable that I may possibly need, because, you never know, right? Ethernet, Lightning, microUSB, mini USB, USB-C, etc. I’ve also got some USB-C dongles for the MacBook, in case I need to plug in a standard USB device or HDMI cable. IPHONE SE - VRS Design Case In the back pocket found on the rear of the NRG bag, I usually store a couple of extra smartphones. I’m usually reviewing and testing multiple models, and this is a great place to keep them protected. Here I have the iPhone SE, although you probably wouldn’t know it due to the unique case. This is actually another case from VRS Design, which can also hold some card or cash. Just like the LG G5, VRS design makes some sweet cases for iPhones as well. I’ll have more on these iPhone SE cases in a future video, so look out for that one. LG G5 - VRS Design Case Here I’ve got the LG G5, the latest flagship from LG. I keep that on me  in order to compare smartphones when I am doing reviews on the go. If you’re thinking about picking up the LG G5, I’ll leave a link to my full review video for you to check out. Oh, and to keep it protected, I’ve got it in a case from VRS Design. This one is called the High Pro Shield, and it’s two pieces - one soft piece that protects the phone from shock, and a hard bumper that goes around it. I’ve been trying out a bunch of different cases from VRS Design lately, and I’m a big fan of both the look and the quality of their designs. In fact, I’ll show you another one a little later on. If you need a case for your LG G5, VRS Design cases start at about $11. HTC 10 This is the HTC 10, and if you’ve been following my channel, you know that I picked my review unit up from the launch party that took place in New York City a couple of weeks ago. I’m just about done with my full review of the HTC 10, and while you wait for that, feel free to check out my coverage from the launch party, as well as my picks for the top 5 features on this device. NECTAR GLASSES: Dank Depending on where I’m going, sunglasses could be a necessity. I like to keep a pair of stylish but inexpensive shades with me at all times, just in case. I keep my more expensive sunglasses in my car, so when I’m on the go, I’m all about Nectar Sunglasses. Here you see the Dank edition Sunnies, which cost just $30. Moment Case and Lenses Moment Lenses and the accompanying Moment Case are invaluable tools for getting fantastic photos and videos using my iPhone 6S Plus (which isn’t in my bag because it’s home is my back pocket.) You insert the iPhone into the Moment Case, which is communicates with over Bluetooth, and provides a nice camera grip and shutter button. I have three lenses, all of which are premium glass. One is a wide angle, one is telephoto, and the last is a macro. Earin headphones I’m testing these Earin headphones. They are completely wireless Bluetooth earbuds. No wire to plug into your device, and no wire connected the two ear pieces. They’re decent so far, but audio drop outs on one ear or the other can get annoying. Still, many think wireless earbuds are the future, so I’m keeping my eye on this space. LSTN Wembley bamboo earbuds These LSTN Wembley earbuds are some of the best in-ears I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, which is why I’m not totally sold on the idea of completely wireless buds just yet. I’m usually more a fan of over-ear headphones, but I agreed to try out the LSTN buds and was immediately blown away by how great they sound - and the bamboo wood construction is beautiful. They’re noise-isolating and electro-acoustically tuned to produce high-end sounds quality at any volume, and the real wood housing provides a rich, full sound. Even better, your purchase helps support LSTN and Starkey Hearing Foundation’s mission to help restore hearing worldwide. Belkin SurgePlus USB Swivel Charger The Belkin SurgePlus has been a lifesaver, and it has had a spot in my travel bag for about 8 years. It plugs into a standard outlet, and provides you with three surge-protected AC outlets, as well as two USB charging ports. WHen you’re in a hotel room and outlets are scarce, the SurgePlus quickly becomes your best friend. Mophie Juice Pack When I’m on the go and don’t need to carry my bag with me, I look to the Mophie Juice Pack to keep my iPhone 6S running all day. It does double as a protective case, but that’s not why I use it - I just wanna be able to go from morning til late at night when I’m at these influencer events, and the Juice Pack means I don’t need to find an outlet. Audeze EL-8 Titanium This might be my favorite thing in my bag - the Audeze EL-8 headphones. World’s First Headphones With Fully Integrated Apple Lightning Cable. The EL-8 Titanium headphones come with an exclusive lightning cable that streams a complete 24-bit digital signal through a high quality DSP and DAC to offer better sound quality. The built in microphone can be used for phone calls and is SIRI compatible. An accompanying Audeze app can be used to apply EQ and sound presets. For non- Apple device compatibility, the headphones also include a standard analog cable.

 Tesla's grow-at-all-costs strategy could backfire Travis Hoium, The Motley Fool Sep. 2, 2016, 9:16 PM 2,255 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo Silicon Valley is the home of some of the biggest tech companies in the world and the area's engineers and investors have used some fairly similar strategies to dominate their respective industries. If you look at the largest Silicon Valley success stories they serve what may be considered to be a two-sided market with a high probability of network effects that keep competitors at bay. As a result, the businesses require rapid growth in order to capture market share, and once you get that market share the profits start pouring in. Apple, Google, Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Intel, and Oracle are just a few of the tech companies that have exploited the near monopoly power a two-sided market can provide to build massive businesses. This is the context under which Elon Musk got his start in business and are some of the dynamics that made Paypal such a success. Now, with its Gigafactory 1, Model 3 production plans, and solar investments, it looks like Tesla Motors is treating energy a lot like Silicon Valley neighbors with a "grow at all cost" mentality. But are cars, energy storage, and solar panels at all similar to building a software company in Silicon Valley? The power of two-sided markets Before we dive too far into Tesla's strategy, I think it's important to look at how two-sided markets and the network effect have been used in Silicon Valley. In a two-sided market, a company is bringing some value to one group of people (usually consumers) and another value to another separate group of people (usually suppliers), creating value for both. Having more customers brings more suppliers, which makes the market more attractive to customers, which brings more suppliers, and so on. That's the network effect. Once both groups of people start using the company's services it's often very difficult to leave, which is why companies with a dominant market share can become so valuable. Apple's iPhone is a great example of this dynamic at work. As people bought iPhones it created a large market for developers to build apps and sell them to customers. More apps made iPhones more attractive than competing products and led to more iPhone sales. Eventually, millions of customers and developers were locked in. Today, even if Blackberry introduced a phone that was better than the iPhone it wouldn't have the developer infrastructure or the user base to be an attractive platform, making it very difficult for either consumers or developers to leave iPhone for Blackberry. Musk's first major success, Paypal, used the same concept. Once consumers had Paypal accounts it made it attractive for both other consumers to get Paypal and for businesses to accept Paypal in their own payment systems. And growth in users led to growth in businesses using Paypal, leading to a virtuous cycle. Every company I mentioned above serves a two-sided market in one way or another, benefiting from the network affect the market can provide. A key to the success of each of them was rapid growth to take a vast majority of their potential market before competitors could catch up, and once they dominate the market they're the de facto standard. It's why Uber fights Lyft so intensely and why Amazon is willing to lose money just to take share against online retail rivals. They all want to be the standard in the market. The question is: Does this typical Silicon Valley playbook work for Tesla Motors? How Tesla Motors is starting to look like Silicon Valley neighbors The way that Musk has been building out Tesla Motors' capabilities as well as its partnerships is a lot like a tech company in a two-sided market. He's trying to grow Tesla Motors and SolarCity as quickly as possible, taking as much market share as possible. The more capabilities he can offer to customers the more they'll buy. An electric vehicle turns into a solar-power system, which may eventually turn into a Powerwall or even a solar roof. From the supplier side, Musk has tried to standardize his own products. In EVs, he opened up all of Tesla Motors' patents, not out of the goodness of his heart, but because he wanted competitors to start using Tesla's proprietary charging plug design. If he could get others to use Tesla technology it could start controlling the charging network. He's dismissed the hydrogen technology Toyota and Honda are working on as "incredibly dumb." If electricity is the standard, Tesla Motors will be a big winner. In solar, SolarCity bought ZepSolar just as it was becoming the standard racking design for the industry. And it tried to take so much market share that competitors were effectively squeezed out of the market out of a lack of scale. Energy storage may be where the real vision of a network effect is being built. If Tesla Motors acquires SolarCity and energy storage becomes a standard offering with solar and EVs, utilities will become the partner on the other side of the market from consumers. Musk would control when energy storage systems are charged and discharged, which would make Tesla a key partner to utilities along with being a supplier of batteries to the utility itself. Utilities may not be willing partners with Tesla, but they would be forced to be partners if the company has enough batteries and EVs in the market. Where the network effect falls apart for Tesla Motors The idea of Tesla Motors being at the center of a two-sided market may look good on paper, but in practice it won't work anything like a typical tech company. I don't think customers are more likely to buy a solar-power system from Tesla just because they bought an EV from them and energy storage won't be a guaranteed add-on. The goal of standardizing EV or solar designs has failed because no major automaker is using Tesla plugs and solar components are easy to swap out. Competing technology like hydrogen will also compete on its own and may be in adjacent markets, not the EVs or battery energy storage Musk is building today. Trucks are already being developed with hydrogen/electric powertrains and competitors are launching hydrogen cars. Most importantly, energy is a highly regulated market, unlike computer operating systems, ride sharing networks, or social media. For Tesla to compete in solar and energy storage it will have to compete on a level playing field with other companies in the same business. Scale could help, but there will be no locking out competitors because regulators will demand transparent bidding on services. And that could derail how Musk is looking at being a central player in the tie between consumers and suppliers in the energy market. Tesla's products may not have a Silicon Valley advantage At the end of the day, Tesla Motors' products will likely have to stand on their own against the competition, without a the competitive advantages two-sided markets have brought to much of Silicon Valley. That'll make competition a lot more fierce and could make it harder to make a profit as a result. That's something to keep in mind when investors are cheering Tesla Motors' grow at all costs strategy. Read the original article on The Motley Fool. Copyright 2016. Follow The Motley Fool on Twitter.

But it seems that a much colder island far to the north might also wish to be called New Ireland – the island formerly known as Great Britain. In the wake of the European commission’s ruling that Ireland must reclaim €13bn plus interest in taxes from Apple, there is a good deal of excitement at the prospect of a post-Brexit Britain replacing its smaller neighbour in the affections of tax-shy global corporations. As the Daily Telegraph put it in an editorial: “If Ireland and the EU do not want a huge, wealth-creating firm doing business in their territory, Apple will be very welcome in the UK.” Welcome, that is, to use the UK as it has previously used Ireland – as a compliant state that will look the other way while vast profits pass through, untaxed. It is, on the surface, an appealing prospect. You only have to walk around Dublin or Cork to see that Ireland’s tax regime has been a honeypot for all the hottest digital corporations – not just the long-established ones like Apple, Microsoft and Intel but the entire new wave of internet behemoths: Google, Facebook, Twitter and so on. And the same is broadly true in other areas such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Little Ireland has a stock of US direct investment much larger than France and Germany combined. Ireland is the number one location worldwide for investment by US chemical and pharmaceutical companies and number two for IT companies. And no one thinks those corporations are attracted by the scenery. For the more excitable elements among the Brexiters, the EU’s ruling on Apple’s tax bill thus opens up a delirious prospect. The Brussels bureaucrats are moving against Ireland’s vigorously pro-business taxation policies, but Britain, when it throws off the shackles of the EU, will be free to swoop in and grab the golden eggs from the Irish nest. Apple and Pfizer, Facebook and Google, driven by EU persecution from the emerald isle, will seek asylum in the New Ireland next door, where the writ of the Eurocrats does not run and the government knows how to treat a corporation with the respect it deserves. Could there be any more dramatic illustration of both the evils of the EU and the thrilling possibilities of Brexit? There are, however, two small questions about this strategy. Is it possible? And is it desirable? The answers might perhaps curb the enthusiasm of the true believers. There is, for a start, the small matter of whether, even after the EU tax ruling, Apple wants to leave Ireland for the UK or anywhere else. The answer could hardly be clearer – it doesn’t. In an interview with Ireland’s national broadcaster RTE, chief executive Tim Cook was full of indignation at the very idea that Apple might have benefited from illegal state aid in the form of a sweetheart tax deal. “When you are accused of doing something that’s so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, that’s how we feel,” he said. He made clear that Apple will appeal against the €13bn ruling and that it expected the Irish government to do the same. Those listening out for signs of a dismay that might be exploited by post-Brexit Britain will have been encouraged – up to a point. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty And the point at which the encouragement stopped was when Cook discussed Apple’s intentions. What will Apple do in benighted EU-ridden Ireland? Keep investing. He reaffirmed without qualification that Apple was going ahead with a major expansion of its campus in Cork: “We’re very committed to Ireland, have been for 37 years. We have a long-term romance together.” So why on earth would Apple remain in Ireland instead of taking refuge in the brave new post-Brexit world of low-tax Britain? Partly because tax, even for greedy corporations, isn’t everything. And partly because Apple is smart enough to know that the kind of outrageous dodge that resulted in a tax rate in 2014 for its Irish-based subsidiary of 0.005% is not sustainable – in Ireland, Britain or any other democratic society. Though market fundamentalists find it hard to believe, even global corporations need social relationships. Will they exploit every possible loophole to maximise their profits? Yes – ruthlessly and without conscience. But is the ability to dodge tax the sole criterion they apply to their decisions to invest? No. As Cook acknowledged: “We went into Ireland in 1980. We didn’t go there to seek advantages on taxes – we had only 60 employees and very little revenue.” This reassurance explains why public and political opinion in Ireland has been more ambivalent about the Apple ruling than the establishment consensus would suggest. The big right-of-centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have backed Apple to the hilt and tried to rally the public by warning that accepting the unpaid taxes would drive multinational investors away. But most people seem to understand that it’s not so simple. The choice between colluding in morally obnoxious tax avoidance on the one hand and facing economic chaos on the other does not ring true. The Brexiters’ fantasy of stealing Ireland’s corporate investors relies on a deeply patronising attitude to Ireland. Underlying it is the notion that no foreign company would possibly invest in Ireland for any other reason than its lax attitude to taxation. But there are a lot of other reasons – a highly skilled and productive workforce, cultural vitality, political stability and (oddly enough) membership of the European Union with full access to the world’s biggest single market. The obsession of giant corporations with avoiding tax does not blind them to their need for the social, political and cultural resources on which they draw. This is not just a matter of theory. A crucial point easily lost in the noise of the EU’s Apple ruling is that the regime under which it could avoid so much tax has already changed. The notorious “double Irish” strategy used by Apple and other corporations to make themselves stateless for taxation purposes is being dismantled. Market fundamentalists would tell us that corporations will respond to this tightening of the tax regime by fleeing Ireland. Actually, they’ve responded by paying more tax: Ireland took in €6.9bn in corporation tax last year compared with €4.6bn in 2014 when the abolition of the “double Irish” was announced. And why was the Irish corporate tax regime made tougher? Not because of the EU but because of an organisation the Brexiters seem not to have heard of: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is the OECD, not the EU, that has driven attempts to clean up the worst excesses of corporate tax avoidance. (One way of seeing the severity of the Apple ruling is as an attempt by the EU to regain the initiative on an issue of such global consequence.) The UK is a member of the OECD and has signed up to these anti-tax avoidance strategies. Unless Britain wants to go completely rogue and leave the OECD as well as the EU, the fantasy of luring companies such as Apple with the virtual impunity from taxation they used to enjoy in Ireland could not be fulfilled. So much for the possibility of becoming the New Ireland – what about the desirability? Would it be good for Britain if it were to try to emulate Ireland’s strategy of relying on foreign investment and attracting it by becoming, in effect, a tax haven for the largest corporations? The key point about Ireland’s Faustian pact with global corporations is that it was a strategy of desperation. The country sold its soul in the 1960s because it had a stagnant agricultural economy. Indigenous industrial development was slow and weak, Ireland was an economic vassal of the UK and mass emigration was bleeding the country dry. Giving global corporations massive tax breaks wasn’t an ideological principle – it was a last resort when pretty much everything else had failed. This matters in the British context because it explains why very low corporation taxes could operate in Ireland without creating social conflict. The corporate devil gave the Irish Faust a pretty good price for his soul: a way of moving from backwardness to modernity. But Britain has a radically different economic, social and political history. Transplanting a policy that worked for very specific reasons in Ireland into post-Brexit Britain would show scant regard for the nature of either country. Ireland has had to live with the consequences of its particular choice. One of them is what US economist Paul Krugman recently called “leprechaun economics”. Krugman coined the phrase in response to the news that the Irish economy grew by an incredible 26.3% in 2015. Literally incredible – the figures are massively inflated by the fiscal juggling of the giant corporations. Irish GDP is meaningless. There is a vast gulf between the real economy and the kind of hyped-up faux-economy you get when you turn your state into a conduit for torrents of funny money. And that hype is not harmless – the Celtic Tiger bubble was one of its more catastrophic products. It is not accidental that Ireland has the most unequal distribution of market income (before tax and welfare) in the developed world. In effect, there are two Irish economies: the foreign corporate economy that is highly skilled, ultra-globalised and very favourably treated by the state; and a weaker indigenous economy that exists in its shadow. One of the consequences of this extreme inequality of market income is that the state has to do an enormous amount of heavy lifting through the income tax and welfare systems to keep these divisions in check. This activist state is hardly what the British right expects it will get if it follows the Irish model.

Apple has had operations in Ireland for 37 years. Photograph: Irish Examiner And here, surely, is the fatal contradiction in the notion of a post-Brexit Britain that will combine huge tax benefits for the corporate few with Theresa May’s promise of social justice for the many. The more honest voices urging Britain to replace Ireland as the new best buddy of the global corporations recognise that radical cuts to corporate taxes would have to be matched by drastic reductions in personal taxes because otherwise rage at grossly unequal treatment would destabilise society and politics.Hence the final paradox: giving the corporations what they want on tax means not giving them what they need in every other respect. The general low tax regime in this brave new Britain would be delightful for the likes of Apple – except when they want a terrific educational system to produce their smart workforce, a national health service to keep them healthy, a decline in social inequality to keep the political environment stable and lots of public investment in world-class infrastructure. And for those things they need big government funded by high taxes – on somebody else. It is pure delusion to think that the smartest corporations will be drawn to a Britain not only outside the single European market but no longer raising enough tax to invest in its society, services and infrastructure. Ireland is discovering that the game of beggar-my-neighbour tax policies is pretty much up. Inside or outside the EU, Britain will have to join Ireland and the rest of Europe in telling the corporations that, if they want to operate in civilised societies, they have to help pay for them. Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times FIAT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: AFP/Getty Images In 2015 the European commission ruled that the Italian carmaker’s financing company had paid taxes on profits that had been underestimated. The commission found that Fiat Finance and Trade, which is based in Luxembourg and provides financial services, such as intra-group loans, to other Fiat group car companies, engaged in “many different transactions with Fiat group companies in Europe”. Its investigation showed that a tax ruling by the Luxembourg authorities gave a selective advantage to Fiat Finance and Trade, which had allowed it to reduce its tax burden by between €20m and €30m since 2012. Fiat insisted its dealings merely amounted to a clarification of pricing rules and did not constitute state aid, but it was ordered to repay £25.5m. MCDONALD’S Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: AFP/Getty Images In May, the French headquarters of the global fast-food chain was raided by tax officials who seized financial documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The company’s finances have been in the spotlight since last year, following claims that it struck a deal with the Luxembourg authorities to significantly reduce its tax bill on European sales. Following the raid, a spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “From 2010 to 2014, the McDonald’s companies paid more than €2bn just in corporate taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate of almost 27%.” AMAZON Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Reuters In 2013 it was revealed the online giant had paid only £10m in UK corporation tax, despite sales in Britain reaching £4.3bn. The commission is scrutinising Amazon’s 2003 tax deal with Luxembourg: Brussels believes it may have allowed Amazon’s European headquarters to lock in a preferentially low tax rate. However, Amazon says it does not receive preferential treatment from Luxembourg. It also insists that it is not based in the duchy – where it has more than 1,000 employees – primarily for tax reasons. STARBUCKS Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images The US coffee chain has said that it has not made a profit in the UK over 15 years despite cumulative sales of £2bn. Up to 2012, it had paid corporation tax of only £8.6m. In 2015, the commission ruled Starbucks had to repay £22.8m of what were described as “illegal” tax breaks. An investigation by the commission showed that a tax ruling issued by the Dutch authorities in 2008 gave a selective advantage to Starbucks Manufacturing in the Netherlands – the company’s European coffee roasting operation – which enabled it to reduce its tax burden. BELGIUM-LINKED MULTINATIONALS In January, the commission concluded that selective tax advantages granted by Belgium under its “excess profit” tax scheme were illegal. The scheme was found to have benefited at least 35 multinationals, which were ordered to return unpaid taxes – estimated to be worth around €700m – to Belgium. Among those required to comply with the order were brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, German chemicals giant BASF, and BP.

New IOWait Boosting Patches For Intel P-State, Schedutil Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 3 September 2016 at 03:16 PM EDT. 2 Comments Linux power management and ACPI maintainer Rafael Wysocki has published a set of new "iowait boost" patches for P-State and Schedutil that he's looking to see benchmarked by interested parties. If you didn't read the article about the IOWait Boost patches from a few weeks ago, see P-State Algorithm Change, Schedutil IOWait Boosting. With the four patches published on Friday, there is iowait boost support for the Intel P-State scaling driver and CPUFreq's Schedutil governor. The four patches can be found on the kernel mailing list. I'll try to find the time this weekend to patch a test kernel and see how these patches are doing and if they affect the performance for any of our workloads of interest. The algorithm change for P-State should be particularly interesting. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

CES kicks off the year in January, Mobile World Congress sets the pace for spring, Computex sets the agenda in the summer, and IFA has become the big show to watch each Labor Day weekend. And this year it’s bigger than ever. To cover IFA 2016, Digital Trends sent its biggest crew to date. Nine of our best editors, video producers, and writers have been scouring the show floor in Berlin this week to bring you the latest major tech from companies like Samsung, Lenovo, Huawei, LG, Sharp, Philips, ZTE, and many more. We’ve seen it all and had a blast writing, tweeting, and covering the show live on Facebook for you all. It took us a few days, and some intense deliberation, but we’ve put our heads together and finally picked our favorites from the show. Without further ado, here’s our Top Tech picks of IFA 2016 in each major tech category. Best of Show: Lenovo Yoga Book For years, we’ve seen sci-fi movies, designers, and futurists dream of a device with a massive touch surface that doubles as a keyboard. Now it’s reality. The Yoga Book is that device. Actually, it’s more. The touch surface is not only a keyboard but also, well, a touch surface, usable with finger and stylus. That makes it easy to jot down notes, something that’s now possible without touching the display itself – though, you can still do that, too. You might expect such forward-thinking tech to cost a fortune. It doesn’t. The Yoga Book with Android is $500, and with Windows 10, it’s $550. It’s even light, thin, well built, and features a beautiful 1,920 x 1,200 pixel display. It’s not just a solid 2-in-1. It’s a visionary concept that hints at how smartphones, tablets, and notebooks could coverage. – Matt Smith Audio: Audeze iSine 10 Audeze is on a roll right now. So far, every Planar Magnetic headphone has been a hit with reviewers and headphone lovers alike. That trend will likely continue with the new iSine 10 announced at IFA 2016, the first single-driver planar magnetic in-ear headphones ever made. We had a chance to give the iSine 10 a listen on the show floor, and although their open-backed design let a lot of the surrounding noise through we could very clearly hear how wonderful they sounded. Bass is immense and deep, the mid range is lush and transparent, and treble is crystal clear with not so much as a hint of harshness. Top to bottom, the iSine 10 are a luscious sounding headphone. Toss in the conventional 3.5 mm headphone cable and Apple Lightning cable with built-in DAC and amplifier, along with the price tag of $400, and you have an easy winner for our audio category. – Caleb Denison Computing: Lenovo Yoga 910 The Lenovo Yoga 910 isn’t an innovative notebook. Lenovo came up with the Yoga concept about four years ago, and even the watchband hinge has been around for years. Yet the 910 is a strong contender, and noteworthy 2-in-1, because it brings many innovations together in one, complete package. It has everything, including: 7th-generation Intel Core processor, thin-bezel display, 4K resolution, PCI Express solid state drive, and USB-Type C. All of that’s wrapped into a system that’s less than 15 millimeters thick, and available for $1,300. It’s a powerhouse, yet it’s also a system you can take anywhere. And that makes it a winner. – Matt Smith Cool Tech: Yuneec Breeze There were a lot of drones at IFA this year, but even among a sea of incredible UAVs, Yuneec’s Breeze drone stood out. Why? Well for starters, it’s the first 4K camera drone from a major manufacturer that you can get your hands on for under 500 bucks. But that’s not the only reason we picked it. This little whippersnapper also boasts a range of automated flight modes (follow me, orbit, selfie, and more) that are normally only available in much more expensive hardware. Basically, it’s a highly capable camera drone designed for casual pilots instead of hobbyists. It gives average Joes an easy way to snag eye-popping aerial video, and for a reasonable price, too. – Drew Prindle Cool Tech: Botscan Botspot’s giant 3D scanner, the Botscan, is absolutely ridiculous. The company claims that it’s one of the most advanced 3D scanners in the world — and after stepping inside it and seeing what it can do, we definitely believe them. Botscan is essentially a cylindrical room with walls made of light and a series of high-resolution DSLR cameras. With this setup, and a technique called photogrammetry, Botscan can capture insanely detailed scans of practically anything — people, products, or even cars. These scans can then be used for 3D modeling, developing prosthetics, virtual shopping, or even architecture. – Drew Prindle Home: LG InstaView Signature Fridge It was pretty cool when LG let you knock on a fridge’s opaque surface to turn it transparent, letting you scout for snacks without letting a ton of air inside the appliance. But soon, there will be a third face to the InstaView Signature fridge: Windows 10. Late next year, LG will roll out a smart version, and essentially the entire right top door will be a computer. Stream Pandora, tag food with expiration dates, and leave notes from your family, or just leave it on the opaque setting to give the illusion that this is any old refrigerator. LG plans to open the platform to developers, so hopefully by the time the fridge is available, it will have even more tricks hidden behind its black surface. – Jenny McGrath Home: Netatmo Smart Valve Sure, smart thermostats are neat, but apartment dwellers often can’t make use of them — especially if their heat comes out of radiators. Netatmo debuted its Smart Valve at IFA, and a lot of renters might see the value in it (as in, it should save them some bucks on their heating bill). It replaces your standard radiator knob with an attractive piece of hardware that works in concert with the Netatmo thermostat. But even if you don’t have access to your building’s thermostat, the valve will still work with your phone via a bridge. Best of all? It’s pretty easy to install and uninstall, so you can take it with you when you move. – Jenny McGrath Latin Innovation: Solidmation Solidmation is an Argentinean company that locally designs, develops, and produces IoT solutions for the home automation industry. And the company is at IFA to introduce a new portfolio of connected-home devices focused on comfort and energy saving. The platform lets you control almost any electrical appliance at home with a smartphone app. To use it, you need only a Wi-Fi connection and a Solidmation device connected to the appliance (your current light bulb, a curtain, the air conditioner or thermostat, a coffeemaker, etc.). By adding Solidmation devices, you add intelligence to your current appliances. The company just introduced its Wi-Fi solutions to the Argentinean retail market and looks forward to finding suitable partners to enter other markets. This is clearly a company to watch. – Juan Garcia Mobile: ZTE Axon 7 Mini When ZTE released the Axon 7 earlier this year, it impressed us with a svelte, curved, metal body and a very reasonable price. The Axon 7 Mini boasts the same sexy design and snappy performance, but every element has been scaled down, including the price. The 5.2-inch, 1080p screen looks crisp and vivid, and the octa-core Snapdragon is backed by 3GB of RAM offering plenty of power, but the real star of the show is the Axon’s audio quality. The dual front-facing speakers are impressively loud, and through headphones the sound really sings, with punchy bass that never gets boomy, and clean, crisp highs. – Malarie Gokey Video: Philips 901F 4K UHD OLED TV At IFA 2015, Panasonic emerged as the first tier-one TV maker to take on LG with an OLED TV — and this year Dutch electronics outfit Philips joined the party. The 55-inch 901F offers 4K Ultra HD resolution, high dynamic range (HDR), a 6.1-speaker system developed with Dolby, and the Android TV platform powered by a quad-core processor. The 901F’s black levels are exactly what you’d expect from an OLED TV, and its colors looked vibrant and well-saturated in the short demo reel Philips had running. What really makes this OLED TV stand out, however, doesn’t have anything to do with its picture quality: the Philips Ambilight system. The 901F is also priced pretty well for an OLED TV at $4,500. We’re glad to see LG getting some more competition, as competition has a way of driving down prices – we’ll gladly take more affordable OLED TVs, thanks very much. Also, Philips was the only major TV manufacturer to unveil a new TV at IFA 2016, making it a shoe-in for our Best of IFA award in the video category. – Caleb Denison Wearables: Samsung Gear S3 Frontier We were impressed by the Gear S2’s debut last year, but Samsung has not rested on its laurels. The Gear S3 Frontier joined the smartwatch family at this year’s IFA and offers significant improvements over its predecessor. Samsung consulted Swiss watchmakers to create a design that feels and looks like classic wristwear. Coupled with the always-on display and a veritable feast of watch faces, the Gear S3 is easily mistaken for an analog watch, but it’s actually one of the most powerful and versatile smartwatches we’ve ever seen. Everything that worked so well in the S2 has been retained, including the innovative rotating bezel and Tizen interface, but Samsung also worked in support for Samsung Pay, more apps, a bigger battery, and an LTE option that allows you to leave your phone at home. – Simon Hill Share

I’m gonna leave a link to this, as well as everything in the bag, in the description below, but if you’re wanting to look this up on your own, it’s spelled N-R-G. Here’s what’s special about it. This is a bag built for gadgets. It’s ridiculously spacious, water resistant, and can charge  your gadgets when you’re on the go. More on that in a bit. You might be wondering why I called this the What’s in my Bag: Overkill edition, and you’re about to find out. As most of you know, I work from home, and creating tech content like this video is what I do for a living. What that means is, when I am on the go, it’s because I am leaving town - and that means I need everything necessary to keep the content flowing for you guys. Let’s start in the front pocket. Oh, and remember how I said this bag can charge up your gadgets? There’s a 7000mAh removable battery built in to this bag. It can be removed to be charged, or you can just open up the power port on the side of the bag and plug the AC adapter into there. The battery powers the USB port on the side of the backpack, which can charge up any smartphone or tablet. Even cooler, on the inside you’ll find built-in Lightning, microUSB, and Apple 30-pin charging cables, all of which are directly connected to the power in the bag as well. So, you are covered regardless of the device you have on you, and that’s pretty cool. MACBOOK Of course, when I’m on the go, I need my mobile workstation, and in this instance, that’s the 2016 MacBook. I’ve got the Rose Gold model with the upgraded 1.3GHz Intel Core M7 processor and 512GB of storage. I’ll be bringing you my review of Apple’s latest MacBook soon, but in my early tests it beats last years model easily. IPAD PRO In addition to the MacBook, I also keep a 12.9-inch LTE iPad Pro in my bag as well. Sometimes I just wanna use iOS apps to connect to my TiVo to watch shows, or stream Netflix, Hulu, or just play a game. Of course I’ve got the smart keyboard connected in case I also wanna get some work done... But yes, sometimes I don’t need the larger form factor, and therefore I ALSO have the 9.7-inch LTE iPad Pro with me as well. The larger model pretty much needs to be on a table or desk to be useable, and this smaller version is fine in the hands, and has that fresh True Tone display as well, which is great for reading. KINDLE OASIS That said, if I really wanna get some reading done without distractions or the temptation of other apps, I also have a Kindle e-reader in my bag at all times. RIght now, it’s the brand new Kindle Oasis, which Amazon just released last week. I’m a fan of this because it includes a leather charging cover, and a fully charged Kindle Oasis and Oasis case provides a ridiculous multi-month battery life. APPLE PENCIL Since I’ve got two iPad Pro units in my bag, it only makes sense that I’d also bring along the accessories that make the iPad Pro an iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is definitely part of that equation, coming in handy when I’m making those sick YouTube thumbnails on the go. PowerAdd Slim2 CHARGER This small charger by PowerAdd sports 5000mAh of power, enough to recharge a current smartphone almost twice, and it’s not too big to fit into a pocket if you need to charge up while using your device. It’s also not too expensive at all at just $10. ANKER CHARGER But when I need more power, or to charge more than one device, this Anker charger is my go to. It’s sleek and slim, looks great, has 3 USB ports, a built-in flashlight, and has an incredible 20100mAh battery on the inside. You can even use this to charge the MacBook over USB-C. NINTENDO 3DS I’ve got the New Nintendo 3DS to take care of boredom on flights, as well as to give me an opportunity to get some gaming in since I’m so busy as home making videos nonstop. Specifically, this is the limited edition Legend of Zelda Majora’s Mask console. CABLES Of course, I need to have every cable that I may possibly need, because, you never know, right? Ethernet, Lightning, microUSB, mini USB, USB-C, etc. I’ve also got some USB-C dongles for the MacBook, in case I need to plug in a standard USB device or HDMI cable. IPHONE SE - VRS Design Case In the back pocket found on the rear of the NRG bag, I usually store a couple of extra smartphones. I’m usually reviewing and testing multiple models, and this is a great place to keep them protected. Here I have the iPhone SE, although you probably wouldn’t know it due to the unique case. This is actually another case from VRS Design, which can also hold some card or cash. Just like the LG G5, VRS design makes some sweet cases for iPhones as well. I’ll have more on these iPhone SE cases in a future video, so look out for that one. LG G5 - VRS Design Case Here I’ve got the LG G5, the latest flagship from LG. I keep that on me  in order to compare smartphones when I am doing reviews on the go. If you’re thinking about picking up the LG G5, I’ll leave a link to my full review video for you to check out. Oh, and to keep it protected, I’ve got it in a case from VRS Design. This one is called the High Pro Shield, and it’s two pieces - one soft piece that protects the phone from shock, and a hard bumper that goes around it. I’ve been trying out a bunch of different cases from VRS Design lately, and I’m a big fan of both the look and the quality of their designs. In fact, I’ll show you another one a little later on. If you need a case for your LG G5, VRS Design cases start at about $11. HTC 10 This is the HTC 10, and if you’ve been following my channel, you know that I picked my review unit up from the launch party that took place in New York City a couple of weeks ago. I’m just about done with my full review of the HTC 10, and while you wait for that, feel free to check out my coverage from the launch party, as well as my picks for the top 5 features on this device. NECTAR GLASSES: Dank Depending on where I’m going, sunglasses could be a necessity. I like to keep a pair of stylish but inexpensive shades with me at all times, just in case. I keep my more expensive sunglasses in my car, so when I’m on the go, I’m all about Nectar Sunglasses. Here you see the Dank edition Sunnies, which cost just $30. Moment Case and Lenses Moment Lenses and the accompanying Moment Case are invaluable tools for getting fantastic photos and videos using my iPhone 6S Plus (which isn’t in my bag because it’s home is my back pocket.) You insert the iPhone into the Moment Case, which is communicates with over Bluetooth, and provides a nice camera grip and shutter button. I have three lenses, all of which are premium glass. One is a wide angle, one is telephoto, and the last is a macro. Earin headphones I’m testing these Earin headphones. They are completely wireless Bluetooth earbuds. No wire to plug into your device, and no wire connected the two ear pieces. They’re decent so far, but audio drop outs on one ear or the other can get annoying. Still, many think wireless earbuds are the future, so I’m keeping my eye on this space. LSTN Wembley bamboo earbuds These LSTN Wembley earbuds are some of the best in-ears I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, which is why I’m not totally sold on the idea of completely wireless buds just yet. I’m usually more a fan of over-ear headphones, but I agreed to try out the LSTN buds and was immediately blown away by how great they sound - and the bamboo wood construction is beautiful. They’re noise-isolating and electro-acoustically tuned to produce high-end sounds quality at any volume, and the real wood housing provides a rich, full sound. Even better, your purchase helps support LSTN and Starkey Hearing Foundation’s mission to help restore hearing worldwide. Belkin SurgePlus USB Swivel Charger The Belkin SurgePlus has been a lifesaver, and it has had a spot in my travel bag for about 8 years. It plugs into a standard outlet, and provides you with three surge-protected AC outlets, as well as two USB charging ports. WHen you’re in a hotel room and outlets are scarce, the SurgePlus quickly becomes your best friend. Mophie Juice Pack When I’m on the go and don’t need to carry my bag with me, I look to the Mophie Juice Pack to keep my iPhone 6S running all day. It does double as a protective case, but that’s not why I use it - I just wanna be able to go from morning til late at night when I’m at these influencer events, and the Juice Pack means I don’t need to find an outlet. Audeze EL-8 Titanium This might be my favorite thing in my bag - the Audeze EL-8 headphones. World’s First Headphones With Fully Integrated Apple Lightning Cable. The EL-8 Titanium headphones come with an exclusive lightning cable that streams a complete 24-bit digital signal through a high quality DSP and DAC to offer better sound quality. The built in microphone can be used for phone calls and is SIRI compatible. An accompanying Audeze app can be used to apply EQ and sound presets. For non- Apple device compatibility, the headphones also include a standard analog cable. PlugBug PlugBug piggybacks onto your MacBook Power Adapter, creating a one-of-a-kind, dual charger for MacBook + USB devices like an iPhone or iPad, or really any USB-powered device. A newer model includes five international snap-on plugs and doubles as an international, stand-alone USB charger for iPhone and iPad. SanDisk USB-C Dual Flash Drive It has 32GB of storage, and the cool thing is that it can be plugged into both standard USB ports, as well as newer USB-C ports like the one found on the MacBook. That makes it easy to get files from one system to another, regardless of which USB type it supports. There you have it guys, that was your look inside my tech bag. I’m curious what you thought - I know I said it was overkill, but do you agree? Do you keep your bag nice and light, or are you hauling around even more stuff than I am? Hit me in the comments and let me know. Also, big shout out to Ghostek and VRS Designs for making this video happen, you’ll find links to the their products, as well as everything else I showed in this video, in the description below.

Massive grants aimed at high-tech scholarships for girls and students of color. Longer parental leave perks for new moms and dads. Even benefits that pay for women who want to delay childbearing to freeze their eggs. Now a growing number of both large and small tech companies are borrowing an idea from Wall Street banks: The "returnship," which brings in mid-career women (and men) who've taken time out of the workplace to care for family, offering them a path back to the office. On Tuesday, a nonprofit called Path Forward announced that six San Francisco-based tech companies, including domain registrar GoDaddy, customer service software maker Zendesk and grocery delivery outfit Instacart, will offer 18-week internships for about 20 mid-career professionals starting in October. While the program is open to men who have spent at least two years out of the workplace as a caregiver, it is expected to be filled largely by women. It is aimed at helping interns confront the stigma they face about time away. Also tech companies get a chance to improve their reputation as places that too many women leave. "If you're wanting more women at the senior level, this is a way to jump-start that," said Tami Forman, the executive director of Path Forward. Forman said there's been enough interest from other companies that she plans to start two to three more groups of these untraditional interns (who, yes, are paid) in several cities early next year, each with six to 10 tech companies. The nonprofit was spun out of the New York-based email software firm Return Path, which started its own mid-career internship program last year -- Forman is a former marketing vice president there -- and now helps bring that program, which includes training and networking opportunities for the group of interns to other tech companies. Path Forward's announcement follows another recent effort by seven technology and engineering companies -- including IBM, Intel and General Motors -- to run internships designed for women who've taken time away. The programs at these companies began this year and are part of an effort launched by the Society for Women Engineers and iRelaunch, a "career re-entry firm" that runs a conference on returning to work sponsored by finance companies that have similar programs, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. The latter firm kicked off the trend back in 2008 and even trademarked the phrase "returnship." Carol Fishman Cohen, iReLaunch's CEO, said her conference acts as something of a recruiting hub for those existing programs, and "it occurred to us we should take the concept to another sector." She approached the Society of Women Engineers to establish a task force last year that would try and "replicate what we saw in financial services." In tech, she says, "there's a lack of women at every level of the organization and they're looking for more ways to hire more of them and fill that pipeline." Cohen said men are eligible to apply, but most applicants for the established programs have tended to be women in their 40s or even 50s who've left the workforce to be a caregiver. Some tech companies have long offered flexible leave policies or extended sabbaticals that help their own employees return after a break. But these newer mid-career internships, says Laura Sherbin, director of research for the think tank Center for Talent Innovation (CTI), offer certain advantages. For one, it exposes employers to outside talent. And in an industry like tech, where the pace of change is faster and more disruptive than in others, the low-risk bet on hiring an intern for 12 or 18 weeks can help erase the bias many managers have about people whose resumes have glaring holes on them. "There's a huge stigma to time off in the tech industry," Sherbin said. "There's a perception that tech passes us by even on a maternity leave, and if you've had time out of the workforce you're hugely behind. Tie that in with the bias you do see about tech workers who have a little bit of gray hair," and it's an industry particularly primed for managers who might look past candidates -- even skilled ones -- who have been out of the workforce. Steven Aldrich, chief product officer of GoDaddy, said that's one thing that attracted his company to the idea. "The company has a chance to try the employee, in a way, and see their fit with the company, and it's a win for the working parent coming back into the workforce to come in and get experience," he said. "Those things are really challenging [when someone] comes straight back in." The tech industry is also trying to plug an especially leaky pipeline. According to 2008 data from the CTI, 52 percent of women with experience in the science, engineering or tech fields chose to leave their fields over time. Another 2013 study, meanwhile, compared women in multiple professions and found that after the first 12 years of their careers, 50 percent of women in science, engineering and tech were working in other occupations, while only about 20 percent of the other women switched industries over their entire careers. Running internships for returning parents could also help send a message to younger workers. With these programs, Cohen says, "what companies are signaling to their youngest employees and the people in their 20s is that they understand that employees may take a career break -- and we want to welcome you back." If hiring rates are any test, such "returnships" appear successful. At Goldman Sachs, almost half of the 150 people who have gone through its program since 2008 were hired for full-time jobs; Cohen says that hire rates tend to be between 50 and 90 percent in established programs, and at the high end of that range for the tech firms so far. A spokeswoman for PayPal, which ran a program for nine interns in the U.S. called "Recharge," with the help of Forman's group earlier this year, said that seven of the nine were offered jobs. And all six of the "Tech Re-Entry" interns working in analytics at IBM this spring, who had been out of the workforce for anywhere from two to 10 years, were recommended for full-time employment. Five have accepted jobs and the sixth is currently in final interviews at the technology giant. "We're increasingly looking for creative ways to bring women back to the workforce who we know are incredibly competitive," said Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, IBM's chief diversity officer. She said the company is looking to expand the program. Still, while success rates for participants tend to be high, the effect such programs will have on moving the needle -- either for the number of mid-career women in tech or the number of parents wanting to get back to work after child rearing -- could be limited. For one, the programs tend to be relatively small. Several of the pilot programs included internships for just a handful of people -- GoDaddy is hiring three interns, and there were nine in the first group at PayPal -- and iRelaunch's Cohen says existing programs tend to number 20 or 30 interns a year. Meanwhile, the programs are largely limited to fields where job demand is already strong, such as tech and finance, and do little to help those trying to get back to work in struggling industries or those with an abundant supply of workers looking for jobs. Forman said she's heard of an effort to do a "returnship"-style program in the advertising field, but it didn't take off. "The problem with that industry and industries like it is there's 10 people lined up for every job," she said. And in those industries where they could help bring in a few more women, warns CTI's Sherbin, hiring them only goes so far. Even programs that hire every mid-career intern they bring in won't make much progress on diversity if they don't also work to improve "bro" cultures that are hostile or toxic to anyone who's different. "You may get them in," she says, "but they're going to be very very short hires. Diversity for the sake of having butts in seats doesn't do us all that much good."

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   Electronic Design Automation Market Share and Size, Trends and Forecast To 2020 According to the report, high research and development investments will be a key driver for market growth. R&D forms an integral part of the semiconductor industry (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 03, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global electronic design automation (EDA) market: Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Mentor Graphics. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Agnisys, Aldec, Ansoft, ATopTech, JEDA Technologies, Sigrity, Tanner EDA, Xilinx, and Zuken. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/374129/global-electronic-design-automation-market-2016-2020 Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Rise in number of fabless semiconductor companies will be a key trend for market growth. Semiconductor companies are migrating to the fabless business structure. This is a strategic decision taken by vendors as they want to focus more on the designing and development of their solutions rather than on the maintenance of the foundries. These companies are outsourcing their fabrication- and other manufacturing-related activities to foundries that are specialized in the manufacturing, testing, and assembling of semiconductor ICs. The resultant ratio of foundries and fabless companies stands at 1:11 in the global semiconductor market. The rise in the number of fabless semiconductor companies will increase the need for EDA software tools in the market, as these fabless companies are just concerned with the design aspect of semiconductor devices. According to the report, high research and development investments will be a key driver for market growth. R&D forms an integral part of the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry recorded its highest R&D spending of $56.4 billion in 2015. This, however, is not in lieu of the industry standard for R&D spending since 2010, which grew at an average of 13% on a yearly basis. The industry spending toward R&D was up by only 0.5% from 2014, which is the lowest the industry has witnessed since the downturn of 2009. The spending was also below the CAGR of 4% between 2005 and 2015. Intel, one of the leading chip vendors in the market, accounted for 22% of total semiconductor spending in 2015. This was the highest among leading players such as Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, and Avago Technologies and foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). An important aspect to note is that the top five R&D spenders were unchanged from 2014. Further, the report states that uncertain economic conditions will be a challenge for the market. The semiconductor market is highly dependent on expenditure by vendors. This high expenditure is mostly funded by financial institutions and from retained earnings of companies. The global economy is plagued with uneven market prospects currently. The exit of Britain from the European Union has resulted in the decline of global markets sharply. In addition, the Chinese economy is facing a downturn, which has resulted in the dwindling of the Chinese yuan against the dollar, making the outlook unpredictable. This is expected to affect the market largely as China is a hub of semiconductor manufacturing. The slowdown of the global economy will tighten credit facilities for market vendors, thereby reducing their profit margins. This may force them to cut their R&D expenses, including those on emerging technologies. As a result, the market for EDA software tools is likely to suffer a serious challenge in the form of uncertain economic conditions. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

The Ideapad 110 is aimed at first-time PC buyers. It comes with a 15.6-inch display of 1366x768 pixel resolution. Powered by Intel Pentium processor paired with 4GB of RAM, the laptop has standard connectivity features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB 3.0 and HDMI. We reviewed the Lenovo Ideapad 110 bearing a price tag of Rs 24,790 to see if it's a worthy budget laptop or not, and here is what we think of it. | TOI Tech | Updated: Sep 3, 2016, 11.34 AM IST Critic Rating3.5/5 User Rating3.3/5 The days when laptop computers used to be super expensive are long gone. Thanks to the advances in technology and dropping manufacturing costs, there are numerous laptops (from manufacturers both big and small) available across all price segments today. So even for those who just want a notebook PC that handles the basics right, there's no dearth of choice in the market And that's precisely the audience Lenovo is targeting with its Ideapad 110 laptop. Glancing at the raw specifications, the Lenovo Ideapad 110 appears to be a fairly decent option for those who are in the market to get their first notebook PC. But a capable spec sheet doesn't automatically equate to good real-world performance. So, is the Lenovo Ideapad 110 a laptop you should spend Rs 24,790 on? Read our in-depth review, and decide yourself. Design and build quality With a 15.6-inch display, the Lenovo Ideapad 110 is definitely a sizeable machine. Although the laptop is entirely made of plastic, the all around textured finish makes it appear more premium than it actually is. The back of the screen-housing module is largely bare, save for a shiny Lenovo logo at the top right corner. The top edge of the display has a VGA resolution webcam and an array microphone. READ ALSO: Lenovo Ideapad Y700 laptop launched at Rs 99,990 As for the bottom-module, its centre is where the full-size chiclet keyboard. Thanks to the display size, the keyboard also has the number pad to its right. During our testing, we found the keyboard quality to be pretty good, especially given the laptop's price. The keys have decent travel distance and provide good feedback. A horizontal speaker grille (of which only the centre one-third is the actual speaker) sits above the keyboard, whereas the trackpad (along with left and right click buttons) is below it. Coming to the sides of the Ideapad 110, the left has the power jack, Ethernet port, USB 2.0 (1), USB 3.0 (1) and 3.5mm audio jack (1). On the right, there's nothing other than a tray-loading optical disc drive and a Kensington lock. There's also a card reader slot placed at the front edge of the bottom port. Overall, we found the design and build quality of the Lenovo Ideapad 110 to be appreciably good. However, the display-housing module wobbles a bit while working on the laptop. Display Lenovo Ideapad 110 has a 15.6-inch display of 1366x768 resolution. Due to the low resolution stretching over a comparatively large panel, pixelation is visible in everything from text to images. Granted, it's unrealistic to expect a Full HD panel at this price, but we feel that Lenovo could've upped the resolution at least a little bit. That said, the display has reasonably accurate colour reproduction and viewing angles are good as well. It's also quite usable under direct sunlight, provided you max out the brightness level. In a nutshell, the display quality of the Lenovo Ideapad 110, while not the greatest, is pretty good for the price. Performance The Lenovo Ideapad 110 is powered by a quad-core Intel Pentium N3710 processor clocked at 1.60GHz. Sporting on-board Intel HD graphics, the notebook PC comes with 4GB of RAM and 500GB of HDD-based storage. While this does appear to be hardware competent enough for delivering good day-to-day performance, it still makes the laptop struggle at basic tasks quite often. During our testing, we found the Lenovo Ideapad 110 to be a bit slow at times. Opening up multiple tabs in Google Chrome caused the computer to slow down to a crawl, and the browser crashed on numerous occasions. It's good that the Ideapad 110 ships with Windows 10 (Single Language) pre-installed, but its hardware isn't adequate enough to run Windows 10 without issues. However, the Ideapad 110 handles other basic tasks like document editing just fine. Talking about multimedia playback, the Ideapad 110 delivered well. The audio output from the built-in speakers is clean, even if a bit on the quieter side. Full HD videos (both streaming and local) play as they should. Unsurprisingly though, the Ideapad 110 falters with 4K playback. To quantify the performance, the laptop scored 1835 in PCMark's benchmarking test, which is just about average. Lastly, let's talk about battery backup. In the course of our testing, Lenovo Ideapad 110 lasted around 3-4 hours with a fully charged battery. This is not exactly the best battery backup, but still decent enough for the price. READ ALSO: Lenovo launches Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air rival, Air 13 Pro Verdict Indian consumers today have plenty of choice when it comes to budget laptops, with both global manufacturers (e.g. HP, Acer) and homegrown brands (e.g. Micromax) in the fray. Consequently, Lenovo Ideapad 110 has got some tough competition. But even though it's a markedly good budget notebook PC, it's not without its downers. These include a low-resolution display and somewhat underwhelming hardware. In the same price range (or for a little more), you can easily get entry-level laptops from brands like HP which are powered by much better Core-i3 processors and have more storage space. However, those generally don't come with Windows 10 pre-installed and use DOS or Linux instead. To sum things up, if your computing needs are basic and you're in the market for your first Windows 10-running laptop, the Lenovo Ideapad 110 will serve you just fine. 10 BEST SMARTPHONES OF 2016 REWIND 2016 10 BEST CAMERA SMARTPHONES OF 2016 7 'BIG BATTERY' SMARTPHONES OF 2016 RELATED User Reviews & Rating 3.2/5 Average RatingBased on 4 Ratings 5 Stars1 4 Stars1 3 Stars1 2 Stars1 1 Stars0 Rate DeviceReview Device Review Device 1.0Poor 2.0Average 3.0Buyable 4.0Good 5.0Excellent Characters Remaining: 3000 Post ReviewX Be the first one to review.

Looking for a way to encourage your employees to show better results? The answer might be pizza. © AFP 2016/ JOHN MACDOUGALL Germany's New Civil Defense: Why Germans Urged to Stock Food, Drinking WaterIn his book, Ariely recounts an experiment conducted at an Intel  semiconductor factory in Israel. For the experiment, factory employees were split into four groups, three of which were promised a reward if they managed to complete stated goals by the end of the day. Members of the first group were offered about $30 cash apiece. The second group was told that they would receive a compliment from their boss, and members of the third group would get vouchers for pizzas. The fourth group acted as control, treating the task as a normal function of their duties. The results of the study showed that the small cash reward proved to be the least motivating. The cash group increased productivity by some 4.9 percent, compared to the control group. The group that was promised a compliment increased their productivity by 6.6 percent. It has been acknowledged that kindness is underrated in the workplace. But pizza proved to be the best motivator, as the group promised vouchers increased productivity by 6.7 percent. In a PBS interview Ariely suggested that the winning results did not stem from a desire for pizza. As the pizzas would be delivered to the workers' homes, it would make them seem "like heroes in the eyes of their families," he said. But who knows, maybe it is all about cheese and pepperoni. Or maybe the researchers will offer real money next time, and see how things go. ... Reddit Google+ Blogger Pinterest StumbleUpon Telegram WhatsApp 41 Related: Pizza Going Out!

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews Dell Inspiron 17 7000 review Hands on: Dell Inspiron 17 7000 review Not yet rated By Kane Fulton Laptops and netbooks  A flipping huge convertible with potential Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict The first 17-inch convertible laptop is a solid performer and a compelling option for businesses looking to show off their content while on the move. It's just a shame that the Inspiron 17 17000's considerable size and heft will slow you down in the process. For Large display Solid build quality Attractive design Against 1080p display resolution only Bulky Heavy Convertible notebooks that can be used as tablets or laptops bring obvious benefits, with the main upshot being that you only need to buy one device rather than two. The first type uses a rotating hinge design to flip the display around 360 degrees, while the second makes the display detachable - like Microsoft's Surface Book. Dell has opted for the first former approach with its giant Inspiron 17 7000 convertible laptop, and we can't help but thing it might have been better off going for the latter. There's no getting around the Inspiron's size, which is both its main advantage and biggest flaw. Dell's machine is the first 17-inch convertible, which itself speaks volumes. Folding over the the Inspiron 17 7000's base to switch between laptop, tablet and presentation modes is two-handed exercise, one that would be a worthy addition to any yoga routine. On the other hand, the Inspiron 17 7000's sizeable attributes get you a roomy display that simply doesn't exist on any other convertible - and it's a beauty. If your small business needs a device that will be used to show off company videos, or support materials for sales pitches, flipping the unit into tent mode (an inverted 'V') provides an instant monitor that takes up little space on the surface it's rested upon. That display also feels like a missed opportunity. Its resolution meanders at Full HD, which limits its usefulness as a productivity device and especially as a desktop replacement. There's enough room to multi-task comfortably, but office workers used to the extra desktop real-estate afforded by QHD or 4K displays will feel constrained by the lack of pixels here. On a positive note, you can use all fingers and thumbs to operate the touchscreen display, which is especially convenient when used in Windows 10's Tablet Mode. You also get a lot of laptop for the money. Dell is offering the Inspiron 17 7000 in two configurations, starting at £999 (around $1,300). That fetches you a sixth-generation Intel Core i7-6500U processor backed up by 16GB of RAM. Storage consists of a 1TB 5400 rpm hard disk drive and 128GB SSD, which Windows is stored on for fast boot times. For an extra £50 ($70) there's also a second configuration that serves up a 512GB SSD for storage instead. Design-wise, Dell's machine is attractive without trying too hard. its brushed aluminium chassis contrasts well with the display's matte black bezel, which positions a silver Dell logo at the bottom. There's solid build quality wherever you prod and poke at the machine's aluminium chassis, which at six pounds in weight is not particularly backpack-friendly. It's not something you're going to want to lug between meetings or squeeze awkwardly on a train table. The Inspiron 17 7000's port selection is decent, featuring HDMI (1.4), USB-C, USB 3.0 with PowerShare, USB 2.0 and a media card reader (SD, SDHX, SDXC). Communications features include Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. Keyboards have been a bone of contention on a number of Dell's high-end offerings in recent years including the XPS 13 and XPS 15, with only the Latitude 13 7370's excellent keyboard bucking the trend. Unfortunately typing Inspiron 17 7000's keyboard isn't a great experience due to keys with shallow travel, combined with a frankly huge wrist rest that forces you to moved your arms further forward toward the keyboard. Benchmarks Cinebench R15: OpenGL: 60.31 fps; CPU: 306 points Geekbench (Single-Core): 3,506 points; (Multi-Core) 7,138 points Battery test (1080p looped video streamed over Wi-Fi in Edge, 50% brightness): 5 hours 56 minutes The Core i7-6500U processor inside is no slouch, featuring a base clock speed 2.5GHz and 3.10GHz achieved using Turbo Boost. However, it's not quite as fast what you'll find in Dell's flagship 15-inch offering, the XPS 15, which comes with a Core i7-6700HQ chip that racked up 12,449 points in our Cinebench R15 Multi-Core benchmark. The Inspiron 17 7000 gets a dedicated Nvidia GeForce 940MX 2GB graphics which is a step above Intel's integrated offerings and more than adequate for web browsing, using a high-resolution monitor and low-level 3D rendering and multimedia work. Just don't expect to play games in-between work breaks at anything approaching high detail settings without lowering the resolution first. Early verdict The first 17-inch convertible is an intriguing one. You can't knock Dell's ambition with the Inspiron 17 7000, which offers solid performance, an attractive design and a large display that looks great with the device flipped into its various modes. It's just a shame that the display has such a low resolution, which seriously limits the Inspiron's potential as a desktop replacement device. It's limited as a laptop and too unwieldy and heavy to be used as a tablet most of the time, which positions it awkwardly as a mid-way device that excels at neither use case. An interesting, niche and ultimately flawed effort, then. What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Razer gives its Blades a Kaby Lake, GeForce 10-series bump The Ultrabook gets a faster processor, the gaming laptop a better GPU. by Peter Bright - Sep 2, 2016 9:54 pm UTC Login to bookmark 73 The updated Razer Blade Stealth. Razer Razer has given its gamer laptops a bit of a bump to boost both battery life and performance. When we reviewed the sleek 12.5 inch Razer Blade Stealth Ultrabook earlier this year we liked the looks, the Thunderbolt 3, and the price. But we weren't so keen on the battery life of the 4K system we tested. The updated version should make good progress in that department. Razer is updating the Blade Stealth Ultrabook to use one of Intel's new Kaby Lake processors. Kaby Lake is, all things considered, a pretty minor update over Skylake, but the new i7-7500U chip (2.7GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo) should offer a bit more performance and a bit more power efficiency than the i6-6500U (2.6GHz/3.1GHz) in the old version. The update's bigger win comes from a bigger battery: the 45Whr unit in the old system has been replaced with a 53.6Whr one. Even without any savings from the new processor, that almost 20 percent increase in battery should translate directly into a 20 percent increase in battery life. That's enough to get the 4K laptop snapping at the heels of its 1080p competitors. Prices start at $999 (£750) for a 2560×1440 system with a 128GB SSD, with shipping due to start on September 14 and preorders available now. The Blade Stealth's big party trick is connecting it to the Razer Core: a Thunderbolt 3-attached expansion device that can house a full-size desktop GPU. Razer is now adding the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 and AMD Radeon RX 480 to the list of supported GPUs, meaning you can quickly and easily add the latest graphics options to turn your Ultrabook into a gaming machine. Enlarge / The appearance of the updated Razer Blade hasn't actually changed as far as we can tell. Razer If you want the GPU inside the laptop, Razer has also updated the 14 inch Blade. This system still has a Skylake processor because it has a quad core chip, and the quad core Kaby Lakes won't be out until next year. But its integrated GPU has been boosted. Out goes the old GTX 970M, in comes a new GTX 1060 with 6GB of dedicated memory. This is now a desktop-class GPU—Nvidia isn't making dedicated "mobile" parts for the 10 series—but it doesn't seem to have had any impact on the Blade's thickness, still 0.7 inches, or weight, which still starts at 4.2lbs. Prices start at $1,799 (£1,350) for a 1920×1080 system with a 256GB SSD. Pre-orders aren't open yet, although you can "register your interest." Shipments should start in October.

Microsoft kills off its advance security notification service Or, put more accurately, Microsoft has stopped providing advanced security update information available to the general public and will now only make it available to those customers that have paid Premier support contracts. You might think of this as "security information as a (paid) service," but what I find rankling here is that we live in an age where transparency—particularly with regards to security—is all the more important, so Microsoft's decision here is particularly curious. The rationale for killing it off? "The vast majority of customers wait for Update Tuesday, or take no action, allowing updates to occur automatically." That's an excuse, not a reason. And this decision stinks. "Gadget Review: Lumia 535, Microsoft's first smartphone" I could have sworn that the KIN was Microsoft's first smart phone. This week's takeaway: CES remains as vital as ever Which is to say, absolutely non-vital. But if there's any good news that came out of Las Vegas this week, it had nothing to do with selfie sticks, personal drones, smarter-than-ever cars, or any of that other nonsense. It's that the PC is back, baby. Thanks in part to Intel's delayed release of the Broadwell chipset, PC makers were out in force for the first time ever at CES this year, showing off a new generation of touch-based devices that actually look great, perform well, and answer consumer needs. This is bad timing in some ways—it might have been nice for these PCs to debut alongside Windows 10, for example—but I'll take it. The PC has been the butt of jokes for too long. And this week's CES erased those issues nicely. "Five things we won't forget about CES 2015" And one million things we have already forgotten. Maryland provides Office 365 to all public school students for free Now this is the sort of adoption that Microsoft was looking for, and a nice retort to all those misguided school systems—including the one here in Dedham, sadly—that are handing out cheap Chromebooks like chiclets to the children whose intellectual futures they are forfeiting in the name of upfront savings. What the kids are really getting is Office 365 ProPlus, which is the subscription-based version of the Office applications for PCs and tablets, plus unlimited storage in OneDrive for Business. With quality PCs now available as cheaply as those soon-to-be-bricked Chromebooks, it's time for schools to wake up and smell the education. "Verizon has 'temporarily sold out' of all Lumia Windows Phone devices" Success!! Microsoft now supports Bitcoin payments on Lumia smart phones No one noticed, but Microsoft this week started letting users of its Lumia smart phones pay for apps, games and other content using Bitcoin, the "peer-to-peer decentralized network of digital currency," or what I think of as "funny money." The firm lets you exchange up to $1,000 in bitcoins into your account each day (I guess the value varies from day to day, like real money). And then you can redeem those cute little non-existent coins for apps, games, music and movies. Is this insanity? I think it's pretty close. "Xbox One And Xbox 360 Are Now Top Consoles For Porn" Microsoft, finally finding its niche vs. the PlayStation. Play old, DOS-based PC games ... on the web Like many my age, I'm curiously nostalgic about the early days of the PC industry, and I often think back on my experiences with early Commodore and Amiga computers, Atari, Mac, and other long-dead technologies. But thanks to a clever new web site, anyone can engage in a bit of nostalgia and play a growing selection of early, DOS-based video games for free. The Internet Archive's MS-DOS Games Software Library uses an in-browser PC emulator to make it all happen, and while there are some limitations—you can't save game progress, at least in the games I've tried, for example—it's still pretty fricking amazing. Wolfenstein 3D in a browser? Are you kidding me!? Check it out! "Apple, Amazon, or Google: Who Will Win the Battle of the Tech Titans?" Microsoft? Google plans to sell insurance From the "you can make this stuff up" department comes news that Google, the most beloved privacy invader in the history of mankind, intends to start selling ... insurance. Actually, Google already sells insurance: Its Google Compare auto insurance has been available in Great Britain for a couple of years in the UK, as it turns out. This actually makes sense on two levels. One, since Google knows more about you than any other corporate entity on earth, it makes sense that this company could insure you, since it will know how much of a risk you really are. And two, Sony sells insurance too. Yes, really: And Sony's insurance business is arguably the only reason this so-called consumer electronics firm is still in business. This is the end of times, folks. "For Sony Pictures CEO, cyberattack won't set studio back" I agree that crap like "The Interview" arguably does far more damage to this company's reputation. Apple earned $4.5 billion from mobile app sales in 2014 And that's just from the 30 percent cut it takes from third party app sales, meaning that total app revenue through the App Store in 2014 was an incredible $15 billion, up 50 percent from the year before. Which just goes to show you: The most impressive thing about Apple's customer base is their willingness to whip out their credit cards so frequently. (And that's a fact, by the way: Google's Play Store app revenues were about 60 percent lower than those of Apple's, and they have a bigger audience. Android users simply don't spend as much money as Apple's more freely-spending customers.) "How Windows was exploited in 2014" Early and often, I'd imagine.

The difference is that ios users are out there en masse while WP users are not there. 30% of nothing is... nothing.

Why don't we ever hear anti Apple 'tax' people talking about Mercedes tax, first class airline tax, Tag Heuer tax etc.... I think it's because obviously for millions and millions of people - you get some quality advantages when you pay more $. Hence, it's not tax. It's just quality spending.

Log In or Register to post comments ymcpa73 on Jan 9, 2015 All those things you mentioned are not currency but are discount programs . That's how the IRS treats them. You buy goods at a store and they give you discount on future purchases from that company. If you accumulate enough discounts, you will receive something for free. It's just a means to encourage more purchases from the company. A currency can be used to exchange goods and services from any company because it is widely accepted. I personally find it easier to exchange using cash or a credit card than to use either gift cards or bitcoin. Log In or Register to post comments dustmagnet on Jan 9, 2015 I was proud of Microsoft's transparency on patches, especially this past year with many security problems on all platforms. I could point to them and say, "See, this is the mature way to handle issues." I find the new policy disappointing and baffling.

By Owen Hughes September 2, 2016 17:32 BST Qualcomm hopes to see the first headsets based on its design on the market by early next yearQualcomm Qualcomm has announced an ambitious new virtual reality headset powered by its Snapdragon 820 platform that it hopes will form the basis of VR headsets from other manufacturers. Called the Snapdragon VR820 and created in partnership with Chinese electronics firm Goertek, the self-contained device will be licensed to companies so they can build their own headsets using Qualcomm's tech. Much like Intel's Project Alloy and Alcatel's Vision headset, which was also announced at IFA this week, the Snapdragon VR820 is a standalone device that works independently from a smartphone or PC. The headset contains a custom 64-bit Kyro CPU and offers a pin-sharp resolution of 1440 x 1440 per eye, aping the 1080 x 1200 screens offered by the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. It also uses Qualcomm's Adreno 530 GPU for "next-generation console-quality" graphics and boasts a refresh rate of 70Hz. What makes the headset unique, however, is that it uses eye-tracking to detect head movement and position, rather than external sensors: two cameras on the inside of the goggles pointed at the wearer's eyeballs and another two facing outwards, which will allow the headset to run augmented reality applications. This will be combined with the standard gyroscope and accelerometers to offer six degrees of movement tracking: up/down, left/right and forward/backward. The Snapdragon VR820 will be licensed out to manufacturing partners before the end of the year, with Qualcomm predicting, somewhat ambitiously, that the first headsets based on its design will be on the market by early 2017. The company hasn't name-dropped any partners yet, although one possibility is that Qualcomm plans to target its design toward manufacturers developing headsets for Google's Daydream platform. That said, the tech could theoretically be adopted by anyone, regardless of platform. Anthony Murray, senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm's IoT division, said: "The Snapdragon VR820 integrates key technologies and features for an exceptional VR experience and provides a springboard for OEMs and developers to usher in the next generation of truly portable and untethered devices that we think are necessary for mass consumer adoption of VR."

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Sep 2, 2016 at 9:26AM Image source: Getty Images. The Vanguard Wellington Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:VWELX) is the oldest balanced fund in the U.S., offering investors low-cost exposure to both stocks and bonds. The fund's investor shares have a track record of strong performance going all the way back to the Great Depression, and could be a good fit for a diversified, balanced portfolio. About the Wellington fund and its investment objectives The Vanguard Wellington Fund was formed in 1929, and invests about two-thirds of its assets in a diverse collection of stocks, with the other third in high-quality bonds. Most (but not all) of the stocks are dividend-paying, and are established companies that the fund's managers feel are undervalued. In a nutshell, the goal of the fund is to produce a well-diversified portfolio that can produce strong returns over time without a high level of risk. It's important to note that the Vanguard Wellington Fund is currently closed to new investors, except those who invest directly through a Vanguard brokerage account, according to the fund's latest prospectus on Vanguard's website. In other words, you can't just log onto any discount brokerage and buy shares of the fund. Current investments As of the latest available data, about 65.7% of the fund's assets are in stocks, 33.1% are in bonds, and 1.25% are in short-term reserves. There are 93 stocks in the fund's portfolio, and the 10 largest holdings are: Rank Stock Symbol 1 Wells Fargo WFC 2 Merck MRK 3 Microsoft MSFT 4 Comcast CMCSA 5 Alphabet GOOGL, GOOG 6 Chevron CVX 7 Intel INTC 8 JPMorgan Chase JPM 9 Verizon VZ 10 Chubb CB Source: Vanguard. How much does it cost? The Wellington Fund's investor shares have a relatively low 0.26% expense ratio, 69% lower than similar funds. Investors will need a minimum $3,000 investment to get started. It's also worth mentioning that for people who may have more money to invest, there are also Wellington Fund Admiral Shares (NASDAQMUTFUND: VWENX) that come with a lower 0.18% expense ratio, but require a higher minimum initial commitment of $50,000. These expense ratios may sound quite similar, but could make a pretty big difference over long time periods, so if you have more to invest, you may want to consider the Admiral Shares. Steady, strong performance The Vanguard Wellington Fund compares its performance to a benchmark consisting of 65% of the S&P 500's performance and 35% of the Barclays U.S. Credit A or Better Bond Index. Over recent time periods, here's how the fund compared to the performance of its benchmark indices: Time period Wellington Fund Return (%, annualized) Benchmark performance 1 Year 4.75% 5.59% 3 Year 8.30% 9.50% 5 Year 8.96% 9.73% 10 Year 7.40% 7.08%  Source: Vanguard. A few things to notice here. First, notice that the fund has underperformed its benchmark over the past five years. This is rather common for well-diversified funds during times when the market has performed exceptionally well -- as it has over the past five years. The long-term (10 year) performance is ahead of the benchmark index, which I tend to put more stock in since it includes the bull market of the recent years, but also includes the fund's performance during the financial crisis. Additionally, it's worth noting that the fund's annualized performance since its 1929 inception is 8.23% per year. The benchmark indices haven't existed that long, so there's no ideal basis for comparison, but the stock and bond markets have historically returned about 9.5% and 5%, respectively since the fund was created, which should theoretically translate to annualized returns of about 7.9%, based on the fund's current benchmark composition. So, it's fair to say that the fund has an impressive history of staying slightly ahead of its benchmark over nearly nine decades. And, while these returns may sound rather similar, consider that $1,000 invested in a 65/35 combination of stocks and bonds would have grown to $761,000 since 1929, while the same investment in the Wellington fund would have produced over $973,000. The point is that it's important not to ignore small performance differences, as they can make a big difference over time. Who should invest in the Wellington fund? One potential turnoff to some investors is the fund's bond exposure. For example, I tend to keep more than two-thirds of my portfolio in stocks, since I'm only 35 and have the time horizon to ride out the market's ups and downs. Having said that, the Wellington fund is great for investors who want to take a more balanced approach, or as a way to diversify an existing stock portfolio.

VR devices like the Oculus Rift give wearers the illusion of being in an entirely digital universe, whereas AR gadgets like Microsoft’s HoloLens overlay computer graphics on the wearer’s physical environment. The latest development in this exciting space is the acceleration of “virtual personal computing,” in which the entire PC experience is based around VR or AR. Instead of interacting with a computer or smartphone via a mouse, keyboard or touch inputs, virtual personal computing calls for doing so with your voice, hand gestures or a digital keyboard you might only see while wearing special goggles. One example of this concept is Intel’s Project Alloy, which packs a PC’s worth of components into a headset that can be used as a virtual computer. The idea is that instead of carrying a laptop or tablet, your glasses might deliver the PC experience virtually instead. Just put on some goggles, and a digital keyboard and mouse would appear in front of you, allowing you to write documents or enter data. (Voice recognition could make this even easier.) If you have used any recently released VR or AR technology, you know they can be useful for playing games or more productive tasks, like previewing a house you might like to buy. But using them to create a virtual PC for real productivity could be transformational, opening the door to new, difficult to predict modes of computing. For most of us, the only computing setup we have known is a PC that includes a monitor, keyboard and mouse. We cut our computing teeth on this model, and while the PC designs of the past have morphed into jazzy all-in-ones and ultra-thin laptops and tablets, the basic concept of using a physical or real screen, keyboard and mouse or trackpad is still the same. From what I can see coming from those pushing the AR/VR computing experience, they’ll bring something real to the table within the next three years. However, this raises an interesting question for those of us who have only used a traditional PC for most of our lives: Could we actually make the switch and have a virtual PC replace our “real” computers? That may be an easier leap for younger users, who have shown time and time again they’re willing to leap to new and seemingly strange technologies if they find some value there. But I wonder if us computing veterans will be able to accept, adapt and embrace virtual PCs. There’s no doubt in my mind that VR and AR will allow for better video games and power interesting new communications platforms. And virtual PCs may indeed be the next generation’s first introduction to computers. But that shift, as with any profound change, will certainly take some time.

A compact new modular PC has been designed by HP, in the shape of the HP Elite Slice. Then for those who can accommodate larger and more powerful desktops there's the rounded triangular and fabric-covered HP Pavilion Wave desktop. HP Elite Slice The HP Elite Slice is the firm's smallest desktop. However, thanks to modularity it offers some purposeful expansion options. When you buy the HP Elite Slice you will get certain base performance specs, the modularity doesn't extend to things like CPU, or graphics, for example. HP is selling the Elite Slice with a choice of 6th generation Intel Core Processor (up to 35W), up to 32GB DDR4 RAM, and various storage options. The modules on offer are as follows: HP ODD Module, for back up and so on HP Audio Module, with tuned Bang & Olufsen sound plus 360-degree speaker design and dual-microphone array HP Wireless Charging Cover HP Collaboration Cover, with capacitive touch keys for controlling Skype calls and so on For peripheral support the machine is equipped with two USB 3.1 Type-C, two USB 2.0, DisplayPort and HDMI ports, Ethernet, audio I/O jacks, plus optional dual-mics and a fingerprint sensor. HP recommends you streamline your workspace with the Elite Slice connecting to a 23.8-inch diagonal Quad HD HP EliteDisplay S240uj monitor that powers the HP Elite Slice through a single cable via the USB-C connection. So there's only a single wire required if you use a wireless keyboard / mouse combo. The HP Elite Slice is priced from $699 and will begin to become available later this month.   HP Pavilion Wave The HP Pavilion Wave offers "an exciting new design" covered by fabric inspired by my 1970s high school jumper*. Apparently the fabric was chosen to allow for broad-spectrum audio transmission. Like the Elite Slice, HP allows customers to configure this system with a choice of 6th generation Intel Core Processor, you can also select up to 16GB of RAM, and various storage options up to an 128GB SSD with 2TB HDD. For graphical grunt you can spec up to an AMD R9 470M graphics card. Inside the rounded triangular chassis is a custom motherboard, cooled by an upwards facing fan helping air circulate over the copper heat pipes, past the cooling fins. Peripheral support is via three USB 3.0 ports, one USB 3.1 Type-C port for data transfer, one HDMI port, one DisplayPort, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and a microphone/headphone jack. Cortana conversations, VOIP and so on benefits from the dual-microphones. HP suggests this machine is a powerful general purpose PC and a good choice for an entertainment centre. The speakers integrated in the space-saving design are designed to "project sound for incredible clarity at any angle". It includes audio by B&O PLAY. Dual monitor setups are supported for up to 2x QHD displays (or a single 4K display). The HP Pavilion Wave is priced from $549 and will become available from 23rd September.

Posted by ChewieJ - Fri 02 Sep 2016 13:51 Nifl They look rather nice. But only a R9 470M? Wouldn't a Polaris GPU have made more sense for this scenario? Its a home pc, not a high end one. Same idea as the one that MSI came out with recently but smaller overall size due to having a built in single speaker instead of a fan to help cool it. Posted by quantasm - Fri 02 Sep 2016 14:03 “two USB 3.1 Type-C, two USB 2.0” - it's a bit cheap(and silly) having USB2.0 instead of USB3.0. Why no standard 3.0 ports? Posted by Kato-2 - Fri 02 Sep 2016 16:21 Very nice designs, good to see some PC makers still make an effort, hopefully it pays off. They really should be sticking Thunderbolt 3 ports on those, they are the same as USB 3.1 and it at least leaves owners an option if they want to turn towards pc games. Posted by quantasm - Fri 02 Sep 2016 19:38 Also, where are the cables on the promo images? Seems like it's being advertised as a clutter free and clean solution but the ports available would mean additional adaptors and hubs to work with current hardware.

Reuters/Nigel Treblin If content remains the king who will attract millions of users into the Internet, then the realm on which the more business-minded of this growing online population will be the cloud. The typical cell device owner usually equates cloud technology as a convenient tool for file storage or social media monitoring, but the platform is actually more vital than that. As The New York Times pointed out, companies like Google and Facebook were birthed on the cloud, before discovering a way to make money through online advertising. Social media sites and e-commerce sites house their tons of data in the cloud. The same article also said that even large companies like Intel are reducing cost by doing transactions through the cloud and dispensing with the need to buy more costly infrastructure. Increasingly, more business start-ups are creating a solid foundation through that technology instead of just making it just one of their handy operational accessories. Daze Info says that the revenue for the cloud computing market will increase to US$127 billion (A$169 billion) by 2018. Dropbox, with a value of US$15 billion (A$19.9 billion), is the leader in 300 companies that are providing cloud services. Amazon’s cloud-based Amazon Web Services doubled its earnings the past two years. Cloud software startups have been attracting the eyes of major investors in recent years. According to the Business Insider , the biggest acquisitions were SuccessFactors, bought by SAP for US$3.4 billion (A$4.5 billion) in 2012; Yammer, purchased by Microsoft for US$1.2 billion (A$1.6 billion), also in 2012; and ExactTarget, bought by Salesforce for US$2.5 billion (A$3.3 billion) in 2012. Internet giant Google is also on the prowl to look for cloud-based startups that it can nurture and build into the powerhouses of the future; Beebop is its latest software startup acquisition. Cloud tech is booming because their market of business owners is increasing and are beginning to see the value of the tech in their respective enterprises. Rapidscale attributes this spectacular and rising growth to the fact that more than 90 percent of business owners who tried cloud services said the technology actually helped to drive their business. Virtual enterprises “The business landscape will be more and more internet-based,” says Gil Amelio, president of rising new tech company 5BARz International (OTCQB: BARZ) . “Management, document analysis, meetings, data gathering and storage, and communication - almost everything will have a cloud component. Connectivity makes this possible. Because cloud tech has to be available and functioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week, internet connectivity must be similarly available. Businesses simply cannot afford ‘internet blackouts’ or the sudden absence of connectivity.” The 5BARz network extender has proven to be an invaluable tool that guarantees constant connectivity to businesses, from the multinationals to the startups. This portable plug-and-play device can increase faltering cellular device signals within a 4,000-metre radius to a maximum five-bar level. Traveling professionals have used it to power their devices while in international conferences, creative meetings in distant towns, and in transit riding on vehicles. Startups in the United Arab Emirates are among the first to capitalise on constant connectivity and the cloud to practically run their operations while reaching out to customers all over the world. In the National article, one UAE startup, TeachMeNow, uses the cloud as a platform to connect freelance teachers from various countries with students who want to learn a vast range of subjects, from Arabic to chemistry. TeachMeNow gets a cut from every payment that each teacher gets from their student. Founder Thea Myhrvold says that the cloud saved them thousands of dollars that they would have used in costly hardware. Microsoft sensed the UAE startups affinity for all things cloud and soon gave them and other new companies free access to their cloud through their BizSpark programme. According to Trade Arabia , this cost-free access to cloud technology has helped small businesses in the Middle East grow quickly and scale to a degree beyond what their finances would have allowed. Data stored in the cloud helps the leaders monitor market behaviour, access and share information, and help employees work as a virtual team. Microsoft’s BizSpark programme is currently helping 90,000 startups all over the world. Many of them can be found in India, likewise availing of Microsoft’s advocacy to help new businesses find surer footing through cloud technology. Microsoft India Enterprise leader Peter Gartenberg tells Tech2 that cloud access has been helping Indian companies mitigate cost while laying the groundwork for more innovative products. Aside from startups, banks and financial institutions, hospitals, media companies, e-commerce companies, telecoms, and even government departments are migrating to the cloud. The Indian cloud market has been valued at more than US$700 million (A$927.8 million).

How a few slices can motivate an entire team by Gordon Hunt 2 Sep 201666 Shares What actually motivates your staff? A slice of pizza and a thank you, not some extra cash. That’s according to a new, novel piece of research. Faced with the option of a bit of extra cash, a pat on the back or some pizza, what would make you work harder? If you’re anything like those tested at Intel, then some pizza and a compliment are the clear winners. An experiment at the company’s Israeli facility saw staff divided into four groups. Each group received either the promise of cash, a compliment, pizza or nothing at all for increased productivity. A slice of success As reported by New York Magazine, said test produced some surprising results. From day one, pizza led as the best motivator, with those offered cash (the equivalent of around €30) performing the worst. Productivity initially increased 6.7pc for the pizza lovers, with those looking for recognition up by 6.6pc and the cash-hungry only improving by 4.9pc. From there, the margins widened, with those expecting money as a reward performing 13.2pc worse on one of the days than those promised nothing whatsoever. By the end of the test, the pizza and compliment groups had gradually reverted to productivity levels closer to those offered nothing at all, though both promises still acted as effective motivators. Those who would be receiving cash performed 6.5pc below their usual standards. The study, detailed in Dan Ariely’s Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations, may be trivial, but it reveals much about what we perceive to be important carrots in the workplace. Mo’ money, mo’ problems Similar results emerged in a 2009 study undertaken by the London School of Economics and Political Science, which looked at dozens of experimental studies. “We find that financial incentives may indeed reduce intrinsic motivation and diminish ethical or other reasons for complying with workplace social norms such as fairness,” said Bernd Irlenbusch at the time. “As a consequence, the provision of incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance.” Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Excellence in research for innovation and analytics One of Europe’s best IT workplaces Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share It’s not just performance that’s a worry. Keeping staff tuned in is also the best way to keep staff in general. Speaking at Inspirefest earlier this year, the founder of Hatch Analytics, Monica Parker detailed how best to create a motivated workforce. In a Hatch Analytics survey of 40,000 workers, it emerged that a sense of purpose was key. “94pc of the 40,000 people we asked said the more meaning their job has means the more likely they are to be engaged,” she said. Staying the course Releasing some control into the hands of staff, allowing quiet time for reflection and encouraging employees to develop real friendships with each other are three key ways companies can build a motivated workforce, too. “If you let go of the reigns, you will have a healthier business and healthier humans who work in the business,” she said. “If you have a best work friend, you will stay in the job.” A recent survey conducted by Aon found that more than half of workers are open to leaving their current job. The survey was conducted by Aon’s recruitment and retirement business, Aon Hewitt, among 2,000 US employees, with the aim of discovering what life is like in the modern workplace. 52pc of those surveyed have at least one eye on the job market for a potential move. Of that number 44pc are actively searching. Looking for jobs in tech or science? Check out our Employer Profiles for information on companies hiring right now.

First off is the Razer Stargazer webcam finally has a launch date, after initially missing it’s Q2 2016 window. The Stargazer webcam was originally announced at CES and for a full breakdown on the camera, check out our initial post here. As a brief summary, it’s an Intel RealSense 3D webcam which offers Windows Hello support for facial recognition based login, and it targets game streamers with the ability to use the RealSense 3D to remove the background from an image and only overlay the person into the game stream. It also supports 1080p at 30fps as well as 720p at 60fps, which is higher than many webcams if you want to do a 60fps stream. Razer has also dropped the price from the original $199 MSRP to $149. Pre-orders are up now, and shipping will be October 2nd. They’ve also updated their ManO’War headset with the latest ManO’War 7.1 model. It features 50 mm drivers for virtual 7.1 surround, and offers sound isolation and in-line volume controls. It has a retractable MEMS boom mic, and an included USB digital-to-analog converter for the PC and Mac, or a standard 3.5mm audio jack for compatibility with Xbox, PlayStation, or any other device. It will retail for $119.99 with pre-orders now, and shipping in October as well. Source: Razer Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 12 Comments View All Comments p1esk - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link What the hell is this? 1080@30? How about 4k@60? Or at least gimme 1080@120. And yes, I do have the necessary bandwidth. Reply Cygni - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link It's meant to compete with the dominant webcam, the Logitech C920, which does 1080p at 30fps. These are webcams. The Razer costs $150. There isn't a single $150 4k/60fps camera on the market. Also, we are all ever so impressed by your bandwidth, but uncompressed 4k 60fps video is nearly 711MB (big B) per second. Don't think you've got that kinda bandwidth upstream. Even lossy compressed 4k 60fps video is yuge, and if you are doing that much compression, why are you even shooting in 4k/60... in fact why are you streaming at 4k/60 on a webcam anyway? Reply p1esk - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link According to Netflix, I need to have 25Mbps to stream 4k movies. Assuming that's 25 fps, 60 fps would need 60Mbps. Now, video chat is much more compressible than movies (because the picture does not change much), so in reality I would need much less than 60Mbps for 4k@60 video chat. And guess what? I just did my internet bandwidth test: 391Mbps down, 124Mbps up. So yeah, I got plenty for 4k@60 stream. Reply hpglow - Monday, September 05, 2016 - link Your so cool. will you touch your own weiner for us. Reply Sivar - Tuesday, September 06, 2016 - link Your behavior is of an insecure 14-yr-old. I say this to inform you, not to deride you. I suggest you observe better manners. With that said, your comment expresses an incomplete understanding of video technology. Netflix uses well-tuned, precompressed HEVC video for 4K. No PC can encode HEVC in realtime in high quality at low bandwidth. Even a 10-core Broadwell-E cannot realtime encode with settings that would give you good quality at their bit rates, so a webcam, with its limited hardware, would of course have a much harder time. Now it is entirely possible to stream realtime 4K at fairly poor quality but low bitrates using dedicated encoding hardware, but such hardware is expensive and not in high demand. Why would 4K matter on a webcam -- a device usually used to check when the kids get home, verify the hours claimed by the cleaning crew, or record burglaries? Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, September 07, 2016 - link So that p1esk can "zoom and enhance" to 1024x magnification on the burglar's license plate, and then keep zooming and enhancing so he can read the dna pairs on the burglar that's escaped. That's how 4k works, right? Reply knutinh - Saturday, September 10, 2016 - link In all fairness, broadcast and "broadcast" are different beasts compared to point to point communications. While someone like Netflix can afford to use the very best encoder implementations out there, they have to encode one or a few streams offline for a million customers. This means that the stream must be resilient against poor network and poor customer capabilities. Customers must be able to fastforward in the video. A web camera working in a point to point scenario will have to worry about encoder cost. But unlike netflix, they only need to worry about a single, linear user. And the encoder can adjust to network conditions on the fly. Finally, the progress of video coding standards is such that by simply going for the next-newest standard, processing cost and chip availability is significantly improved, while bitrate required for a given quality may increase by, say, 2x. While a web cam can be used for surveilance, that is hardly the only usage. Nor the main usage in my view. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Tuesday, September 06, 2016 - link No 4K/60fps yet, but we are getting close; Action Cams such as the Xiaomi Yi 2 do 4K/30fps and 1080p/120fps and are $250 right now. With a capture card, particularly if it supports it is possible to use action cams (with A/V out) as "webcams", assuming the capture card has "DirectShow" drivers, which allows it to be selectable as a video-in source in programs such as Skype, like other USB webcams. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Tuesday, September 06, 2016 - link Correction: No 4K/60fps at $150* yet. Reply ddriver - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link They sure activated my hilarity unit with pimping the "no green screen needed background removal through intel's AMAZING realsense technology" BS while showing off the practically pathetic and laughable results. Seems like "realsense" will be even more unimpressive than I anticipated. More like "real non-sense". Not only does it ALMOST manage to remove the background, but it also manages to remove the actual person, but as a compensation, leaves behind fugly artifacts. Job well done!

Productivity initially increased 6.7pc for the pizza lovers, with those looking for recognition up by 6.6pc and the cash-hungry only improving by 4.9pc. From there, the margins widened, with those expecting money as a reward performing 13.2pc worse on one of the days than those promised nothing whatsoever. By the end of the test, the pizza and compliment groups had gradually reverted to productivity levels closer to those offered nothing at all, though both promises still acted as effective motivators. Those who would be receiving cash performed 6.5pc below their usual standards. The study, detailed in Dan Ariely’s Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations, may be trivial, but it reveals much about what we perceive to be important carrots in the workplace. Mo’ money, mo’ problems Similar results emerged in a 2009 study undertaken by the London School of Economics and Political Science, which looked at dozens of experimental studies. “We find that financial incentives may indeed reduce intrinsic motivation and diminish ethical or other reasons for complying with workplace social norms such as fairness,” said Bernd Irlenbusch at the time. “As a consequence, the provision of incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance.” Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Excellence in research for innovation and analytics One of Europe’s best IT workplaces Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share It’s not just performance that’s a worry. Keeping staff tuned in is also the best way to keep staff in general. Speaking at Inspirefest earlier this year, the founder of Hatch Analytics, Monica Parker detailed how best to create a motivated workforce. In a Hatch Analytics survey of 40,000 workers, it emerged that a sense of purpose was key. “94pc of the 40,000 people we asked said the more meaning their job has means the more likely they are to be engaged,” she said. Staying the course Releasing some control into the hands of staff, allowing quiet time for reflection and encouraging employees to develop real friendships with each other are three key ways companies can build a motivated workforce, too. “If you let go of the reigns, you will have a healthier business and healthier humans who work in the business,” she said. “If you have a best work friend, you will stay in the job.” A recent survey conducted by Aon found that more than half of workers are open to leaving their current job. The survey was conducted by Aon’s recruitment and retirement business, Aon Hewitt, among 2,000 US employees, with the aim of discovering what life is like in the modern workplace. 52pc of those surveyed have at least one eye on the job market for a potential move. Of that number 44pc are actively searching. Looking for jobs in tech or science? Check out our Employer Profiles for information on companies hiring right now.

Ensconced in its fortress at Place Madou, it can dispatch swat teams on corporate dawn raids across Europe without a search warrant. It operates outside the normal judicial control that we take for granted in a developed democracy. The US Justice Department could never dream of acting in such a fashion. Known as 'DG Comp', it acts as judge, jury, and executioner, and can in effect impose fines large enough to constitute criminal sanctions, but without the due process protection of criminal law. It misused evidence so badly in pursuit of the US chipmaker Intel that the company alleged a violation of human rights. Apple is just the latest of the great US digital companies to face this Star Chamber. It has vowed to appeal the monster €13bn fine handed down from Brussels this week for violation of EU state aid rules, but the only recourse is the European Court of Justice. This is usually a forlorn ritual. The ECJ is a political body, the enforcer of the EU's teleological doctrines. It ratifies executive power.  We can mostly agree that Apple, Google, Starbucks, and others have gamed the international system, finding legal loopholes to whittle down their tax liabilities and enrich shareholders at the expense of society. It is such moral conduct that has driven wealth inequality to alarming levels, and provoked a potent backlash against globalisation. But the 'Double Irish' or the 'Dutch Sandwich' and other such tax avoidance schemes are being phased out systematically by the G20 and by a series of tightening rules from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The global machinery of "profit shifting" will face a new regime by 2018. We can agree too that Apple's cosy EU arrangements should never have been permitted. It paid the standard 12.5pc corporate tax on its Irish earnings - and is the country biggest taxpayers - but the Commission alleges that its effective rate of tax on broader earnings in 2014 was 0.005pc, achieved by shuffling profits into a special 'stateless company' with its headquarters in Ireland. "The profits did not have any factual or economic justification. The “head office” had no employees, no premises and no real activities," said Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief. This may be true but that does not empower the Commission to act arbitrarily, retroactively, and beyond the rule of law. What is really going on - as often in EU affairs - is a complex political attack on multiple fronts. It is a reminder of why Britain must remove itself entirely and forever from the clutches of this Caesaropapist construction. Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, has a €13bn axe to grind, but he is almost certainly right in arguing that Mrs Vestager is making up state aid rules as she goes along, and has yet to produce evidence that Dublin granted Apple a sweetheart deal on taxes. "This claim has no basis in fact or in law," he said. "The Commission’s move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe," he said. David Fuller's view The EU’s contempt for democracy among its unelected officials and even its elected politicians has long been obvious to anyone paying attention.  The horrendous precedent for today’s flailing and foundering EU was the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, which I last mentioned in yesterday’s lead article.  This project led by Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand, basically scrapped the successful European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).  They were replaced by the European Union (EU), which the German and French leaders largely controlled. This remains the case today – Germany and France are the inner core of EU power, although it is clearly not an equal weighting in terms of economic influence.  Little countries such as Ireland have minimal influence within the EU.  This is why it has been smacked down by Europe’s Competition Directorate for the entrepreneurial audacity of its tax haven policies towards Apple and other US Autonomies.    The USA is obviously not pleased by the prospect of losing potential tax revenue from American companies, should the EU charges prove successful.  The USA’s most effective bargaining chip is its funding for NATO.  I suspect that Putin is smiling in the Kremlin.    A New Low Tax Economy Can Both Liberate US and be Socially Just   We should all be grateful to Brussels for showing us, yet again, why we are right to be leaving the European Union, an entity now irrevocably set on a course of long-term decline. There have always been two tendencies at work in the EU: one pro-competition, pro-market and pro-individual freedom; the other collectivist, centralising and madly interventionist. The latter faction won, spectacularly so. The EU’s proposed trade deal with America is dead, demolishing the argument that remaining in the EU would have been the best way for Britain to deliver global free trade; and now the European Commission is waging war on tax competition. Forget about the technicalities of the Commission’s allegations against Apple and Ireland: the intent is to preserve the high-tax, high-spending social democratic model, and that means crushing those smaller, weaker nations with the temerity to seek to make themselves more attractive to potential job-creators. As the EU shrinks after Brexit and globalisation proceeds apace, this is the economic equivalent of a new Maginot line, a doomed attempt at bucking international competition. But its ineffectiveness at propping up a discredited model ought to be the least of Europe’s worries. By retroactively changing the rules, it has introduced immense uncertainty into corporate decision-making, and not just for American firms. Many other investors are realising they could be next, they too could suddenly be landed with an entirely unpredictable, postdated tax bill. Contracts between companies and nations are being reopened; promises torn up, not by those who made them but by an unelected, unstoppable bureaucracy. Inevitably, Brexit implies temporary uncertainty, rattling the nerves of many big firms (consumers, by contrast, are pretty upbeat). The good news for UK Plc is that what little fleeting advantage the EU had gained as a result has now vanished. If Britain gets its act together, our kind of uncertainty – rebooting our society, politics and economics – will soon be seen as the good sort, while Europe’s will be understood as purely negative. How many City firms would, under such circumstances, still mull relocating anything more than a trivial number of their staff to Ireland or Luxembourg? At some point, the penny will also drop that France, Italy and Spain all exhibit high and rising geopolitical risk. David Fuller's view Remember David Cameron?  He held the Brexit referendum at an early date – June 23rd, because he feared the EU’s refugee crisis would worsen over the summer.  That was not a difficult forecast and he was right.  Moreover, I cannot think of anything that has happened in the EU since June 23rd which would not have hurt the Remain cause.  Most significantly, the EU’s retroactive tax on Apple this week will hurt Ireland far more than the successful company currently run by Tim Cook.  If the referendum had been scheduled for tomorrow or anytime thereafter, I think the Leave majority would have been significantly larger.  Eoin Treacy's view The gold mining sector has been among the best performers this year not least because it underperformed by such a wide margin last year and because the gold price has broken its medium-term downtrend.   Zinc, Lead, Tin Reach Highest Since 2015 on China Factory Data Zinc, lead and tin climbed to the highest in more than a year after China’s official factory gauge unexpectedly rose last month, signaling improved demand from the world’s top metal user. The manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 50.4 in August, near a two-year high, the statistics bureau said Thursday, up from July’s 49.9 and compared with the 49.8 median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The pickup strengthens the case that China’s economic stabilization remains intact even as credit growth slows and the central bank refrains from cutting interest rates. Copper was little changed in New York as traders assessed the prospect of strikes at two mines in Chile, the biggest copper-producing nation. “Metals largely post gains as elements of Chinese manufacturing data display some improvement,” Michael Turek, the head of base metals at BGC Partners Inc. in New York, said in an e-mail. “Continuing Chilean labor unrest could become more pertinent for copper.” Eoin Treacy's view Positive factory output figures from China represent a welcome development for the industrial resources sector which has been plagued by fears that the Chinese economy is in serious decline. Perhaps better economic data is a reflection of the fact that continued government support in the form of loose monetary and fiscal stimulus are having the desired effect on demand.   IBM's Watson supercomputer creates a movie trailer But perhaps the most beguiling, and subversive, aspect of Watson's trailer was how much it de-emphasised the monstrous nature of the human/nanotech hybrid. The irony of this entire project is that we have a film where a form of AI turns violent and kills humans, but the AI tasked with making the film's trailer ends up playing down that entire facet of the narrative. Aside from being a fun experiment in computer-generated creativity, this project also proposes a speedy alternative to a generally costly and time-consuming process. The construction of a film trailer is usually an intensive practice taking several weeks to produce, but this trailer took only 24 hours to construct, from Watson "watching" the film to a human editor delivering the final product. Making a good film trailer is a delicate balance between art and commerce. If anything this experiment still goes to show that a strong human hand is necessary even when producing what many would determine to be a disposable advertisement. Still, I wouldn't mind getting Watson's perspective on a few sci-fi films that vilify artificial intelligence. Maybe there is a Terminator trailer on the cards that sympathizes with Skynet or a view on 2001: A Space Odyssey where HAL 9000 is the film's hero? Eoin Treacy's view IBM is in the midst of redeploying its knowhow from a company that delivered hardware to one almost entirely focused on software/computing as a service and Watson represents a big part of that. Meanwhile IBM is also advancing the development of quantum computers where it already has a 5-qubit prototype that it hopes to offer third party access too shortly.   Fuller Treacy Money Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version The information provided on this website (www.FTMoney.com) is for the purposes of information only.  This website and its content is not and should not be considered or deemed to be an offer of or invitation to engage in any investment activity.  Nothing FT Money does and nothing on this website is intended to operate or be construed as the giving of advice or the making of a recommendation by FT Money to any investor or prospective investor.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming CES 2017 Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: Christmas Gift Guide Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / Computing / Laptop / Alienware 15 Alienware 15 0 shares Read Comments By Alastair Stevenson Updated: 02 September 2016 1 of 10 Summary Page 1: Alienware 15 (2016) hands-on Video Review 9 Pictures Best Deals Best Deals for Alienware 15 Hands-on with Alienware’s 15.6-inch VR-ready laptop The Alienware 15 was TrustedReviews’ recommended small gaming laptop in 2015, which is why I had high hopes for the company's 2016 refresh. Having had an opening go with the new laptop, it looks as though history may repeat itself: the Alienware 15 may be the best 15-inch mobile game station to arrive this year. Here are three things you need to know about the refreshed Alienware 15. Watch: Hands-on with the new Alienware 15 and 17 1. Nvidia Pascal goodness The 2015 Alienware 15 ran using an Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M GPU. The card was capable of 1080p gaming, but generally required you to make compromises on graphically intensive titles. The 2016 version fixes this and runs using Nvidia’s shiny new GTX 1060 card. As TrustedReviews’ computing editor, Michael Passingham, noted in his full Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 review, the card is a significant step up on the 960M. This is largely due to its use of Nvidia’s cutting-edge Pascal architecture. Pascal is the successor to Nvidia’s Maxwell GPU architecture. The tech originally debuted on Nvidia’s GTX 1080 GPU, but later trickled down to its more affordable 1060. Pascal uses a smaller manufacturing process than Maxwell, which reduces the chip’s fabrication nodes from 28 nanometres to 16nm. This enables Nvidia to fit more transistors onto a smaller piece of silicon, thus increasing performance while reducing power consumption and heat. Pascal is the main reason that there’s close to no difference between the 1060 used on the Alienware 15 and full on desktop cards – both have an identical number of CUDA cores and the same 6GB of GDDR5 memory. The demo unit I tested came loaded with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor and 8GB DDR4 memory running up to 2,667MHz. Other configurations will be available at launch, but Alienware couldn’t give me the full list of options at the time of publishing. I wasn’t able to run the pre-production machine through any of TrustedReviews' standard benchmarks during my hands-on. But the upgraded hardware should make the 2016 version significantly faster than last year’s Alienware 15. 2. You can use it to play VR games The updated hardware means that the new Alienware 15 is VR-ready and should work with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Gauging VR performance is always tricky – currently, there’s no easy way to count the frame rate or properly benchmark it. But during the demo playing games on the HTC Vive using the Alienware 15, I was impressed. Titles ran smoothly and I didn’t suffer any motion sickness during my 15 minutes of play time. This is significant, since while there were reports that some of Nvidia’s 2015 top-end 980M GPUs could run VR, I personally never managed to get it working properly. So the fact that the Alienware 15 can actually run Vive games is pretty impressive. If the laptop manages to maintain the performance I witnessed over prolonged VR sessions, it could become an ideal choice for VR headset owners that don’t want a giant rig in their lounge. 3. New case and upgrade options Alienware has had to tweak the laptop’s chassis to fit the new components. The result is a slightly wider, but “almost 25% thinner” case. The new chassis looks far sleeker than the 2015 model and build quality appears to be top-notch; the case is built of the same anodized aluminum, magnesium alloy with steel reinforcements as its predecessor. I didn’t get an opportunity to remove the rear of the laptop for a sneak-peek inside, but an Alienware spokesman highlighted that the company has redesigned the internal architecture to make it easier to pop more memory sticks and a new M.2 SSD into the laptop. This wasn't particularly difficult to do on the 2015 model, but the move to make things easier is welcome, and one that may help less technical gamers maintain the laptop’s performance. Alienware also claims to have updated the laptop’s cooling system. This may not sound like the sexiest upgrade, but it’s an important one. The 2015 Alienware 15 consistently ran a little hot for my liking. During prolonged gaming sessions the CPU and GPU temperatures would regularly rise to 90-92oC, resulting in a drop in performance. Elsewhere, changes are kept to a minimum. The 15.6-inch, FHD, IPS screen of the 2015 model looks just as good here – on paper, the specification is close to identical. Colours looked decent and the above average 120Hz refresh rate should make it an ideal choice for competitive gamers looking for a mobile frag station. Alienware also made a big deal about the 15’s new TactX keyboard. It has an improved 2.2mm key travel, which should be great for competitive RTS, aRGP and MOBA players. But to be honest, during my hands-on it felt pretty similar to the 2015 model’s keyboard. I failed to notice a serious improvement in performance while running the two head-to-head – although I only did basic typing tests and didn’t play any competitive multiplayer games during my demo, so I can’t yet definitively say there haven’t been any improvements.

Pricing hasn’t yet been confirmed, but Nvidia’s estimated starting price for a GTX 1060 laptop is $1,300, which equates to roughly £1,200 including VAT. Considering Alienware has a tendency to put a premium price tag on its products, I’d expect it to be a little higher than Nvidia’s estimate. This would put it on a par with the 2015 model, which cost £1,322 when it first launched.

It has a compact, robust chassis and the inclusion of a powerful VR-ready graphics card should ensure that it easily delivers excellent frame rates when playing 1080p games. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise come its release later this year, and I’ll once again be pushing the Alienware 15 as my small-form-factor gaming laptop of choice.

Seriously? So not for people who travel frequently for business or game on the go? Not for college students who need portability between classes? So Razer makes their laptops so thin NOT because of the above reasons, but because there's a huge market for LAN parties, right? C'mon bro... Hank Terrebrood October 28, 2016, 1:24 am This laptop has been out for more than a month and still no real review and benchmarking for performance and battery life? How does the 1060 perform vs. the 980/980m? Comparing the more recent card to 2 (3 counting the 965M?) versions back doesn't make sense. Radekan October 30, 2016, 9:53 pm Dell is not capable of fixing all screws inside Alienware. You have good chance if you buy it to have lose screw that will damage your motherboard or as in my case battery connector. My suggestion go with something else Thang Cho November 5, 2016, 8:49 am that's true. Dell purposes do that so you have to get a new laptop every 3 years.

The Alienware 15 and 17 are launching with a new design featuring a thinner chassis and updated internals, which will significantly improve performance. Alienware is calling the 15 and 17 VR-Ready, and to get there they’ve turned to NVIDIA’s Pascal lineup of mobile graphics cards with the GTX 1080 on the 17 and GTX 1070 on the 15, or AMD 's RX 470 8GB model. Since Kaby Lake has only just launched with the dual-core Y and U series, Alienware is still leveraging Intel’s 6th generation Core with quad-core i7 available. Alienware 15 The design has changed as well. Alienware has moved to a new hinge-forward arrangement, which puts the display hinge closer to the user. This gives additional room at the rear of the laptop for components and cooling, allowing Alienware to shave 25% of the thickness off of the previous generation model. They aren’t the only manufacturer to do this, and it seems to work well on other gaming laptops. The chassis is designed with anodized aluminum, magnesium alloy, and steel reinforcements. Alienware even pointed out they put a steel plate behind the keyboard to protect the laptop if you have a bad game and end up smashing it, although I’d still not recommend testing this. The keyboard has become a focal point with this generation, and Alienware has moved to newer switches which offer an impressive 2.2 mm of key travel. In addition, Alienware now joins the N-Key rollover club which means the keyboard can handle ten key presses simultaneously. For those that are into RGB lighting, Alienware does offer its lighting system, but it does not feature per-key RGB lighting. Another new feature is Tobi eye tracking built-in to the laptop. This has been available on other gaming laptops already, but for those unfamiliar, Tobi technology uses cameras to track eye movement. This can then be leveraged to allow partial or full control of some functions with just your eyes, which sounds a bit crazy, but in titles that support it there could be some nice benefits such as the ability to auto-hide the HUD in a FPS unless you are looking at it, but the most interesting thing Alienware mentioned in the briefing is that they have software which will track your eye movement, and then when you are killed in a game, you can then replay the kill and find out where your eyes were at the time, and perhaps use this to improve your gaming performance over time. If it sounds silly, just remember that eSports are a big thing, with real money available, so players will likely be interested in this. Another excellent side benefit of the Tobi system is that it is Windows Hello capable, so you can log in with just the camera. Alienware 17 The displays are 1920x1080 IPS panels, and the 15-inch model will be available with a 120 Hz G-SYNC display as an option, as well as a UHD IGZO offering, which is likely similar to the one Dell implements on the XPS lineup. Battery options are a 68 Wh and optional 99 Wh battery, which is pretty much the maximum you can put in a laptop. I wouldn’t expect great battery life, but with the new Pascal chips we could be surprised. Both models will continue to work with the Alienware Graphics Amplifier as well. I asked them if they were going to move to Thunderbolt 3 for this, but they said they get more bandwidth out of the proprietary connector and are not looking to change at this time. Both models will be available this month at Dell.com. Prices have not been announced yet. Source: Alienware   Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

I'd be surprised if they can block eGPU support on this one. And there's also a QHD Display option, not mentioned in this article. (2560x1440) Reply Flunk - Thursday, September 08, 2016 - link Alienware sells their own eGPU box, so I can't see why they'd block eGPUs.

Reply Wolfpup - Wednesday, September 07, 2016 - link Yeah, Alienware started this whole color thing-you can change it to bajillions of different colors. I set my Alienwares to an innocuous blue. Reply Cliff34 - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link Love to see the battery life on these laptops for everyday use. One thing I miss about the old laptops are great keyboards. :( These days every laptop is using chiclet keyboards which are horrible typing experience. Not that i game much but if these laptops (lower models) have a reasonable price point, i might consider one. Reply boeush - Friday, September 02, 2016 - link Can't help but wonder whether the screen forward design is less about cooling or room for components, and more about continuing to put stupidly tiny screens with too much width, not enough height, and huge fat bezels into premium 'VR-ready' laptops...

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Dell has given the XPS 15 a workstation-style makeover, and it's ready to do business. Just make sure you have a spare external battery pack, because you'll need it. For Compact dimensions Superb 4K display Fast CPU and graphics Against Shallow keyboard Windows 7 not designed for touch Poor battery life Dell's XPS 15 has been one of the true highlights in the 15-inch laptop space during 2016. It features the company's space-saving InfinityEdge tech, which slims down the chassis size by shrinking the display's bezels to mere millimeters. It looks great and is practical to boot, allowing the machine to be slipped into a bag for easy transportation, so it was only a matter of time before Dell launched a version that's geared toward business. Step up the Precision 5510, which puts the "work" into workstation. Essentially an XPS 15 that's had a workstation-style makeover, it swaps Windows 10 for the much more business-friendly Windows 7. And when it comes to specs, Dell has stripped away unnecessary features from the XPS 15 to bring the cost down. You won't find an SSD here, nor gaming-grade graphics. There are two configurations on sale, the first starting at £1,170 (around £1,550 or AUS$2,034) alongside a higher spec model costing £1,286. (around US$1,567 or AUS$). The latter ships with a slightly weaker processor but superior dedicated workstation graphics. The Precision 5510 is every bit the looker the XPS 15 is. Its two-tone silver and black design gives off an "Oreo" effect that appears elegant and premium. It's an exercise in minimalism for the most part, with nothing on the lid except for Dell's dark logo. The less-is-more approach is only broken on the keyboard base, where Intel and Windows 7 stickers have been lazily applied by hand. There's superb build quality at every angle, with the magnesium-alloy body standing up well to knocks and scrapes. Whichever 5510 configuration you opt for, both machines will weigh the same 3.9 pounds. That's the exact same weight as the version of the XPS 15 that comes without the dedicated GTX 960M graphics card, and it's pleasingly light considering the machine's size. It's just about light enough to lift with one hand, and you can flip open the lid with a finger too. Speaking of the display, you'll be hard pressed to find a better looking screen on a 15-inch laptop. There are multiple wins here - from the display's crisp Ultra HD resolution (3,840 x 1,440) to its impressive color saturation, wide viewing angles and high color accuracy thanks to 100% coverage of the Adobe RGB spectrum. Photographers and multimedia workers can feel at ease working with this panel. The XPS 15 was already geared toward professionals thanks to these qualities, so Dell hasn't had to tweak anything in this department. The display remains plenty bright, rated at 400 nits, making the Precision 5510's bold and vibrant display excellent for outdoor use. There's ample room to snap applications to each half of the display, and you can have multiple legacy applications open while having room on the desktop to spare. Note that the some legacy business programs might not play nicely on the 4K display if they're optimized, and Windows 7 is also a strange environment to prod and poke at the touchscreen. Productivity is a breeze on the Precision 5510 thanks to the computing muscle under the hood. Our review sample came with an Intel Xeon CPU E3-1505M v5 clocked at 2.8GHz, backed up by 16GB of RAM. Apps load instantly, and boot times are swift. Whether you're running demanding applications or multiple legacy apps, this laptop will be able to handle them without a hitch. We would've liked more ports, however, with including HDMI, USB 3.1 (Type-C), two USB 3.1 ports and a microSD slot being the only ones to be found. Unfortunately the keyboard, one of the less impressive aspects of the XPS 15, remains unchanged on the Precision 5510. It suffers from a lack of key travel, with each keypress leaving more to be satisfied. It's absolutely fine, serviceable even, for typing shorter documents, but wrist cramp begins to set in once the word count reaches into the thousands. On the plus side it's backlit so you can see what you're typing up in the dark, and it's twinned with an excellent Dell Precision clickpad that's as good as any on a Mac - a rarity for a Windows machine. Benchmarks Cinebench R15: OpenGL: 55.67 fps; CPU: 621 points Geekbench (Single-Core): 3,810 points; (Multi-Core) 14,059 points Battery test (1080p looped video streamed over Wi-Fi in Edge, 50% brightness): 3 hours 3 minutes The Precision 5510 gave out some impressive benchmark scores in our early testing, with the best result coming from Geekbench's Multi-Core CPU test - 14,059 points. The Xeon CPU E3-1505M inside is truly designed for heavy lifting and even scores higher than the XPS 15's Intel Core i7-6700HQ that achieved 12,449 points in the same benchmark. The 5510's graphics performance was only slightly behind the XPS 15, scoring 55.67 points in Cinebench's graphics test, versus the 69.46 fps achieved by the GTX 960M in the XPS 15. Early verdict It must have been easy for Dell to convert the XPS 15 into a workstation, such was its initial qualities. The Precision 15 5000 is solidly-built, surprisingly compact and lightweight for its size and comes with a fantastic display. We suspect that, like the XPS 15, the Precision 15 5000 will only seriously suffer in the department of battery life due to the power-sucking 4K screen. Still, for business users looking for a capable laptop that ships with the familiar surroundings of Windows 7, the Precision 5510 should rank highly. What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

Desktops are flying off the shelves, thanks to the popularity of virtual reality headsets among tech early adopters. Companies such as Nvidia and AMD have new graphics hardware that makes major leaps over older components, and there's even a small but growing number of gaming laptops that are ready for VR. The older Alienware design is on the left, with the new design on the right. Sarah Tew/CNET Alienware is joining that arms race with a pair of redesigned gaming laptops. The new Alienware 15 and Alienware 17 both feature current-gen Intel processors and Nvidia's new 10-series GPUs. That's important, as these new Nvidia GPUs promise nearly the same performance in both their laptop and desktop versions -- no more underperforming "M" versions of graphics chips. That means the Alienware 15 and Alienware 17 are ready for the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, despite being slimmer than the models they're replacing. The new design is subtly updated, with a thinner body, an inset hinge that gives the fans and vents more room to work without adding bulk, and even optional eye-tracking, from a company named Tobii, in the 17-inch version. The sleek, new Alienware logo. Sarah Tew/CNET If you look closely, you'll see one more important change. The Alienware logo, untouched for most of the company's 20-year history, has gotten a makeover. The iconic alien head is just a hair slimmer and more streamlined, while the Alienware name is now written in a lighter font for a more modern look.

Jim Barry did just that and pulled out a dozen gadgets from his black backpack last week. Some we’re featuring on the latest Tech+ video (at dpo.st/techvideos) Barry stopped by The Denver Post last week to mention a few new gadgets crossing his path as one of the gadget guys at the Consumer Technology Association — the organization behind the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas every January. Provided by Seek ThermalCompact thermal-imaging camera from Seek Thermal HEAT SEEKER — This tiny thermal-imaging camera from Seek Thermal connects to a smartphone. Working alongside a matching app, users can see the rainbow images on their smartphone’s screen where all the heat is coming from. It has a 320×240 thermal sensor and a temperature detection range of negative 40 to 626 degrees Fahrenheit. That could be fun if you don’t have night-vision goggles and want to see what wild creatures are making a mess of your garden at night. But for $499, Barry suggests something more useful: Seeing where heat is escaping from your home. Lower-priced models with smaller sensors start at $249 at thermal.com. FULL CIRCLE CAMERA — Barry introduced this round camera by contrasting it to the singular selfies. “You’ve heard of selfies? You can take an allie with this,” he said. The camera has two fisheye lenses to capture everything around it — up, down, left and right. But the marketers at IC Real Tech aren’t calling it a 360-degree camera. Rather, they’re calling it a 720-degree camera because it takes a full, 3-D sphere — that’s 360 degrees by 360 degrees. (That is, by the way, what most 360-degree cameras do too). Link this high-definition 4K camera to the mobile app and you can stream live video to Youtube. As Barry noted, it’s a chance to really see the secret lives of your pets. The $499 camera is available at allie.camera. Provided by IC Real TechAllie cameras, a “720-degree” full circle camera that captures the entire image. HIGH-RES AUDIO — When analog music went digital, music lost some of its soul and audiophiles mourned the era of the CD. But technology has spent the last few decades getting some of that sound back into digital recordings and adding in those lost zeroes and ones. A way to measure the difference? CD sound quality is in the 16-bit range while high-res audio aims for 24-bit. The differences may be hard to hear for some, but for true audiophiles, high-res audio is showing up in new products, like the Sony h.ear wireless Bluetooth headphones and the HTC10 smartphone. Provided by IntelIntel’s petite computer, the Compute Stick. Tiny PC — Intel’s palm-sized Compute Stick isn’t new but the company tends to update the chip and other tech specs annually. It’s essentially a regular Windows 10 PC on a largish USB stick. Plug it into an HDTV’s HDMI port and add a wireless keyboard and mouse and the Compute Stick is just like your old desktop but only 2.2 ounces. And it’s probably more powerful than your old desktop. Compute Sticks, which are available in Windows and Linux operating systems, start at $45.   Provided by WakaWakaWakaWaka Power+ rugged solar charger and flashlight. Solar charge — All sorts of solar charges are available to provide extra oomph for a traveler’s electronic devices. Barry likes the WakaWaka Power+ for its small size and added utility — its 100-percent recycled  high-impact resistant case offers rugged protection plus there’s a built-in flashlight. The company has a patent “SunBoost chip” and with the built-in solar panel, it  can fully charge a smartphone in about two hours. It even came in handy during our video as Barry’s phone’s power warned of low battery. A few minutes plugged in to the WakaWaka and we were good to go. The $79 charger is at us.waka-waka.com.

But first, it needs to come up with a useful product. Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 3, 2016 at 2:02PM Image source: Flickr/Creative Commons. Glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics, wrist computers that read diagnostic nanoparticles injected in the blood stream, implantable devices that modify electrical signals that pass along nerves, medication robots, human augmentation, human brain simulation -- the list goes on. That's not an inventory of improbable CGI effects from the latest sci-fi movie, it's a list of initiatives being tackled by Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Life Sciences research unit, recently rebranded Verily. For those who appreciate The Motley Fool's affection for William Shakespeare, "verily" is Shakespearean-era word that means "truly," or "confidently." As in: "I verily believe that sweater is the ugliest one I have ever seen." Confidence certainly exemplifies Google. Verily was hatched from Google X, the company's secretive lab for oft-nutty projects, such as space elevators, teleportation, and hoverboards. Google X also launched Google Glass, which was undoubtedly a super-cool device, but wasn't received well by its intended market, to put it mildly.    With that kind of background, what are the chances Verily will unleash something that will change healthcare? Are good things about to flow? Or -- courtesy of the Bard of Avon -- is Verily merely a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing? Let's look at Verily's current financial situation and then check out the prospect of a marketable product that could move Google's needle. A pound of flesh, but no blood   Like the moneylender in the Merchant of Venice, Verily demands a pound of flesh from its parent each quarter. Alphabet, Google's newfangled conglomerate, doesn't break out the performance of subsidiaries, but last quarter's earnings report offered a view into costs and output. Verily is a subsidiary lumped under Other Bets with Google's broadband business and smart home company. Revenue from Other Bets doubled to $185 million from $74 million in the year-earlier period, and rose 11% sequentially. Costs also increased: Operating losses widened to $859 million from $660 million a year ago and moved up 7% from the previous quarter. Despite the costs incurred, it's certainly not bleeding its parent dry. After all, Google has an almost endless supporting budget, and if any of Verily's projects pan out, what's being expended now will look like pocket change. In addition, while some Verily ventures may seem frankly nuts, they might have actual potential. A recent joint venture with U.K. drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) will use implants that create electrical pulses to help the body heal itself. The collaborators have agreed to spend up to $716 million over seven years, with GSK holding 55% of the joint venture and Verily 45%. It's a new field, called bioelectronic medicine. Despite the quasi-scientific sound of this endeavor, early studies reported in peer-reviewed journals have shown positive results in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Sanofi, AbbVie, and Biogen  have also teamed up with Verily over the past few years. Big pharma hopes to tap into Google's data analysis tools, as well as license Verily's miniaturized medical devices (after they are developed), to tackle various disease targets. In a slightly different kind of venture, Johnson & Johnson has inked a deal with Verily to develop medical robots. The less you speak of your greatness, the more shall I think of it   None of these ventures have led to a useful product yet. Meanwhile, Verily has been skewered by multiple scientists for not critically assessing the actual potential behind its various moonshots. "One needs to balance how much these toys are used mostly for marketing and giving a sense of a company really working on something impressive -- the brave new world -- or if we're talking about something that will have clear and immediate clinical impact. The latter is very hard to imagine," said Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of disease prevention at Stanford University, commenting on Verily's projects.  In the blink of an eye In light of that, what about one of Verily's oldest initiatives? Looking back to 2012, the life sciences unit was originally developed to create "smart" contact lenses whose super-cool images were appearing all over the internet a scant two years ago. Designed to measure blood glucose levels, the lenses featured sensors and chips the size of flecks of glitter and a wireless antenna thinner than a human hair. On the face of it, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) lens seems to meet Ioannidis' criteria of having a "clear clinical impact." Better yet: it has an investable thesis. Verily and its big pharma partner Novartis (NYSE:NVS) are aiming straight at the $10 billion diabetes monitoring market. With this kind of market, the project was clearly capable of becoming a needle-moving revenue generator. Look a little deeper, though, and the view is cloudier. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) Executive VP Steve Pacelli pointed out, "Lots of companies have tried and failed noninvasively to sense glucose in tears. You can measure glucose in tears, but the concentration is a lot lower, there's going to be huge time lag issues; the consistency of measurement is going to be a challenge." There's a bigger problem. Both Dexcom and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) have continuous glucose monitors on the market, but both face a major hurdle. The FDA does not consider continuous glucose monitoring -- from any device -- accurate enough to prescribe insulin dosing by itself. While CGM devices are being used, their market is very limited, since they are only allowed to be used as supplemental devices. Google's CGM lens will face the same FDA hurdle -- assuming this product comes out of the lab. The long and short of it Apple, Microsoft, Intel -- virtually all the tech titans, in fact -- are now pursuing major initiatives in healthcare. A confluence of factors, such as digitization of records, machine intelligence, genetic engineering, and rapid advances in medical equipment, have made the field ripe for disruption from data-enabled, mobile-based, and miniaturized devices. Even more enticing are the opportunities to massively grow revenue. The tech giants are billion-dollar companies, but healthcare spending is approaching $3 trillion annually in the U.S. alone. Looking globally, the World Health Organization estimates the annual expenditure at $6.5 trillion. Bottom line: Despite the big carrot enticing it, Google has yet to come up with anything that can lay claim to changing healthcare. Although Alphabet could be a potentially interesting addition to your healthcare portfolio, it should be added with the understanding that there are many other pure-play companies with a much clearer path and investing thesis than Verily. Still, let's allow Shakespeare to have the final word. While the bard makes an unlikely investment guru, he had plenty of useful things to say that have lasted through centuries, including: "Though this be madness, yet there is method to it." In other words, it may be that hidden within Google's craziness lies the seed of something that could still astonish us. And no matter what, we can be sure of one thing: The ultimate search engine will keep grabbing headlines with its latest moonshots. After all, we're talking about Google.

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) By Perry Stein September 3, 2016 Follow perrystein The idea started on an empty alley lot in Northeast Washington’s little-known Stronghold neighborhood. Brian Levy wanted to show those around him the benefits of minimal and environmentally friendly living. So in 2012, he enlisted an architecture firm and builder to construct a 210-square-foot house on wheels — a particularly chic structure with stainless-steel kitchen countertops and maple floors. It garnered media attention — a couple of spreads in glossy design magazines — and some quibbles from neighbors who had grown accustomed to parking on the empty lot. It also raised questions over whether the city’s zoning laws even permitted Levy to use the lot for his tiny-house experiment. Yes and no. He cannot use his micro home as a permanent residence. But because Levy and other local urbanists lobbied the city to loosen its zoning restrictions, new laws that they say are friendlier to the tiny-house movement are slated to go into effect Tuesday. These new zoning laws coincide with Levy’s latest business venture: He and his business associates have partnered with a Pittsburgh-based manufacturer to build prefabricated versions of the house and deliver them to customers in the District and elsewhere in the country. “We’re aiming to be the premier micro-house manufacturer in the country,” Levy said. “We’re a business, but we’re also mission-driven. We’re focused on helping people live more simply, more cheaply and more ecologically.” Micro houses — or tiny homes — are part of an architectural movement encouraging simple and sustainable living. The movement has gained steam in recent years as urbanists and hobbyists alike pitch the structures as a cheap solution to the expensive housing crisis plaguing many fast-gentrifying cities. There’s even a popular HGTV show based around the homes called “Tiny House Hunters.” But critics of the movement contend that it focuses on single adults and overlooks vulnerable segments of the population, such as families and children, who experience poverty — and are often on the losing end of urban housing shortages. [Tiny house, big benefits: Freedom from a mortgage and worries — and stuff.] When Levy built his tiny home — a glamorous trailer he dubbed the Minim House — he wanted to see what the response in the District would be. Designed by D.C.-based Foundry Architects, the house is “off-grid,” meaning it requires no outside electrical outlets or plumbing for water, sewage, electricity or Internet. He created a nonprofit called Micro Showcase, where individuals and classrooms can schedule tours. For a while, Levy experimented with creating a community of tiny houses on the lot called Boneyard Studios, which disbanded amid controversy in 2014. There was a rift between Levy and the two other micro-home owners on the lot, which included questions over the sometimes smelly disposal of sewage, since the homes are not connected to sewage treatment. The lot now includes four micro structures, a garden and other projects that friends are working on and which people can tour. Together, these projects showed Levy that interest existed in tiny houses and that the venture could be worth a bigger investment. He created Minim Built — initially called Minim Homes — where he and his two partners sold 88 plans of his flagship micro house for $495 each. Chris VanArsdale, one of the co-owners, said that he fielded questions last summer from interested buyers and that they considered selling. But ultimately they decided to see if they could create a business model around selling a version of the Minim House on their own. Customers can now order one of the houses — with or without wheels — for $71,000, plus shipping, and have it delivered ready for move-in. At 265 square feet and 12 feet wide, the Minim House he is selling is slightly bigger than the one currently showcased on his Stronghold lot. The company is hoping to sell at least one house a month in its first year. They said they already sold one test model to the technology company Intel, which used the structure as a traveling showcase for its products. The District’s new zoning laws would allow micro homes to essentially function as carriage houses in the city, provided the structures are not on wheels. Under the new regulations, it will be easier for homeowners to purchase a micro house for their back yard and rent it out. The old rules required owners seeking to rent out units to argue their case before the Board of Zoning Adjustment to receive an exception. Under the new regulations, the structures will be automatically permitted in some neighborhoods — such as Brookland and Chevy Chase, where there are larger single-family homes — as soon as homeowners acquire building permits from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. Eric D. Shaw, director of the D.C. Office of Planning, wrote in an email that with these new zoning laws, the city wanted to give homeowners more opportunities to have accessory dwellings on their properties. “Accessory units can provide additional and often more affordable housing options, can facilitate aging in place, and can help homeowners afford their homes,” Shaw wrote. [D.C. shift could make tiny houses more abundant] Levy said their target customer includes retirees looking to downsize, cramped D.C. homeowners looking for extra space or rural cabin dwellers. “It’s ideal for one, possibly two people, depending on how much you love them,” Levy said. “It’s low-maintenance.” It is also designed to be as functional and livable as possible, Levy said. There are large windows and a full kitchen. A cozy table for two pushed against a wall can swing to the middle of the house for an eight-person dinner party. There is a couch that can double as a bench for the table, and a 96-inch projection screen. A queen-size trundle bed pulls out when needed, and there are bookshelves, closets, a work area and a bathroom. And they are all small. Levy said it will take a maximum of three months from order to delivery. local Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

By Annie Karni 09/03/16 07:46 AM EDT Trailing Hillary Clinton since she became the Democratic nominee has been less about developing a relationship with the candidate and more like a sensory deprivation experience. | Getty Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Hillary Clinton has never felt comfortable with the traveling political press. As first lady, she would sometimes arrange travel for herself and daughter Chelsea separate from her husband, partly to avoid the protective pool of reporters assigned to the president. In 2008, she “fought tooth and nail,” former aides said, to avoid sharing the plane with her press corps and relented only when her campaign was running out of money and had to either bring the reporters on board or downgrade to commercial. Story Continued Below And in 2016, with plenty of cash and a winning position in the race, Clinton has managed to keep the press at arm’s length — preserving her private plane as a refuge where the only people around are her trusted campaign aides. That changes on Labor Day, when the reporters and their press-leery candidate will for the first time board a “Stronger Together”-wrapped 737 and fly from New York to Ohio to Iowa, and remain flying companions for the final stretch of the campaign. Her team insists Clinton is on board with the setup, despite her distrust of the national media. "She does understand that there is very good reason why it's important for everyone to be together in the thick of a general election,” said her traveling spokesman, Nick Merrill. “We're going to wrap the plane in blue and get on it together. There's a desire to be efficient and be able to do things a little more impromptu.” But closer quarters are no guarantee of a new level of access. “The times she'll go back and schmooze will be few and far between,” predicted one longtime Clinton ally. “She'll send other people back there, instead.” Indeed, trailing Clinton since she became the Democratic nominee has been less about developing a relationship with the candidate and more like a sensory deprivation experience. When she’s speaking at a fundraiser, reporters camped outside can sometimes hear a muffled voice but can rarely make out her actual words. When she’s greeting voters at a coffee shop or on a rope line after a rally, the former secretary of state often looks right through the reporters hovering around her, like they don’t exist. And when she does acknowledge their physical presence, she smiles through the questions barked at her and encourages reporters to sample a coffee, or a chocolate, instead. Ryan: Clinton's handling of classified information 'downright dangerous' By Bianca Padró Ocasio There are full days when the rotating pool of traveling press does not even set eyes on Clinton. In one instance last month, Clinton slipped out to Martha’s Vineyard from New York, ditching the pool of reporters assigned to cover her altogether. Certainly, the past month has been somewhat out of the ordinary for the campaign — Clinton has been on a cash dash, spending the bulk of the end of summer at private, closed-press fundraisers rather than public events. (Twice, she popped up to call in to cable television programs.) But there has hardly been a halcyon period of accessibility since she launched her campaign 18 months ago. As she enters the final stage of the race, sparking new hopes of accessibility onboard Hill Force One, here is a sampling from life on the road with Clinton, culled from the print pool reports for the past 20 days: Drowned Out By a Jet Engine, Aug. 31: Clinton’s plane landed in Cincinnati, from East Hampton, New York, ahead of her speech to the American Legion. On the tarmac, Clinton was greeted by a group of county Democratic Party chairs. But, “your pooler was not close enough to hear any conversations over the noise of the plane.” They Paved Paradise and Put up a Parking Lot, Aug. 30: Clinton hit up three big fundraisers in the Hamptons. While she raked in the cash, the pool didn’t have much to report on. “Pool was unable to hear a word of HRC's remarks at first cocktail party. She also took questions, which pool was also prohibited from hearing.” At an evening fundraiser hosted by Jimmy Buffett, Clinton was inside dancing with Paul McCartney, according to attendees. Pool reporters were stationed about 400 yards away from the house, “among the parked cars.” Basement Blues, Aug. 29: While Clinton entertained donors who coughed up $33,400 a head to attend a Hamptons fundraiser at the home of Jay Snyder, there was “no chance of your pool hearing Clinton here. We are being held in a quaint, but lovely guest house, while Clinton is in the main house.” Earlier in the day, there was a brief window at a fundraiser when the pool could hear Clinton’s remarks. That was quickly remedied. “Staff shooed us into a hidden room farther in the basement out of earshot.” Clinton told FBI she relied on others' judgment on classified material By Louis Nelson and Nick Gass Exclusive Interview with a Caretaker, Aug. 28: Clinton attended four fundraisers in the Hamptons. In Bridgehampton, pool “had a funny exchange with the man who described himself as the caretaker of the house where we waited. He asked when we were leaving to go into the fundraiser and see her. We told him no, we aren’t allowed to do that. He seemed incredulous.” Pool reported no sighting of Clinton the entire day. Intel Briefing, Aug. 27: Clinton attended her intelligence briefing in White Plains, while the pool loitered in a parking lot outside. Pool was driven out to Sag Harbor while Clinton returned to her Chappaqua home, post-briefing, and did not know her whereabouts for the rest of the day. Chocolates > Questions, Aug. 25: Clinton popped into Hub Coffee Roasters after a rally in Reno, Nevada. There, she ignored questions about Donald Trump lobbed at her from the reporters in the coffee shop. Instead, she encouraged them to sample Dorinda’s Chocolates. “It’s really good!” she said. Muffled Mumblings, Aug. 24: Clinton attended a full day of fundraisers in California, but at the end of a long day that ended at 10 p.m., “pool lost sight of the motorcade as it pulled into the hotel garage, marking a full day without a glimpse of Clinton.” While Clinton raised money at the estate of Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, the pool didn’t even catch a glimpse of the house, instead “we have to hold at a nearby restaurant.” At a fundraiser earlier in the day, "pool could hear Clinton's voice, but could not make out any exact words.” The Wave, Aug. 23: In Burbank, California, as Clinton entered Justin Timberlake’s mansion for a fundraiser, pool reported that Clinton “waved to us.” Also, a Jennifer Aniston sighting. 2016 Clinton advisers see multiple paths to a commanding win By Annie Karni Magic Johnson’s Driveway, Aug. 22: After a fundraiser at Magic Johnson’s house, pool “was able to see Magic wave goodbye to HRC from the driveway.” We Can Hear Her! Aug. 21: Clinton attended a fundraiser headlined by Cher in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The pooler was able to catch snippets of Clinton’s remarks, which touched on issues like infrastructure, health care, mental health and the fact that she plans to include LGBT people in her administration. “Friends don’t let friends vote for Trump,” Clinton told the audience. Martha’s Vineyard, Aug. 20: At a fundraiser on the island, attended by both Clintons, pool didn’t have as much luck as in Provincetown. “At one point we could hear HRC’s voice followed by large cheers, but nothing more.” Stranded in New York, Aug. 19: Straight from the pool report: “Clinton went out to Martha’s Vineyard a day early, without the pool. Although we had a pooler on standby in New York, the campaign told us about this development only after the fact.” Ignoring Questions, Aug. 17: Clinton ignored questions shouted at her about Trump’s campaign shakeup, while she took a tour of John Marshall High School in Cleveland, ahead of a rally there, one of her two public events of the past two weeks. Police Reporting, Aug. 11: Sitting at a Starbucks across from Clinton’s Chicago fundraiser, pool noted that “opposite us on Wabash Avenue a blue minivan is on fire.” Pool called 911. When Clinton departed about 90 minutes later, pool had “abandoned its position at the Starbucks on Wabash — opposite the charred husk of the minivan — to get a glimpse of her on the way out. No such luck.” Follow @politico Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Annie Karni akarni@politico.com @anniekarni This story tagged under: Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Elections Chelsea Clinton Donald Trump 2016 Elections Hillary Clinton 2016 Donald Trump 2016 Show Comments Politico Magazine Putin’s Real Long Game By Molly K.
