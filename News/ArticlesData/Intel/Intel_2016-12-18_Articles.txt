Here are some reasons why. Sarah Tew/CNET Wearable Tech by Scott Stein December 19, 2016 12:41 PM PST @jetscott Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Fitbit's latest earnings reports weren't good at all. Pebble sold itself at a firesale price (to Fitbit) and cancelled its future watches. Microsoft, Motorola and Intel appear to have halted (or at least suspended) their wearable product lines. The Samsung Gear S3 slid into the holidays with a whimper, not a bang. And while Apple claims it just had its best weekly sales of the Apple Watch ever, that comes after some deep holiday discounts -- and lackluster sales for the first three quarters of the year. In light of all that, it's hardly a surprise that sales of smartwatches and wearables are in a pretty significant downturn, according to a recent report by analyst firm IDC. What's going on? I've worn nearly all of the big new fitness trackers and smartwatches of the past two years. And that's why I'm not surprised that the market is cooling. The reason is simple: they're not doing anything new. Even with Apple's newest watches, don't expect battery life beyond two days. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Since early 2015, wrist gadgets feel like they've hit a standstill. Even the Apple Watch, to some degree. While some are better than others, none of them have risen to the must-have level of the hottest phones. It's not necessarily all bad news. CNET's holiday shopping survey said millennials were more likely to get smartwatches than tablets or TVs, at least. And, many smartwatches and fitness trackers I've tried in 2016 have gotten at least a little bit better than before, as well as more affordable. But here's where things have gone off the rails, and need to be readjusted for 2017 and onwards. Battery life has hit a wall Hybrid watches that cram fitness tracking into regular watches can push a year of battery, but with sacrifices. But for most other trackers and watches, the range is anywhere from a day to several weeks. Pebble's watches always fared the best, lasting up to a week compared to one or two-day watches from Google, Apple and Samsung. The Samsung Gear S3 added more battery to its larger design, but in wearing it I didn't see a ton of improvement. Most gadgets need regular charging at annoying and hard-to-predict intervals. Others that have replaceable batteries need to be unscrewed or detached, and it's surprisingly easy to forget. Some companies think they have solutions to improve battery life: the Matrix PowerWatch is said to use temperature gradients to charge, but we have yet to verify that lofty claim. 15 The top fitness trackers and smartwatches for the holidays Wearables aren't coaching any better, or helping give better life advice Remember when the Jawbone Up promised to help coach your life better? Or the Basis Peak? Or the Microsoft Band? Maybe you don't. I do. There have been many claims of "machine learning," algorithms that learn habits and help make suggestions, and data trends served up to assist. Right now, nothing really does anything like what was promised. Fitbit can suggest a bedtime, and convince you to achieve fitness goals... but smart coaching hasn't happened yet. The Apple Watch barely coaches at all. Samsung's Gear watches and bands send motivating messages, but no real analysis. Maybe these bands are hesitant to make suggestions on things that could impact health. Maybe heart-rate-based coaching hasn't evolved because wrist-worn optical heart rate sensors are inherently inaccurate, at least in a medical sense. Both the Apple Watch and Fitbit Charge 2 tried for breathing-based mindfulness apps this year, but neither does a ton for everyday wellness (at least, not for me). A few gadgets, like Intel's Oakley coaching sunglasses, are aiming to help... but progress has slowed down a lot. Wearables aren't sensing anything new beyond heart rate Throwing heart rate sensing on a wristband was the last major innovation in sensor tech on smartwatches and fitness bands, and that happened back in 2014. Watches and bands can't sense blood pressure, or blood sugar, or temperature, or intoxication levels or any other magic things. Maybe with plugins and other accessories, perhaps... but the dream of watches as magic sensor-bands has slowed to a crawl. Maybe the reason why Garmin, one of the few 2016 companies seeing a rise in shipments, has succeeded is because its running watches are far more targeted at specific users, or aim at shoring up functions like water resistance and GPS. Fancier watches, like TAG's, don't mean improved functions. Photo by Andrew Hoyle/CNET Fashion over function, to a fault We're so used to seeing fancy smartwatches now that it's not a surprise: it's boredom. Michael Kors has a smartwatch. TAG Heuer has a smartwatch. When does this all end? Apple, thankfully, stopped making its $10,000 gold watch. But its ceramic model still tops $1,000. Manufacturers have aced the hardware design of watches. The Samsung Gear S3 looks like a great, normal sports watch. The Asus Zenwatch 3 looks like a fancy watch. Fitbit took the fashion path and made lots of leather bands and golden bangles. Everything has bling. I'd take a better-working band over a fancy one any day... but function is hard to come by, and harder to ace. They're still dependent on phones, and can't live on their own There are some smartwatches, like the Gear S3, that can be their own phones. Sounds interesting, until you try one and realize that, at best, it can do a tiny fraction of what a phone does. Apps feel fragmented, too pared-down. It's hard to get information, or make things happen. They are, at best, devices to get quick reminders. (Battery life, meanwhile, is punishing.) That could change, if they were more fully featured hubs. Consider the Amazon Echo. Why does it feel so useful? Because, it can do just enough to be its own magic device. And aside from adding the occasional skill from the companion phone app, it doesn't require anything else. Smartwatches could be that way too, but they need to either have better voice-connected responsiveness or work seamlessly with things around us beyond phones. How would that work? Well, I have no good answers there. But phones managed it, eventually (remember when you had to tether an iPhone to your computer to activate it?). Maybe watches will need another handful of years to make that concept truly work. You can use the Samsung Gear S3 as a stand-alone phone, but I wouldn't recommend it. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Wireless networks haven't advanced to help these gadgets, especially in the home Suddenly, I've wandered out of phone range, and my watch or tracker buzzes. If I'm at home, on Wi-Fi, I might stay connected. Maybe not. Bluetooth 5 will double the range and improve speed on wireless connections, but it's unclear how that will help when everyone already has Wi-Fi at home. If you want to dream in a different direction, consider Wi-Gig. This high-bandwidth, short-range tech is being considered a killer tool to turn VR headsets wireless, or beam information across single rooms. The Neptune Duo was a bizarre watch-phone hybrid exploring how high-speed connections could bridge phone and watch in the future. That was vaporware, but maybe someone could come up with a better idea. Smartwatches aren't the magic wrist-superpower things we dreamed of Google Glass once seemed like it was a magic world-scanning lens. It wasn't. Smartwatches can, at first, seem like comic book magic on a wrist, suddenly connecting the world to our arms. That's still only part-true right now. I can see a lot on my watch, and feel connected, and track workouts, and scan my messages, and it's useful. But it's not magical. Not yet. They can't even do video calls. Watches need to do something more impressive than get messages and track fitness. People are amazed by the Amazon Echo. People are amazed by VR. People aren't amazed by smartwatches. Could they be? What would it take? If the industry can't get there, all the fashion designers in the world won't help.

Credit: Samsung More like this Review: 2 ultraportables from Acer and Dell add speed, efficiency Lenovo's popular ThinkPads speed up with Intel's Kaby Lake chips Windows 10 haters: Try Linux on Kaby Lake chips with Dell's new XPS 13 Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Samsung upgraded laptops in its Notebook 9 series with Intel's latest Kaby Lake chips, jumping ahead of rivals that are expected to announce new PCs at the CES trade show in January. The Notebook 9 laptops, which have 13.3-in. and 15-in. screens, are lightweight laptops with full HD displays. Samsung didn't share specifics of chips in the laptops, which will be unveiled by Intel at CES. Nonetheless, there are some things you can expect. The new laptops will be faster than older models and will have better graphics. PC makers are measuring an improvement of 5 percent to 15 percent in Kaby Lake performance compared to the predecessor Skylake. Integrated graphics will be able to handle video beyond 1080p resolution. The battery life provided by Notebook 9 models is about 7 hours, which isn't as high as others in its class. The laptops have up to 256GB of storage, 720p webcams and 802.11ac wireless. The 13.3-in. model can have up to 16GB of memory, while the 15-in. model has 8GB of memory soldered on the board. The 13.3-in. Notebook 9 weighs 816 grams, while the 15-in. model weighs 984 grams. That's even lighter than the Dell XPS 13, which weighs about 1.2 kilograms. The port options include two USB 3.0, one USB-C, HDMI and MicroSD. The 15-in. model also has one USB 2.0 port. The laptop pricing wasn't immediately available.

Imagination Technologies licenses its PowerVR graphics core designs to mobile phone manufacturers including Apple, which uses PowerVR in its iPhone 6S+ Credit: Peter Sayer/IDG News Service More like this Imagination GPU tech next year could power Apple iPhone 8 graphics Mobileye's self-driving car chip will pack a new MIPS CPU Imagination to battle ARM with MIPS server chips Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware It's been a rough year for Imagination Technologies. The CEO resigned in February, layoffs followed in the next month, and the cloud of being a takeover target hangs over the company. The company is best known as a provider of PowerVR GPUs for Apple's iPhone and the MIPS CPU architecture, which competes with Intel's X86 and ARM. Imagination has set its sights on a strong 2017 by taking an approach much like Intel did last year and refocusing on areas of growth, which include graphics and the internet of things. Imagination next year will release new PowerVR and MIPS chip designs, with the goal of driving growth in those areas. Imagination is following the path set by chip companies ARM and Intel, which have refocused their business around IoT. The chip designer has seen success in areas like set-top boxes, automotive tech, and networking, and it will continue to focus on those areas. But Imagination has the assets to succeed in emerging areas like virtual reality, and its technologies are already being used in VR headsets. Chip design business model Imagination has a business model similar to ARM's: It designs chips and licenses the designs to companies. Next year, Imagination will release the new Series8XT graphics processor, which will be targeted at a range of devices, including high-end phones and VR headsets. Apple, which is a minority shareholder in Imagination, could be one company licensing the Series8XT GPU. Apple tweaked the previous Series7XT used in the iPhone 7 and has used PowerVR technology in all iPhones to date. Imagination also wants to regain share in the mobile market as it expands the Series8XE graphics processor into low-end and mid-range phones, said Graham Deacon, senior director of business operations for PowerVR. That's a market Imagination has lost, with competitive GPUs from ARM and Qualcomm taking share. Imagination introduced Series8XE earlier this year, and the technology is reaching low- and mid-range devices. The goal is for Series8XT to be a harbinger of many new technologies, but all the GPUs will cram in more performance, Deacon said. New opportunities The PowerVR GPUs could find a place in infotainment systems and autonomous cars. There's a fair amount of research being done to tweak the GPUs for machine learning, Deacon said. There's also an opportunity in artificial intelligence, and Imagination is developing technologies and algorithms to tap into artificial intelligence uses, Deacon said. Imagination also plans to release new MIPS CPUs in the next year. MIPS CPUs have lost market share to ARM and Intel in the IoT market, but interest remains in the CPU architecture for cars, data centers, networking, and IoT devices. The company's strategy is to go after the massive volume opportunity in IoT and networking, rather than go after mobile application processors, said Steve Evans, vice president for business operations at MIPS. ARM has dominated the mobile device market in recent years. Intel recently quit making mobile CPUs, and MIPS hasn't found success. Only a handful of mobile handsets and tablets have used MIPS CPUs. But MIPS survives in other markets. Mobileye, which develops autonomous driving systems for cars, already uses MIPS CPUs. There are also many IoT devices, like low-speed LTE modems from Sequans and Altair, using MIPS CPUs. The company is also pitching the MIPS CPU for robots, drones, and other industrial applications. MIPS CPUs are also being used in wearables, particularly products developed in China. Imagination has targeted the MIPS CPU at servers in the past but with little success. But the fastest I6500-class CPU is comparable to the top-line ARM processor and is doing well, Evans said. While main CPUs in servers may be based on x86, there's interest for MIPS CPUs in the data-plane element, and companies like Broadcom and Cavium are making networking processors based on MIPS. Drones and robots Combining PowerVR and MIPS could provide a powerful chip combination for drones and robots. MIPS can provide the multi-core processing power, while PowerVR will provide the visual computing element, Imagination executives said. As the company looks to diversify into new markets, the cloud of getting acquired will hang over their head. But it's a public company with multiple shareholders, and it will continue focusing on what it does and won't be distracted, said David Harold, a company spokesman.

Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 19, 2016 at 11:35AM Image source: Getty Images. Though there are certainly some challengers, it's hard to find a hotter tech stock than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Heading into the finish line for 2016, AMD stock has risen an astronomical 275% in 2016, roughly 34 times the Nasdaq Composite's respectable 8% uptick for the year: AMD data by YCharts. No stock rises so fast without an underlying catalyst, and that is indeed the case with AMD shares. The company has done an admirable job making the most of its unique exposure to the computer microprocessor (CPU) and graphics (GPU) markets. So if AMD is doing so well, why is this article about better alternatives to its stock? Despite its recent renaissance, AMD's business model isn't necessarily as bulletproof as its 2016 rally might imply. As you'll see, other semiconductor makers hold stronger competitive positions in the two core markets where AMD hopes to gain market share. Consequently, here are two better semiconductor stocks than AMD today. 1. NVIDIA After struggling to find a place in the mobile revolution, graphics processing unit (GPU) leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has found itself unexpectedly at the heart of some of the most exciting growth markets in tech today. Self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and big data might sound like buzz words to some, but to NVIDIA, they're core markets for its high-end graphics chips. In fact, NVIDIA saw double-digit growth in the three business segments that cater to these markets. In terms of being more attractive than AMD, this leadership position in higher-growth semiconductor markets would be enough to make NVIDIA the better buy. Image source: NVIDIA. However, NVIDIA remains better positioned in the market where it competes directly with AMD, despite recent success on AMD's part. It's no secret that AMD has stolen some of NVIDIA's market share for desktop GPUs, but this overlooks two important facts. First, the overall market for PC graphics chips is shrinking in terms of unit shipments, making AMD's success in this space somewhat less appealing. What is more, NVIDIA's popularity among gamers, an enthusiast market that covets top-notch performance, has allowed it to continue to increase costs in the face of falling PC sales. Furthermore, NVIDIA is rumored to be preparing a lower-cost graphics chip to defend its market share from AMD next year. So for long-term investors comparing the two, NVIDIA is a better choice. 2. Intel Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, and a meaningful part of AMD's recent rally has been fueled by the assumption that AMD can steal some market share from Intel in one or both of these industries. Much has been made of AMD's forthcoming Zen CPU, which could offer graphics advantages over Intel's current chips, as Intel's chip roadmap appears focused on driving computing-performance improvements as usual. It still seems more likely that consumer preferences will be biased toward valuing faster computing power over moderately improved graphics. Looking at the bigger picture, Intel's massive resource advantage over AMD -- Intel's research-and-development budget is larger than AMD's total revenues -- should insulate it from individual design wins that might translate into a longer-term shift away from its chips. Intel might not be the growth giant that it was a generation ago, but in my eyes its financial muscle and strong tradition of execution still make it a safer long-term bet than AMD's high-flying shares. Foolish bottom line In many ways, this article is as much an argument for NVIDIA and Intel shares as it is a caution against AMD stock. As a company, AMD is undoubtedly improving. AMD has adeptly tapped into its core opportunity in the console gaming market, while looking to position its mix of computing and graphics know-how as an alternative to NVIDIA and Intel in their respective markets. Though this strategy could certainly work, it will be hard to dislodge either NVIDIA or Intel from their respective positions of strength. As we've seen in other consumer-hardware verticals like the PC market, cost advantages rarely trump performance advantages, so in this way AMD remains at a disadvantage to both Intel and NVIDIA. What's more, we're still early in AMD's comeback story, and the company has fallen badly on its face in the past. So while AMD shares have eviscerated the market over the past 12 months, it's far less clear that the company can do so again over the next 12. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

China gets creative By Zhu Shenshen | December 19, 2016, Monday | Print Edition CHINA’S consumer electronics industry was awash with new ideas and many surprises in 2016. Domestic products appeared with unique designs and popular features, sending a clear signal that the market is shifting from “Made in China” to “Create in China.” Still, foreign manufacturers haven’t given up the ghost. Long queues awaited the new iPhone and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor elicited heavy promotion in China. US-based Apple and Qualcomm remain the two most profitable firms in the smartphone industry, even though China is the world’s biggest market and manufacturing base for the phones. It all reminds me of the computer industry in past decades, which was dominated by US-based Microsoft and Intel. Inclusion of Intel processors on computers once guided purchases as much as the names of the manufacturers themselves, such as Lenovo or Dell. China has begun to emerge as a manufacturer in its own right, with smartphone chips developed by Huawei, drones by DJI, selfie phones by Oppo and Vivo, smart accessories by Xiaomi and user-friendly TV by LeShi. Some of these homegrown products are even making a splash globally. On auction websites, consumers have to pay an extra 500-1,500 yuan (US$72-$217) to buy popular gadgets developed locally, such as Huawei’s Mate 9, DJI’s Mavic Pro and Xiaomi’s Mi Mix. All these products were sold out immediately after their debut. The IT website Verge called the information-technology component market in the southern city of Shenzhen “the world’s most amazing gadget creator.” That praise came after a visit to Huangqiangbei, which used to be a center for cheap copies of iPhones but now is a center of new ideas and original prototypes. Domestic brands that once relied on cheap prices and annoying advertising are now basing their strategies on well-designed, user-friendly devices to woo consumers. In my opinion, that bodes well for the future of the industry. Top Chinese dot-com firms like Qihoo 360 and Baidu also have expanded into hardware sectors, turning out products such as children’s smart watch with Qihoo 360 security features and Baidu’s prototype self-driving cars using data analysis and artificial intelligence. And no one can deny that LeShi’s content and interface advantages in the smart TV market are raising eyebrows, though the ambitious company’s expansion in smartphones and auto faces capital shortfalls. Some sectors, such as virtual reality and robotics, seem to have gotten ahead of themselves in 2016. They still lack truly innovative, popular products created in China, though they have attracted considerable venture capital investment and media headlines this year. I predict these technologies will first find their niche in industrial sectors before entering households. Here are some domestic innovations worth noting as the year draws to an end. XIAOMI gadgetry THIS wasn’t what could be called “the year of Xiaomi” because the company’s smartphone sales came in smaller than expected because of competition from Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Still, I think Xiaomi maintains a noteworthy “empire” different from other smartphone brands. Its various gadgets range from routers to set-top boxes and wiring boards. It offers users reliable quality products at low prices, which can connect to smartphones with Xiaomi applications. Its set-top box has sold well both in China and the United States. In 2016, Xiaomi launched a concept smartphone called Mi Mix, with what has been called an “insane looking” full-screen design. People can already buy and use it, though the phone is still in limited production. Tipping point: Xiaomi products help people connect smart devices and offer content and services to households, rather than to individuals. Connected devices are expected to help Xiaomi gain market advantage and probably greater income in the future. Xiaomi is not basing its future only on Chinese smartphone sales. Instead, it has plans to play an important role in the connected “smart homes” of the future in China. Oppo & Vivo’s phones for selfie and music fans  OPPO and Vivo overtook Huawei and Xiaomi to become the best-selling mobile phone brands in China in the third quarter, according to research firm International Data Corp. Oppo and Vivo, both owned by Guangzhou-based BBK Electronics, surprised both the media and the information technology industry this year. They have opened thousands of stores in smaller towns and cities in the recent years, building up considerable market shares. Besides strong distribution networks, the companies have invested heavily in features that Apple and Samsung have yet to offer. The rapid battery-charging, powerful front camera for selfie fans and lossless-quality music playing on smartphones have attracted millions of young consumers. With their enhanced marketing positions, the firms have tended to technology research and development in the upstream chain. Oppo has co-developed a camera sensor with Sony, featuring faster focus and better performance in dark environments. Tipping point: Oppo and Vivo didn’t follow the trend of heavy reliance on the Internet to sell smartphones in the past two years. Rather, they focused on the ultimate demands of consumers for quality music and photography, according to Vivo Vice President Ni Xudong. Both companies also haven’t staged public events to reveal detailed sales figures and targets. Instead, they invite film stars, models and other celebrities to promote their products, which proved a hit with young consumers. DJI drones  DJI, the world’s top drone maker, opened its first flagship store in Shanghai two weeks ago, its fourth outlet after stores in Shenzhen, Seoul and Hong Kong. Long queues for DJI’s new foldable drone Mavic Pro reminded me the long queues in front of the Pudong Apple store for the Chinese debut of the iPhone 5 several years ago. Vice President Paul Xu said Shanghai is strategic for DJI because it is a market full of young, fashionable consumers who like new gadgets and technologies. DJI is expected to improve its domestic market revenue to 20 percent of income this year, which would be double that of 2015. Tipping point: DJI is often called the “Apple of the drone market.” It has developed its own flying balance and picture transmission technologies, and established global brand awareness. More importantly, it is aggressively looking forward with plans to expand in the domestic market and in industrial sectors, with products like its new drone for agricultural use, which I believe has great market potential in China. Huawei’s Kirin processor  HUAWEI aims to sell 140 million smartphones this year, up from 100 million units in 2015. They include popular models costing more than 3,000 yuan, which makes the company a competitive player in the high-end segment dominated by Samsung and Apple. The self-developed processor Kirin is used in Huawei models like the P9 and Mate 9, offering features like multi-task operation, image processing, battery management and support of virtual reality. Tipping point: Sales figures aside, Huawei is now one of a few handset firms in China to design mobile processors on its own, just like Samsung and Apple. Kirin takes its name from a Chinese legendary beast that symbolizes good luck and nobility.

Dota 2 7.00 Benchmarks - Intel Vulkan vs. OpenGL On Linux - Mesa 13.1 + Linux 4.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 19 December 2016 at 12:00 AM EST. 8 Comments In addition to big end-of-year AMD Radeon Linux benchmarks and the forthcoming NVIDIA data points among other interesting EOY comparisons, there is also ongoing fresh Intel Linux benchmarks as we end out 2016. For your viewing pleasure today are the latest Intel OpenGL vs. Vulkan Linux benchmark results using last week's Dota 2 7.00 game release. Last week were some fresh AMD Dota 2 benchmarks while here are the numbers from Dota 2 with Intel Skylake HD Graphics 530 as of this weekend. Testing was done with the Linux 4.9 kernel and Mesa 13.1-devel as of this past week from the Padoka PPA on Ubuntu 16.10. Beyond the OpenGL vs. Vulkan renderer tests at a variety of resolutions, the CPU usage was also monitored -- done automatically of course via the Phoronix Test Suite with having set the MONITOR=cpu.usage environment variable prior to initiating the tests. At the very laxed resolution of 800 x 600, the ANV Vulkan vs. i965 Mesa driver performance on the HD Graphics 530 is basically the same. The CPU average ends up being close between the two drivers and renderer implementations for Dota 2. But as the resolution increased, the Vulkan performance with the current ANV driver code was quicker to drop than the mature Intel OpenGL Mesa driver. At 1080p the CPU usage was around the same. Really stressing current-gen Intel graphics at 4K... Though the CPU usage did appear lower, albeit current Intel graphics hardware isn't meant for 4K gaming.

Although the Core i5-6200U SoC is over a year old, the system is efficient and surprisingly affordable at $165 for the 6100U and $320 for the 6200U. I've been using the latter as my day to day HTPC since August and it's been doing a fantastic job, so I didn't expect it to be replaced a few months later. Nonetheless, Asrock has sent an updated Beebox-S model sporting Intel's new 7th-generation processor based on the Kaby Lake-U architecture.  Rather than look at the Beebox-S 7200U in detail, we're going to focus on the upgrade to Kaby Lake as this is the only notable change. Which one's which? While our official Intel Kaby Lake desktop coverage can't be published until early next month, the mobile and low-power processors have been out in the wild for a few months now. With the arrival of this new Beebox-S, we thought it would be interesting to run benchmarks against the previous model. Both use low powered 15-watt U-series parts and with the Core i5-7200U effectively replacing the i5-6200U, it makes for an ideal comparison. Before we jump to the benchmarks, let's touch on the improvements you can expect from the new 7th-gen Core chip. Intel has made some tweaks to its 14nm process for additional performance, including an improved fin profile and transistor channel strain. These claim to deliver a ~12% processing performance improvement, which should make Kaby Lake more efficient when combined with architectural gains. Back in August, Intel's press material suggested that Kaby Lake would bring around 25% better performance per watt than Skylake. Intel also reported double-digit gains when comparing the new Core i7-7500U to the Core i7-6500U: 12% better "productivity" and 19% better web performance. That said, at the time we noted that a good portion of these gains could be attributed to Kaby Lake's higher clock speeds rather than pure IPC improvements. One of the major upgrades in Kaby Lake is an improved media engine built upon the company's Gen9 graphics architecture. The Multi-Format Codec (MFX) has been upgraded to support the latest media standards, including 4K 10-bit HEVC decode/encode, 10-bit VP9 decode, and 8-bit VP9 encode. The Video Quality Engine (VQE) also sees improvements, bringing HDR tone mapping and Wide Color Gamut (Rec.2020) support. Thus on paper the biggest difference between 7200U and 6200U is clock speed. The Core i5-7200U runs at a 9% higher base clock frequency (12% higher for boost frequencies). The integrated GPU has also been upgraded to HD Graphics 620. Other than that you get the same two physical cores with Hyper-Threading support for four threads, a 3MB L3 cache and the same 15-watt TDP. The processor's MSRP remains $218, although for the time being there's a $30 premium for the new Beebox-S models.

The 7200U might be clocked up to 11% faster but here we see a rather large 21% jump in performance for the L1 cache bandwidth which now exceeds that of the Core i3-6100T processor. The improvement for the L3 cache bandwidth wasn't quite as impressive, jumping up by 17%. That's still noteworthy all the same and it'll be interesting to see how these gains translate in real world applications. The Cinebench R11.5 benchmark only shows a 15% improvement for the multi-threading score which if you take that 11% clock speed advantage into account really doesn't mean much. That said, we did see a 20% improvement for the single thread test which is interesting and this jump placed the 7200U on par with the Core i3-4130 and 6100T processors. The 3DMark cloud gate score increased by 7% with the 7200U which I have to say seems to be entirely down to the fact that this new model runs at higher clock speeds and nothing else. Going back to 3DMark 06 we find the Beebox-S 7200U is 16% faster than the older 6200U model. That's a decent boost and it placed the 7200U ahead of the AMD APU powered systems as well as the Core i3-4130. This PCMark 7 result could be very telling and a strong indication of how the real-world application testing is going to go. The 7200U powered Beebox-S was just 2% faster despite that clock speed advantage, so this is a disappointing result.

The minor refresh introduces Intel’s latest processors alongside some tweaks to the overall design of the Notebook 9. Samsung has opted for a more curved chassis for its thin and light laptop, with slim bezels for the near edge-to-edge display. The tweaks mean the Notebook 9 is now closer to 2 pounds for the 15-inch model, and just 1.8 pounds for the 13-inch version. The usual ports are present, including two USB 3.0 ports and a single USB Type-C port, HDMI, and microSD slot. Samsung is no longer promising up to 12 hours battery life, with a more conservative 7-hour estimate. That’s the same amount we got during testing on the previous model earlier this year. Samsung has also added a backlit keyboard this time around, but we’ll have to wait for a closer look to see whether the Notebook 9 build quality has improved from our review back in May.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Intel's Joule 550x board can be used to make robots, drones, electronics, and VR headsets. Credit: Newegg More like this This Intel board computer can be a powerful Ubuntu 16.04 Linux PC Intel's Joule board to support Windows 10 IoT Core The Orange Pi Zero single-board computer ships for $6.99 Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Intel is shipping a new single-board computer, the Joule 550x, that will challenge the dominance of the Raspberry Pi. The board was announced in August but didn't ship right away. The Joule 550x is a full-fledged computer on a small circuit board, and it packs more horsepower and graphics capabilities than the Raspberry Pi 3. Intel's recommended price for the Joule 550x is $149 to $159, and online retailer Mouser is selling it for $179, a sizable markup. At prices of up to $349, the Joule 550x development kit, with extra components, is more than double the price of Microsoft and Seeed Studio's Raspberry Pi 3 starter kit called Seeed IoT Grove Kit for Windows, which sells for $149 and includes a 5-inch LCD screen. The kit is now available from online retailer Mouser and from Newegg for $291.  The Joule 550x will provide ample computing power to people building powerful robots, drones or electronics. Using boards available before the retail release, some Joule-based robots and devices, like Microsoft's voice recognizing Bamboo robot, have already been made, and others like bartending robots are on the way. The board also has the computing power to be used as a Linux PC, and it has integrated graphics, memory, storage and Wi-Fi on board. A virtual reality headset can also be built with the Joule 550x. The Joule 550x is a watered down version of Intel's Joule 570x board, which has a faster processor and more memory. The Intel board beats Raspberry Pi 3 on features. The Joule 550x has a quad-core Atom T5500 processor based on the Broxton chip architecture, 8GB of storage, 3GB of LPDDR4 memory, two USB 3.0 ports, dual-antenna 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It also has the usual interfaces like I2S, GPIO, and UART found on popular development boards. The computer can be used to make IoT devices and supports major operating systems like embedded Linux and Windows 10 IoT Core. Raspberry Pi 3 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410c also support major OSes. While consumer-focused robots are trendy, Intel hopes the usage of Joule expands in the enterprise. Powerful graphics capabilities are needed for tasks like product inspection. The processing capabilities of such a board could also automate engineering tasks. Intel ultimately hopes to increase shipments of IoT chips after abandoning Atom chips in the mobile and tablet markets.

The CEO resigned in February, layoffs followed in the next month, and the cloud of a takeover hung over the company with rumored negotiations to purchase the company. The company is best known as a provider of PowerVR GPUs for Apple's iPhone and the MIPS CPU architecture, which competes with Intel's X86 and ARM. Imagination has its eyes set on a strong 2017 by taking an approach much like Intel did last year and refocusing on areas of growth, which include graphics and the internet of things. Imagination next year will release new PowerVR and MIPS chip designs, with the goal of driving growth in those areas. Imagination is following the path set by chip companies ARM and Intel, which have refocused their business around IoT. The chip designer has seen success in areas like set-top boxes, automotive tech, and networking, and it will continue to focus on those areas. But Imagination has the assets to succeed in emerging areas like virtual reality, and its technologies are already being used in VR headsets. Chip design business model Imagination has a business model similar to ARM's: It designs chips and licenses the designs to companies. Next year, Imagination will release the new Series8XT graphics processor, which will be targeted at a range of devices, including high-end phones and VR headsets. Apple, which is a minority shareholder in Imagination, could be one company licensing the Series8XT GPU. Apple tweaked the previous Series7XT used in the iPhone 7 and has used PowerVR technology in all iPhones to date. Imagination also wants to regain share in the mobile market as it expands the Series8XE graphics processor into low-end and mid-range phones, said Graham Deacon, senior director of business operations for PowerVR. That's a market Imagination has lost, with competitive GPUs from ARM and Qualcomm taking share. Imagination introduced Series8XE earlier this year, and the technology is reaching low- and mid-range devices. The goal is for Series8XT to be a harbinger of many new technologies, but all the GPUs will cram in more performance, Deacon said. New opportunities The PowerVR GPUs could find a place in infotainment systems and autonomous cars. There's a fair amount of research being done to tweak the GPUs for machine learning, Deacon said. There's also an opportunity in artificial intelligence, and Imagination is developing technologies and algorithms to tap into artificial intelligence uses, Deacon said. Imagination also plans to release new MIPS CPUs in the next year. MIPS CPUs have lost market share to ARM and Intel in the IoT market, but interest remains in the CPU architecture for cars, data centers, networking, and IoT devices. The company's strategy is to go after the massive volume opportunity in IoT and networking, rather than go after mobile application processors, said Steve Evans, vice president for business operations at MIPS. ARM has dominated the mobile device market in recent years. Intel recently quit making mobile CPUs, and MIPS hasn't found success. Only a handful of mobile handsets and tablets have used MIPS CPUs. But MIPS survives in other markets. Mobileye, which develops autonomous driving systems for cars, already uses MIPS CPUs. There are also many IoT devices, like low-speed LTE modems from Sequans and Altair, using MIPS CPUs. The company is also pitching the MIPS CPU for robots, drones, and other industrial applications. MIPS CPUs are also being used in wearables, particularly products developed in China. Imagination has targeted the MIPS CPU at servers in the past but with little success. But the fastest I6500-class CPU is comparable to the top-line ARM processor and is doing well, Evans said. While main CPUs in servers may be based on x86, there's interest for MIPS CPUs in the data-plane element, and companies like Broadcom and Cavium are making networking processors based on MIPS. Drones and robots Combining PowerVR and MIPS could provide a powerful chip combination for drones and robots. MIPS can provide the multi-core processing power, while PowerVR will provide the visual computing element, Imagination executives said. As the company looks to diversify into new markets, the cloud of getting acquired will hang over their head. But it's a public company with multiple shareholders, and it will continue focusing on what it does and won't be distracted, said David Harold, a company spokesman.

At WinHEC, though, Microsoft detailed a range of features for the HMDs themselves. Note that all of these mainstream-level HMDs will be made by Intel’s and Microsoft’s hardware partners--for now, the usual PC suspects such as Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Further, the headsets we’re talking about here will be tethered and will require a PC. (For the most part.) The Headsets: A Range Of Specifications This one slide spells it out rather succinctly: On the lowest end of the spectrum, the new HMDs will offer 1200x1080 resolution per eye. That’s striking, because that’s the same per-eye resolution of the two titans of the industry, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. On the high end, Microsoft expects its hardware partners to offer up to 1440x1440, which would outpace the Rift and Vive. However, note that a major difference is that these mainstream HMDs will offer just a 60Hz refresh rate at that resolution (versus 90Hz for Rift and Vive), which could prove problematic for the user experience. Again, however, at the high end, these new HMDs should meet or exceed that refresh rate. HMD HTC Vive Oculus Rift Mainstream HMD (Low End) Mainstream HMD (High End) Display Type Dual low-persistence Samsung AMOLED Dual low-persistence Samsung AMOLED LCD OLED Resolution 1200x1080 per eye 1200x1080 per eye 1200x1080 per eye 1440x1440 per eye Refresh Rate 90Hz 90Hz 60HZ 90Hz or 120Hz Audio Microphone, jack for external headphones Microphone, integrated supra-aural 3D spatial audio headphones (removable) Audio out jack (for headphones), Mic-in jack Integrated headphones, integrated mic array Ports HDMI 1.4, USB 3.0 x 2 Proprietary headset connector (HDMI/USB 3.0) HDMI 1.4, USB 2.0 HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort, USB 3.0 Cable 5m (plus 1m from Link Box to PC) 4m Multiple cables Bonded single cable Accessories Wand controllers Touch controllers (optional, sold separately) Game controller 3DoF or 6DoF controller Price $800 $600 ($800 w/Touch controllers) Starts at $300 Unknown Curiously, Microsoft made no mention of the types of lenses we could expect, but lower-end panels will be LCD displays; you won’t get the same OLED display as the Rift and Vive unless you slide to the high end. Another important note is that the lower-end mainstream HMDs will be equipped with only a game controller. Until recently, when it finally debuted its (excellent) Touch controllers, that was one of the Rift’s primary weaknesses as a system, especially compared to the Vive. Again, though, higher-end HMDs will offer a 3DoF or 6DoF controller. Microsoft did not spell out what exactly that means, though; after all, Daydream’s controller is capable of just 3DoF, which, though better than a game controller, pales in comparison to 6DoF. Further, there’s going to be a huge difference between a 6DoF controller that an OEM whips up in a few months and the years-in-the-making Touch controllers and Vive wands. In any case, based on the presentation, we’re confident that any controllers paired with these mainstream HMDs will be tracked. For audio, expect the higher-end HMDs to sport a mic array (which Microsoft “strongly” recommends) and integrated headphones. (The HoloLens has such headphones, and although some people have criticized them for being too quiet, they do produce impressive spatial sound without requiring any actual ear cups.) This is one point where Microsoft seems to think cost will be an issue. The above is certainly ideal, but should be pricey, yet the lower-end options--an audio jack for separate headphones and what would amount to a basic boom mic--will present design problems. Also note that the range of options listed in the Microsoft slide, connectivity is not wireless; there will be HMDs with multiple-cable setups and single-cable implementations, but all will be tethered. Again, the Rift and Vive are no different in that regard. Curiously, there is no mention at all of field of view. Further, they will of course be equipped with sensors, but Microsoft did not mention anything specifics beyond calling them “IMUs” (inertial measurement units). Let’s Talk About Input Methods Although we touched on input methods above, Microsoft broke out that topic and elaborated on it a bit. The company has conceptualized multiple “interaction models” and tied those to various actions and devices. Hey look, another handy slide: It’s important to bear in mind at this juncture that Microsoft and Intel have in mind that all of these HMDs of varying feature sets will be used to do all sorts of different computing tasks, from casual computing (such as web browsing) to communications (Skype) to serious productivity (Excel and PowerPoint floating in front of you) to passive entertainment (watching movies) to active entertainment (such as gaming). Simply put, they believe that this mixed reality business is the future of personal computing, and that people will use the HMDs for everything. Therefore, it follows that there will be a variety of input methods and devices. Microsoft was clear: You can’t have too much input diversity. Even so, you have to be sure that all of those input methods are standardized and consistent for all developers and users, which is why Microsoft has spent so much time nailing these down. Note also that this platform offers seamless input switching, which is to say that you should be able to alternate freely between all forms of input easily without doing a thing. Arguably the most basic, intuitive input method is gaze. You’ll find gaze selection even in lower-end mobile VR, although there are certainly higher- and lower-tech ways to implement it. You should be able to use gaze to zip through menus, navigate, select, and so on, and Microsoft has it pegged to game pad controllers. As we’ve seen with the Rift and Vive, the next logical evolution of VR input involves motion-tracked controllers. These can bring your hands (or rather, a facsimile of your hands) into the VR environment, and with the addition of touch pads, joysticks, and buttons on those controllers, you get all sorts of marvelous capabilities. (Cast a spell, stab some zombies, shoot robots, etc.) "Non-spatial pointing" is a fancy way of saying "mouse and keyboard." This one is tricky. It’s true that for mouse input, if you’re inside an occluded HMD, you’ll have no problems. Few people actually look down at their mice when they’re using them. However, keyboard input will almost certainly prove to be more problematic; you need to see your keyboard. Microsoft can get around that in a couple of different ways; one of those is by using a camera and inside-out tracking (which we’ll discuss further down the page). Speech, though, according to Microsoft, is “the most native way to communicate to interact with the virtual world.” The company has an internal mantra that goes: “If you can see it, you can say it.” For example, if you see an item that you want to select, you should just be able to select it by saying “select.” (This will require gaze, too, you’ll note.) Inside-Out Tracking: The Linchpin All other features being more or less equal, the degrees of freedom your HMD offers is of enormous importance. Cheaper VR, like Google Daydream and even the Samsung Gear VR, offer only 3DoF. That means you can look around on X, Y, and Z axes, but you can’t move around in the virtual space or look at things from different angles. To do that, you need 6DoF, and these new mainstream HMDs will all offer it. Microsoft believes in 6DoF; it considers the tracking a major part of the user experience, and it knows that if you offer a substandard UX, people generally will dump your product. Specifically, in VR, they will vomit first and then dump your product. Thus was significant emphasis put on inside-out, 6DoF tracking on these HMDs. That inside-out tracking bit is also of enormous import; you can achieve 6DoF tracking by way of external sensors or cameras (hey there, Rift and Vive) or by placing fiducial markers all around a space, but both have limitations. In the case of the former, if you move your head too far one way or another, the HMD loses tracking with the cameras/sensors. (This is why Oculus requires a third Constellation tracker to enable room-scale VR on the Rift.) With markers, if you move to a new room, you have to fill it with new markers; obviously, this limits where you can enjoy your VR experiences. But with inside-out tracking, the HMD is equipped with technology that scans and “understands” the world as you move about in it. As we’ve said in the past, that's not just room scale tracking; it’s world scale.    This is what Microsoft is offering to its partners. And it requires no setup on the part of the user. For these HMDs, inside-out tracking requires two components: a camera and an IMU. The camera is just a camera; it’s aimed out at the world from the HMD, and it “observes” (Microsoft’s term) the world. (Of note, Microsoft uses the same SLAM Scan technology as Dacuda for this part of the process. It continuously maps your environment even as it tracks your position within it.) The IMU tracks the position of your head. The camera’s frame data and IMU data are combined and fed to the Windows platform with sensor fusion. From that you get the pose data, which is fed to the application, and it’s rendered on the display. (For this very last part, Microsoft said that it has “optimizations on the rendering part as well” that allegedly smoothes the resulting image that your eyes see.) An Untethered Future? For all the talk of inside-out tracking, though, Microsoft strangely did not list any of that hardware in its range of HMD specifications. That seems odd, doesn’t it? Further, although inside-tracking is clearly a big deal for Microsoft here, we noticed that one of the early slides in the presentation, which had a mock-up of a possible standard VR setup, showed a standalone tracker: However, in the presentation, Microsoft made no mention of any standalone tracking. Clearly, the company is focused on inside-out tracking, instead. In addition to the above discussion on inside-out tracking, another slide in the presentation stated: “Our vision: inside-out tracking for everyone.” Granted, having inside-out tracking on an HMD does not necessarily mean that it would be untethered--and indeed, it may be superior to a standalone outside-in tracker even for tethered headsets--but you certainly can’t get untethered, world-scale XR without inside-out tracking. On that point, again, Microsoft is clear. In the slide above, note that part of that “inside-out tracking for everyone” ethos is “world scale” tracking. That means not just untethered HMDs, but truly mobile ones. So why are all these HMDs tethered? It’s likely because Microsoft and Intel are still experimenting to see what will work and what consumers will want in the XR market. Tethered VR and MR experiences could certainly be part of that (they should certainly cost less than completely untethered HMDs). For that matter, the XR market could end up following same paradigm we see in the PC market: PC-tethered HMDs are like desktop PCs--not portable, but powerful--whereas untethered, mobile HMDs will be like laptops--eminently portable, indispensable to many, and typically less powerful than their desktop-bound counterparts. In any case, we continue to learn more about what Microsoft and Intel are trying to accomplish in the XR world. Now, we finally have some insight into some of the HMD hardware we can expect from PC makers. We should see some of these devices realized at CES 2017 next month.

Anonymous said: this may actually be bad if not executed correctly. cheap entry may sell units, but a substandard experience will not help the industry grow. experience on VR cannot be compromised Maybe, but given the current VR headset's markups, there's a lot of room for companies to reduce the cost of their HMDs without cutting into the quality of the product. And sure, I imagine there will be some headsets that aren't particularly good, but we already have those in the mobile VR space, in which pretty much all headsets fall into the "budget" category, and provide substandard experiences. Chances are, most "mainstream" headsets will be better than those. And of course, these upcoming headsets have an advantage in that they can look at people's experiences with the first-generation of consumer headsets from HTC, Oculus, and Sony, and build upon what works, and what doesn't with those products. For example, you'll notice that a couple of the pictured headsets feature PSVR-style headbands, which could easily help to better distribute their weight off the wearer's face, potentially making them more comfortable than the Rift or Vive. Even the existing headsets don't offer an "ideal" VR experience, and make compromises in various ways. If anything, more competition should push the existing headset manufacturers to improve their headsets and potentially reduce their prices. Quote: PC-tethered HMDs are like desktop PCs--not portable, but powerful--whereas untethered, mobile HMDs will be like laptops--eminently portable, indispensable to many, and typically less powerful than their desktop-bound counterparts. I'd say comparing untethered HMDs to tablets and smartphones would be more accurate, since some high-end gaming laptops can be similar in power to upper-mid-range desktops. And of course, many of those are even "VR capable", especially if we go by the lower Windows 10 VR requirements, so you technically could tether a headset to a laptop to maintain a reasonable degree of both portability and power. If you're packing all the computational components into the headset itself, you're going to be much more limited in terms of processing power. And of course, being "tethered" to an external machine won't necessarily mean you'll always be attached with a wire. Wireless, low-latency transmission is bound to start appearing in some headsets within the next couple years or so, even if its not ready quite yet. And there could certainly be overlap between tethered and untethered HMDs, with standalone devices offering the option to link them to an external PC or console to enable higher-detailed experiences. 1 Morfaine Dec 19, 2016, 5:21 AM You can't do good hand motion control without external tracking. If MS aren't investing in external tracking then motion control will be at best 3DOF. 0 TonyVT Dec 19, 2016, 9:36 AM I think that MS wants to keep prices low... big problem for adoption of VR is high prices... and with this non-great headset, they'll obtain that adoption 0 jaber2 Dec 19, 2016, 11:09 AM Its like Apple and Samsung are the main players and all others are trying to get theirs into the mix, if you want the real thing you've got to go with those two, meaning Oculus Rift and HTC Vive 0 bit_user Dec 19, 2016, 11:53 AM So, are you guys ever going to do an OSVR HDK2 review? 0 c4s2k3 Dec 19, 2016, 12:27 PM I like gaming and I'm really not excited about any of them. I expect I won't until there is compelling content. By 'compelling' I mean content that would make me want to spend the $$ on the hardware. It's simply not there yet and I'm not sure it will ever be. Aside from the obvious in-game locomotion issue no one has truly cracked yet, I don't see VR as a viable use case for a wide range of game genres. I like racing games and this is a pretty good fit for that (or any type of immersive vehicle sim) but in my opinion, gaming use cases fall off dramatically if you stray from that. There is potential for other applications outside of pure games for entertainment, for example I could see VR combined with better hand-tracking (much like some are doing by adding Leap sensor) used to drive a procedural trainer or something like that, but this seems like a very small niche. 0 brian532 Dec 19, 2016, 1:24 PM Microsoft was clear: You can’t have too much input diversity. Even so, you have to be sure that all of those input methods are standardized and consistent for all developers and users, which is why Microsoft has spent so much time nailing these down. Of course there can be too much input diversity. That is why microsoft came up with direct X in the first place. Why should all the VR leaders have to comply with a MS spec? The last thing we need is 3 different hardware manufactures all requiring a different software implementation to run them. which is why Microsoft has spent so much time nailing these down. This is nice of microsoft to self appoint themselves the standards maker. Why not just comply with the standard valve has produced? I guess MS is so big they can just take over and make the leaders adopt their standards. 0 Sakkura Dec 19, 2016, 9:30 PM Anonymous said: Quote: Mainstream VR HMDs Are Coming Remember when the Oculus Rift was intended to be "mainstream", back before Facebook bought them out and doubled the price of everything?

That's complete and utter nonsense. Facebook has since decided to spend another 500 million dollars on content. Just take a look at how much software they've been including with first the Rift and then the Touch - even if they were making a profit on the hardware, the included stuff more than swallows that. No, Facebook very clearly are not in this for short-term profit. What made the price go up was that they decided to go for a higher quality device. Whether that was due to the competition from the HTC Vive or their own belief that the baseline required for acceptable VR was higher than originally anticipated, I don't know. But the hardware on offer is legitimately expensive. The margins are definitely far slimmer than on similarly priced phones. 0 memadmax Dec 20, 2016, 7:20 AM Yea, I'm gonna let these companies duke it out for a bit before buying like 5 sets(for the whole family)...

Whether that was due to the competition from the HTC Vive or their own belief that the baseline required for acceptable VR was higher than originally anticipated, I don't know. But the hardware on offer is legitimately expensive. The margins are definitely far slimmer than on similarly priced phones. Oculus obviously has a huge markup on their hardware, as does HTC with the Vive, though at least in that case they weren't previously making claims otherwise. Sure, maybe they threw in a gamepad that no-one buying a VR headset actually needed, along with a couple games most purchasers of the headset probably wouldn't have otherwise bought, but those were little more than cheap additions to attempt to justify the inflated cost, and were undoubtedly licensed in bulk at a low cost to them. I highly doubt that the manufacture of the product itself, even including the unnecessary pack-in items, costs them more than around $400 per unit to produce. Likewise, the Touch controllers they just released in no way cost them anywhere remotely close to $200 to manufacture, and could have easily been sold for closer to $100. And sure, maybe the product does offer a somewhat higher level of quality than originally planned, but Sony's PSVR headset also offers a high level of quality, and it's possible to pick up a complete PSVR system, including the headset, camera, motion controllers, and even the PS4 console to run it on for less than an Oculus Rift with Touch controllers. You can't tell me an Oculus Rift setup costs more to manufacture than a complete PSVR setup and a Playstation 4 combined. Yes, Move controllers are a bit outdated at this point compared to the Rift or Vive controllers, but that clearly doesn't account for a $300+ difference. And the PSVR has been generally agreed to be the most comfortable and easily adjustable of the current consumer headsets. Of course, it's not available for use with PCs for now, but that's not stopping any of these other upcoming headsets from offering a PC-compatible VR package of comparable quality at a similar price. Facebook's planned investment in VR content does not necessarily equate to content exclusively for the Rift either. The vast majority of that content will undoubtedly be made available for other headsets, consoles, and mobile VR as well. They understand that there's money to be made in VR, whether its on their headset or others, and their investment in VR content does not necessarily depend on the long-term success of the Oculus Rift. And that's not to say Oculus will fail, just that their headset will soon be one of many, and they're trying to cash in on early-adopters while they still can, before competition forces them to price their hardware at lower margins closer to what the hardware is actually worth. I wouldn't mind the Oculus Rift's pricing quite as much if they hadn't previously convinced most that their headset would be priced somewhere below $400, without giving any suggestion that it would cost more until shortly before the official pricing was announced. When a lot of people were displeased at them for selling out to Facebook, Lackey claimed it would allow for a lower price and a timely release without product shortages, none of which turned out to be true. The Oculus Rift came out at least a year or more later than most expected, hundreds of dollars more expensive than most expected, and without the manufacturing capacity to get the units out to people in a timely manner. And of course, it's still all tied to one of the world's largest advertising companies, who will no doubt be looking for ways to track and monetize everyone's VR experiences in the coming years. Plus, this is all first-gen hardware in a relatively new field (as far as consumer devices go), that will likely become more or less obsolete within a few years. $800 can be a bit hard to swallow when it's clear that devices featuring higher resolution, eye-tracking with foveated rendering, hand/body tracking, better comfort, and wireless connectivity are likely to start appearing within the next couple years. And really, there still isn't even that great of a selection of software for the devices yet. Most VR games released so far amount to little more than tech-demos or budget mini-games, with the occasional bigger title getting some amount of VR support tacked on. I'm sure there will be a better selection of software soon enough, but there will also be a better selection of VR headsets as well. -1 Display All 19 comments Comment Firstname Submit Most Popular Dacuda Claims 3D Tracking Parity With Tango, Will Demo On Zeiss VR One Plus HMD At CES Unity Released Its Experimental EditorVR; Here's How To Use It Positional And Full-Body VR Tracking Coming With VicoVR Release Tom's Hardware Around the World Tom's Hardware Around the World Russia France Germany UK Italy USA Subscribe to Tom's Hardware Search the site Ok About Tom's Hardware Advertising About us Contact Purch Privacy Policy Terms Of Use and Sale Copyright Policy Copyright © 2017 Purch Group, Inc.

Ground truths from two powerful women. By Michael Krigsman for Beyond IT Failure | December 18, 2016 -- 00:43 GMT (16:43 PST) | Topic: CXO Image from Istockphoto In part one of my conversation with Kim Stevenson and Adriana Karaboutis, we discussed the challenges and opportunities facing women in technology Also read: Women in technology: Advice from Intel and Biogen This second post offers advice from Andi and Kim on how CIOs can add value to their organizations. Both women have years of CIO experience; Kim was CIO at Intel and Andi worked in that role at Dell. Having been in the role and then left to take on business positions, they are each highly qualified to offer advice to CIOs. Kim is currently Chief Operating Officer for the Client, IoT and System Architecture Group at Intel and Adriana is Executive Vice President Technology, Business Solutions & Corporate Affairs at Biogen. Both women are on the boards of public companies. Once a CIO, always a CIO. — Kim Stevenson, Intel Among the themes we discussed, understanding the business and being able to communicate well are primary qualifications of a modern CIO. While perhaps an obvious point, there are degrees of sophistication and subtlety regarding understanding how the business operates, why leaders make decisions, and possessing the judgment to balance trade-offs among conflicting goals and objectives. CIOs are in a unique position to understand and collaborate with the business. Unlike colleagues in other departments, IT possesses a horizontal view that goes across virtually all areas of a company. Because all departments rely on shared resources and services, such as infrastructure and security, IT typically has relationships across every part of the company. "Seat at the table" is code for understanding the business: objectives, mission, and enablers. — Adriana Karaboutis, Biogen This unique, cross-sectional view creates the opportunity for CIOs to develop a unique understanding of how all parts of the business fit together. The video embedded above offers a view inside the minds of two successful business people who held CIO positions earlier in their careers. The have fought the battles and paid their dues.

Editorial Note This article is in the Product Showcase section for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Introduction When it comes to hobbies, there seems to be no better time than now to get into Robotics. With the affordability of basic parts, wide selection of different micro-controller platforms, and a plethora of online forum support, building a working robot is within reach of anyone with even a passing interest and passion to make something come alive. This article will investigate an exciting addition to the field of robotics offered by DFRobot* at DFRobot.com. Advertised as a Robotics Mobile Tank Platform, this product is called "Devastator", and is great for basic capabilities such as moving around, and detecting objects. It also offers advanced features such as taking pictures that automatically upload to the cloud! The addition of the Intel® Edison module is a nice choice for the brains of the device, supplying the processing power required to analyze images, allow remote control via Bluetooth*, and even connect to the Internet using Wi-Fi*. Assembly of the Devastator Robot Be sure to verify and familiarize yourself with all the parts before starting, and plan on a good two-three hours to complete the project. The instructions available online are fairly straightforward, but will require some focus. Parts required are: A small Phillips head and flat head ranging from 2-4mm. An adjustable wrench or needle nose pliers. Start by downloading the Devastator instructions from https://www.dfrobot.com/ (Search for Devastator). Select the Edison Edition. As of this writing, the part number is #ROB0125. After assembly, you will gain a deeper understanding of basic robotics construction from this amateur skill level project. By the end, you’ll be familiar with assembling axles, wheels, electronics, and two different types of motors to a common tank chassis. Start with the axles, followed by attachment of the two DC motors to the track drive sprockets. Do not put the tread (links) on until it is time for the rubber to meet the road. You will want to do a few tests in the shop before taking it out for the first time. Be sure to provide the recommended one cm clearance when attaching the axles to the base. This is mentioned in the instructions. Next, construct the battery pack and motherboard to the base plate. It is important to use the plastic standoffs that are provided to prevent any solder joints from touching metal, which would cause grounding, and might permanently damage the circuitry. Ground yourself, or just use common sense and handle the motherboard with caution. Finally, connect all the circuitry and prepare for lab bench testing. Take note of the pins you have attached during the construction process. Remember that for the Romeo board, the hardware PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins are 3, 5, 6, and 9. A nice touch before finishing is to apply electrical tape around some of the open leads, like the posts on the DC motors as seen in the picture. Another recommendation is to tie the wires together, making sure there are no open wires making grounds to the board. The table below summarizes the pinout I chose for this project. PWM pins are highlighted; 3, 5, 6, and 9. PIN DIGITAL GPIO CONNECTION 2 Presence Infrared 3 Turret Base Swivel Servo Motor 4 UltraSonic Range Finder (Comp) 5 Turret Top Tilt Servo Motor 6 Buzzer 7 Left LED Light 8 Right LED Light 9 UltraSonic Range Finder (Vcc, Gnd, PWM) 10 OPEN 11 OPEN 12 OPEN 13 OPEN At this point, you can chose to continue with or without webcam and distance detection support. The top panel can be attached with four M4 bolt/nut combos, or you can continue construction of the top turret, which is also referred to as the Hexa-Base Rotate Kit. This top piece is the foundation for the base servo and allows the top turret and attached sensors (webcam and distance detector) to rotate. Construction of the hexa-pod should take less than half an hour. Constructing the top Turret (Hexa-Pod) During construction of the turret, be sure to not install the screws deep enough to touch the servo. The design of the base and top servos make this a common error. Again, get comfortable with the overall construction of the tank to ensure that you understand all the working parts. Double check the wiring is connected correctly before closing everything up. If choosing to use the top Turret, it is recommended to take advantage of the additional power input jack. Doing this will help stabilize the additional drain caused by the servos as well as the increased power burst requirements that comes from using the Wi-Fi radio. Robotics Basics Before taking the robot out for a spin, let’s review a few basics to help gain an appreciation of what is under the hood, as well as solidify a basic understanding of the electronics involved with robotics. Voltage and Current Microcontrollers and accompanying components are typically rated to work on 5.0volts or 3.3volts, and run on currents of less than 1 ampere. A voltage represents the potential amount of energy available to a device at any given time. When working with electronics, it is important to understand how voltage and current differ to avoid potentially destroying devices. While the input voltage for a microcontroller board might be listed as 9-12 volts or higher, the operational and maximum voltage ratings of each of the components that are connected to the board is much less. A step down converter on the board is used to bring voltage levels down to a safe level. Applying more voltage than a device is rated for will cause the device to burn out and be potentially destroyed. The Romeo board for the Intel® Edison module is supplied with step down voltage converter already. More information can easily be found on Wikipedia*: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_regulator_module While voltage represents the amount of potential energy, it is the current that represents the amount of electricity actually flows through a device at any given time. You may have heard the phrase "It’s not the voltage, but the current that will kill you". Voltage is by definition, only a potential of what energy is available at the source (wall or a battery for instance). Only when a circuit is formed does the actual electricity begin to flow and always at a flow rate that is controlled by a third factor called resistance. The most common medium for electrical circuits is copper wire, which has an extremely low resistance of about 8.82e-6 ohms for a one inch length of wire. As a comparison, the human skin has a resistance of 1000 Ω under the most extreme conditions (moist.) At around .01A (1 milliamp) you will be able to feel the effects of electricity, and 10mA muscle contraction can occur. Because most microcontrollers limit voltage to under 20 volts, there are no safety concerns with working with currents at these low levels. Drain All components will use (drain) as much current as required for them to operate. In the case of motors, the current requirements will increase as additional load is applied. Because of this, DC motors specifically will require an additional power supply with a higher voltage as compare with other components such as LEDs or sensors. When working with DC motors, always supply with a proper motor controller, and diode protection to avoid any back EMF induced when turning on and off the motors. More details on these topics can be found online by searching for "DC Motors" and "Back EMF." Examples of common voltage and current ranges: Device/Component DC Voltage Min/Max current Intel® Edison module 7v-15v 1A input     200mA draw (600mA during Wi-Fi bursts) Intel® Edison GPIO Pin @3.3v 1.8-3v Output 24mA Intel® Edison GPIO Pin @5v 1.8-3v Output 32mA Common LED 1.8-4v 20ma DC Brushed motor 6v-9v Depends on stall current   Actuators An actuator is something that can be controlled by the microcontroller. Some examples are motors, LEDs, and buzzers. The manner in which these components are controlled differs with each type of device. For instance, an LED can be turned on and off through a connection to a GPIO pin in combination with a current limiting resistor. Simply flowing current through the diode will cause it to emit light. The more current, the brighter the light. A motor however, is best controlled using a technique called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which toggles voltage to the motor in an on/off fashion as a very fast rate. PWM basics A DC motor is not supplied with a continuous flow of electrical current. It is powered using a technique called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which allows current to flow off and on very quickly. When using PWM, the on time of a motor is controlled using a combination of an underlying signal, which oscillates at a specific frequency, and something called the "duty cycle", which is the amount of time the signal is kept high (turned on) during oscillations of the wave. If a hardware based timer is known to provide a frequency of 1Hz (once per second), a light can be made to blink by setting the duty cycle to .5, which means that the light is on for half a second and off for the other half. Similarly the light can appear to blink slower, by leaving the signal high for a full second. The Servo Motor Similar to the DC motor, a servo motor operates the exact same way with the added ability that it can be positioned with accuracy to stop and hold in a given position. A nice introduction to Servo motors can be found here: Introduction to Servos Sensors Adding the ability to detect the presence of an object as well as how far away it is will make any robot smarter. Using standard GPIO pins, the PIR (Passive Infrared) can be used to detect a change in the electromagnetic field. Because all things emit radiation, this sensitive device has the ability to detect even small changes in light. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_infrared_sensor Another example of an excellent sensor is the ultrasonic range finder, which is a distance indicator. This sensor uses ultrasonic sound waves to determine the distance away an object is by bouncing a sound wave off of the object and detecting how long it takes to return. This is similar to the good old fashioned Radar used by police radar speed detectors, yet different because it uses sound waves instead of radio waves. This device is affordable, but only intended for short distance calculations under somewhat clean conditions, meaning no dust, dirt or snow. Tour of the Romeo board for Intel® Edison module The brains of the Devastator Robot, including the ability to move the motors, sense surroundings, and toggle lights, is provided in the Romeo development board. Packed with fourteen GPIO Pins (4 PWMs), a built in H-Bridge motor driver, SPI and I2C capabilities, dedicated connections for external power connections, and an Intel® Edison module, this platform is promising as a powerful board to power any starter mobile robotics projects. The beauty of this platform is in its expandability. Additional power and components can easily be added and mounted to the well-built chassis. For more information, visit DFRobot.com for a full schematic download of the Romeo board. Power The standard battery pack supplied with the DFRobot* Devastator kit is a 6x1.5 v AA battery pack which is 9V total source voltage. The maximum input voltage is capable of supporting up to 12V input for additional power. It is important to remember that while additional voltage can be supplied as input, the board itself will supply 3.3V on the GPIO Pins at any given time, and a separate controlled voltage for the motor controller circuit. A separate power jack labeled "Servo Power" can be attached to supply additional power for the servo control. While the entire platform will operate solely on the provided 9V (AA x 6) battery pack, you will find parallel operations such as directional DC motor movement, Servo panning, and Wi-Fi upload bursting will require just about all the 9V has to offer. The DC motor driver alone will use a constant current is 2A per motor a full source. Knowing these things in advance, it is highly recommended to invest in rechargeable batteries. A few good runs of the tank at full operation will quickly drain the rated 2,500 mAH of AA standard alkaline batteries. A nice addition would be to purchase a set of 9V rechargeable batteries, and supply a solid 18v for the input. In addition, the separate input power for the Servo jack is a nice option to source additional power to the board and offload some of the current drain from the main input. If choosing to attach the servo input, be sure to never exceed the input voltage of the servos and attached devices. Motor Control The DC motors are connected next to the power input jack, and as shown in the schematic, connect directly to an H-Bridge driver IC which performs the voltage biasing required for forward and reverse movement. While the Intel® Edison module is the main controller for the board, the motor controller IC is actually driven by an Atmel ATMega8 MCU. Separately, the servo motors are connected to the GPIO rail PWM dedicated Pins and are driven using timing signals typical with any Servo control. As mentioned in the previous section, if you chose to source additional voltage to the Servo input, be sure to not exceed the input that the Servo motors can handle. Data and Serial Connections On the opposite side of the board from the input power is the micro-USB connections. The first connection you will most likely use is the Serial connection, which is labeled COM. This port will provide the ability to connect into the Intel® Edison module and run a terminal shell session to do such things as configure the Edison, connect to Wi-Fi, and even configure and download additional software components from within the shell. It is not meant for data transfer.The second connection is the USB/OTG connection, which is the primary connection used when uploading Arduino* style sketches to the board. A tip is to leave the cables connected and remove from your computer when testing on the workbench. As with any physical connection, too much plugging and unplugging increases risks wearing out the input ports. You will find during the initial steps of testing that there will be a lot of connecting and disconnecting, so better to do on the ‘A’ connection to your PC instead of the micro side on the board. One additional connection that is worth mentioning at this time is the FTDI connection. You will be required to update the ATMega8 Firmware on your board to address a known issue related to I2C stability. This update is necessary to ensure your DC motors run properly, and will be covered in the following section. Firmware Coding To make things actually work, you must create software and upload to the Intel® Edison module. There are a few different ways this can be accomplished. First, because Intel® Edison module runs a Linux* operating system (Yocto Linux), one way is to simply write a C, C++, or Python* program and execute directly in the OS in the same manner as any other application that runs in any Linux OS. There are many libraries already available in the community to access all of the hardware on the Intel® Edison module. From simple GPIO pin access to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, there are freely available libraries you can install and code against. You can simply create the program, and perform a standard make process to create the executable. A second way to program the Edison, and also the method described in this article, is using the well-known Arduino* libraries and IDE. Programming using Arduino is simple, and is accomplished on the Intel® Edison module using the CLLoader Arduino emulator which runs as a service in the Linux OS. This service is set to run by default on the Intel® Edison module, so no additional work is required to upload and run Arduino sketches. Simply connect your board and upload sketches just like any other Arduino compatible MCU platform. You can verify that the clloader process is running using a simple ps command in the Linux shell. To get started programming using Arduino, download the latest Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software Finally, the latest Intel XDK® offers the ability to upload sketches over Wi-Fi. The development language used by the XDK is Node JavaScript* (Node.JS*), and is growing constantly in the libraries and wrappers available. Applications are compiled and uploaded to a daemon process running directly on the Intel® Edison modulein a similar manner as the Arduino sketches, yet through a different service. Setup Before any peripheral testing, a good start is to ensure all of the firmware is up to date and drivers are installed. Connect the COM Port (Not the OTG port), and ensure it is visible and correct baud rates on the Serial COM Port by executing ‘Device Manager’ on Windows* and navigating to Ports. The connection is the default Serial connection and can be used to remote into the device and run a Linux shell session. Next, connect the Data OTG connection. This connection is how sketches and code is updated to the Intel® Edison module. Download Intel® Edison module Related Software Drivers and Setup https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads Firmware Flashtool https://software.intel.com/en-us/using-flash-tool-lite Finally, download the latest Poky image and run the flashtool to update the Intel® Edison module with the latest Linux image. https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads Update ATMega8* MCU via FTDI connection This update is required to ensure your ATMega8 is fully up to date and specifically to ensure an I2C defect is fixed that was causing issues turning the motors! https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Romeo_for_Edison_Controller_SKU:_DFR0350#Atmega8_Firmware_Upgrade Configure Intel® Edison module Using PuTTY, connect using same serial settings identified on the port, and ssh as ‘root’ with no password. Be sure to hit enter to complete the connection. Download PuTTY from here: http://www.putty.org/ Run 'configure-edison -setup', and follow the prompts to complete the setup. You can optionally connect to Wi-Fi if it is available. Update the Intel® Edison module to allow sketches to load on boot The current distribution of the Poky image does not set the loader permissions correctly for the default script loader. This process is mandatory to ensure that the last image uploaded is executed on the next startup of the device. There are four files that need to be uploaded. Download the updated files https://github.com/gameswarp/edison-clloader Make a backup of your current files, and then transfer the downloaded files using WinSCP to /opt/edison folder. Download WinSCP: https://winscp.net/eng/download.php After the files are uploaded, select the new files and hit F9 to change the four files to executable. You can verify that the newly uploaded script is different by running the diff command, or simply manually verifying the changes. More details on this process can be found here: https://communities.intel.com/thread/77945 Importing Arduino* Libraries Arduino basics include the ability to connect and recognize the device, ensure the correct board drivers and libraries are installed, and any common library support is downloaded as well as installed in the correct location. Adding Library support is as simple as finding the code and copying the folder and files under your Arduino\library folder. The Arduino IDE also has an "Import As Zip" option, however sometimes this process does not work if the library supplier has not followed all of the correct processes and structure. The bottom line is adding libraries to Arduino is as simple as having the folder under the libraries folder. You will find also that most libraries come with an examples subfolder, which will nicely show up in your examples drop down under the Arduino IDE upon the next launch. For more information, you can reference the following link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries Setup Arduino IDE STEP 1: Ensure Arduino IDE is setup with Intel® Edison modulen i686 Board Support. This should already be available after installing the latest Arduino and following the Intel® Edison module setup installers. Ensure Intel® Edison module i696 Board Support is installed: [Tools--►Boards--►Board Manager] STEP 2: Install the DFRobot Library https://github.com/ouki-wang/Devastator-Tank-Mobile-Platform-with-Edison Copy the DevastatorEdison folder to your Arduino Library folder [SKETCH--►Include Library--►Manage Libraries]. Search for DFRobot, and click Install button. STEP 3: Run a quick test To verify the DFRobot library support is available, create a quick sketch and reference the classes provided by the library. If the following code compiles, you are ready to start the pre-launch testing of the device. If the code does not compile, try restarting the Arduino IDE or manually verifying that the library is installed correctly. #include <DFRobot.h>
#include <IIC1.h>

void setup() {}
void loop() {} Pre-Launch Testing Before releasing the Devastator robot for testing, it is recommended to code a basic set of bare bones tests to ensure the functionality is correct. Performing this up front stabilization effort will allow you to identify defects early, and result in a quicker turnaround time for future feature development. Basic Tests Control the motor – Forward, Reverse, Left, and Right Turns Turn lights on Sound Buzzer Object detection Overall, be sure to take testing slow and never run the motors at full speed or angles until you have validated a smaller range of operation. For this project, a good set of test cases would include ensuring that each of the components are operational. It is very helpful to add Serial.print() commands to output expected behavior to the console for logging. Again, doing all this up front will raise your confidence before taking it out into the environment. One of the boxes provided in the DFRobot kit (The Electric Parts Accessories Box) serves as a nice base with plenty of wheel clearance for the DFRobot pre-launch testing with and without the track attached.

} Hit the Road Now that some basic tests have passed, your robot is ready to complete construction. Before starting this final step, it is recommended to upload an empty sketch or a simple light blink test to avoid any previous motor code from executing when you turn the tank on. Turn off the battery, and then attach the tracks to the sprockets on each side of the tank carefully. Flash one of the test movement sketches from the previous section, disconnect the USB, and set your tank on the ground. Turn the battery switch on to begin execution of the sketch! Here is a very basic sketch that will kick start your exploration. I recommend to always execute a motorOff() call before reversing directions, and encourage you to modify the code and have fun.

} Advanced Maneuvers Now that the robot is moving around, you can get more creative by enhancing code in your Arduino code base, or branch out to some of the different development options mentioned in the previous section. One development option is to dig into the mraa (pronounced "m-rah") Linux libraries directly through C development or by using JavaScript wrappers in the Intel XDK®. By moving to the Intel XDK®, you will be able to program the device wirelessly,which is a very nice feature that will remove the need to be connected to the device for classic Arduino sketch uploads.

The board was announced in August but didn't ship right away. The Joule 550x is a full-fledged computer on a small circuit board, and it packs more horsepower and graphics capabilities than the Raspberry Pi 3. But at prices of up to US$349, the Joule 550x costs about 10 times more than Raspberry Pi 3. The board is now available from online retailer Mouser. It is available for $291 on Newegg. Intel's recommended price for Joule 550x is $149 to $159, so Mouser is asking for a heavy premium for the computer board. The Joule 550x will provide ample computing power to people building powerful robots, drones, or electronics. Using boards available before the retail release, some Joule-based robots and devices, like Microsoft's voice recognizing Bamboo robot, have already been made, and others like bartending robots are on the way. The board also has the computing power to be used as a Linux PC, and it has integrated graphics, memory, storage and Wi-Fi on board. A virtual reality headset can also be built with the Joule 550x. The Joule 550x is a watered down version of Intel's Joule 570x board, which has a faster processor and more memory. The Intel board beats Raspberry Pi 3 on features. The Joule 550x has a quad-core Atom T5500 processor based on the Broxton chip architecture, 8GB of storage, 3GB of LPDDR4 memory, two USB 3.0 ports, dual-antenna 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It also has the usual interfaces like I2S, GPIO, and UART found on popular development boards. The computer can be used to make IoT devices and supports major operating systems like embedded Linux and Windows 10 IoT Core. Raspberry Pi 3 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410c also support major OSes. While consumer-focused robots are cool, Intel hopes the usage of Joule expands in the enterprise. Powerful graphics capabilities are needed for tasks like product inspection. The processing capabilities of such a board could also to automate engineering tasks. Intel ultimately hopes to increase shipments of IoT chips after abandoning Atom chips in the mobile and tablet markets.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 17, 2016 at 5:31PM Image source: Getty Images. Looking at Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) chart this year, it's hard to imagine anything could be wrong with the memory-chip specialist. Micron's stock has risen more than 40% so far in 2016, easily outpacing the Nasdaq's 8% return. However, since the end of the dot-com bubble sell-off around the start of 2003, a far more important long-term pattern has emerged that anyone considering investing in Micron ought to consider: MU data by YCharts. While more diversified semiconductor producers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have also underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Micron shares have performed slightly worse than Intel while also proving far more volatile in the process. This boom-and-bust tendency in Micron stock makes it highly unappealing from a long-term investor's perspective. So here are two other semiconductor names investors could do well to consider in lieu of Micron. 1. Intel Though they share a common industry, Intel's and Micron's respective places within the semiconductor market give them little else in common. Intel dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, the chips that serve as the "brains" for PCs and servers. In these markets, speed matters, and Intel's ability to consistently produce the fastest chips has allowed it to command premium prices for its chips. Over time, Intel's cushy margin structure allowed it to reinvest heavily in research-and-development and manufacturing innovations, thus extending its chips' competitive position. This self-reinforcing cycle has lead Intel to enjoy what many view as a moderate competitive advantage over rivals like Advanced Micro Devices. The difference in quality between Intel's and Micron's segments of the semiconductor market truly shines through when you compare their respective margin structures. For example, Intel's two core operating segments are each larger, more profitable, and more stable than Micron's entire revenue base, which relies almost exclusively on commodity-like memory chips. Moreover, Micron, which recently released its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings, generated $12.4 billion in sales this fiscal year. And though Intel will not release its FY 2016 report until early next year, Intel's 2015 operating profits topped $14 billion, more than Micron's entire sales this fiscal year. For this article's purposes, Intel's chief virtue is its lack of exposure to the low-margin memory-chip business. 2. Samsung Unlike Intel, Korean conglomerate Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) competes head-to-head against Micron in the memory-chip market to a meaningful degree. However, Samsung holds an advantage over Micron in that its memory business serves as a single piece of its many business segments, one that nicely complements its consumer-electronics businesses. Samsung's phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices require memory chips in order to store the code on which their software runs. Manufacturing its own memory, via its Samsung Foundry business, allows Samsung to reduce its reliance on third-party memory suppliers like Micron, while also lowering its component costs. Samsung's memory business is not just a profit center for the company, but also serves its overall strategy by allowing it to more effectively produce its electronics. Equally important, Samsung likely remains the market's largest memory-chip maker; Samsung not only builds its own chips, but also makes chips for third-party tech companies like. Especially in industries where the market sets prices, being the largest provider can provide some benefits over the competition. In that vein, Samsung's $29 billion in memory-chip sales in fiscal year 2015 more than doubled Micron's total sales this year. What's more, Samsung's massive Foundry business gives it the ability to more effectively compete for market share against stand-alone operators like Micron. However, I prefer Samsung (like Intel) over Micron for its diversification away from the memory-chip market, not its strong competitive stance within it. Foolish bottom line Each of the companies presented here was selected because it faces less exposure to the memory-chip business than Micron. As evidenced by Micron's performance this year, investors can profit immensely by investing in Micron under the right conditions. As in any commodity-esque business, though, times of weak pricing can cause wrenching losses for companies like Micron, which relies on memory-chip sales as its sole source of revenue. To be sure, Micron has done a nice job consolidating market share, which could help give it the ability to compete throughout the memory-chip price cycle. However, for long-term investors, plenty of other stocks in the semiconductor market offer less risk and more growth than Micron does today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 18, 2016December 18, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Ignore Micron Technology, Inc.: Here Are 2 Better Stocks Image source: Getty Images. Looking at Micron Technology ‘s(NASDAQ: MU) chart this year, it’s hard to imagine anything could be wrong with the memory-chip specialist. Micron’s stock has risen more than 40% so far in 2016, easily outpacing the Nasdaq ‘s 8% return. However, since the end of the dot-com bubble sell-off around the start of 2003, a far more important long-term pattern has emerged that anyone considering investing in Micron ought to consider: MU data by YCharts . While more diversified semiconductor producers like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have also underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Micron shares have performed slightly worse than Intel while also proving far more volatile in the process. This boom-and-bust tendency in Micron stock makes it highly unappealing from a long-term investor’s perspective. So here are two other semiconductor names investors could do well to consider in lieu of Micron. 1. Intel Though they share a common industry, Intel’s and Micron’s respective places within the semiconductor market give them little else in common. Intel dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, the chips that serve as the “brains” for PCs and servers. In these markets, speed matters, and Intel’s ability to consistently produce the fastest chips has allowed it to command premium prices for its chips. Over time, Intel’s cushy margin structure allowed it to reinvest heavily in research-and-development and manufacturing innovations, thus extending its chips’ competitive position. This self-reinforcing cycle has lead Intel to enjoy what many view as a moderate competitive advantage over rivals like Advanced Micro Devices . The difference in quality between Intel’s and Micron’s segments of the semiconductor market truly shines through when you compare their respective margin structures. For example, Intel’s two core operating segments are each larger, more profitable, and more stable than Micron’s entire revenue base, which relies almost exclusively on commodity-like memory chips. Moreover, Micron, which recently released its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings, generated $12.4 billion in sales this fiscal year. And though Intel will not release its FY 2016 report until early next year, Intel’s 2015 operating profits topped $14 billion, more than Micron’s entire sales this fiscal year. For this article’s purposes, Intel’s chief virtue is its lack of exposure to the low-margin memory-chip business. 2. Samsung Unlike Intel, Korean conglomerate Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) competes head-to-head against Micron in the memory-chip market to a meaningful degree. However, Samsung holds an advantage over Micron in that its memory business serves as a single piece of its many business segments, one that nicely complements its consumer-electronics businesses. Samsung’s phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices require memory chips in order to store the code on which their software runs. Manufacturing its own memory, via its Samsung Foundry business, allows Samsung to reduce its reliance on third-party memory suppliers like Micron, while also lowering its component costs. Samsung’s memory business is not just a profit center for the company, but also serves its overall strategy by allowing it to more effectively produce its electronics.

What’s more, Samsung’s massive Foundry business gives it the ability to more effectively compete for market share against stand-alone operators like Micron.

Team Agro Hackers Takes Farming to the Next Level Now that the eight-week Intel® Ultimate Coder Challenge for IoT is complete, teams continue developing and expanding their projects into the commercial sector. Key to this progress is the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, which streamlines the path to product by providing hardware, software and tools in an easy-to-use package. Five global teams selected from over 180 submissions went head-to-head developing innovative commercial IoT solutions using Intel® IoT technology to address real-world issues. During the competition, teams posted their progress to encourage feedback from judges and other developers. In August, Team IoT Vaidya captured Grand Prize in the competition with their Cognitive Healthcare System for Rural Areas. The project enabled patients from remote areas with access to a medical diagnostic monitoring system utilizing an IoT solution which feeds data to the cloud for analysis and diagnosis. Each team overcame challenges and obstacles to complete their projects and expand on a larger scale. To learn more about the Agro Hackers and their project, you can view their video presentation from the competition. In this update, learn how Team Agro Hackers re-focused their efforts and redesigned their device to further refine their project to be an even more game changing IoT solution. Taking Farm Connect to a New Level Team Agro Hackers, led by Kalaileesha Letchumanan is taking their Farm Connect project to a new level – by now integrating their design to be used with drone technology! During the final field test they realized using a drone as a monitoring vehicle would not only speed up detection, but expand crop coverage. As a result, they are in the process of building their own drone which carries a camera and sensor modules and is powered with an IA-based Arduino 101* as the controller for the drone. Their autonomous Dragon drone will be the next generation farming tool for improved crop management. Project Methodologies Farm Connect’s focus is aimed at pest and disease monitoring and control via a digital image-based IoT solution. The Crop Disease Monitoring Unit of the solution monitors crop growth on a daily basis and can detect signs of disease. Beyond detection, the IoT solution can identify and classify the crop disease then recommend suitable solutions using machine learning techniques. In the redesign, Farm Connect captures an image from the High Definition Camera which is then input into the Crop Disease Identification and Classification Algorithm. The Crop Disease Identification and Classification Algorithm will pre-process the input image; identify the infected part, and then extract the required features. These extracted features are sent to a cloud server via a gateway. Based on a decision engine in the cloud server, the best solution for the infected crops is provided. The crop images are then stored in the cloud server for future reference. Tips Based on the Experience Team Agro Hackers created a high-level framework for agriculture applications. By following a top-down approach and sub dividing the classifications, the process provides a clear picture of the agriculture industry and helped to quickly identify key problem areas. The intent was to target the areas of disease and pest management. By creating a framework to identify the key problems, the solutions became much easier to process. and more applicable to other crop types and geographical locations. The design model standardizes IoT-based agriculture applications and creates an end to end framework which the developer community can easily apply to other agriculture stages such as Resource Management, Crop Management, and Pest/Disease Management. Key Learnings Team Agro Hackers has explored many approaches in solving agriculture issues. To address pest and disease management, they used a bot concept to explore crops and to gather data by refining their concept to be used with a drone. The approach sped up detection and expanded crop coverage. Team Agro Hackers not only addressed the issues at hand, but set up the flexibility to tackle future problems farmers may face in agricultural management.

The Microsoft Azure IoT Gateway SDK gives you a myriad of tools that allow you to enable gateway devices in multiple ways. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Introduction The Microsoft Azure* IoT Gateway SDK gives you a myriad of tools that allow you to enable gateway devices in multiple ways. It can also enable almost any device with an internet connection to become a gateway. It works for both Windows* and Linux* development environments that have the ability to compile C and C++ code. It’s also extremely modular, having a lightweight core to drive the modules you can include within it. This core handles how the modules communicate with each other, apathetic of the environment it’s in. This broker is the key to having effective modules, and an overall effective gateway. It also simplifies communicating with the Microsoft Azure* cloud service. Modules The SDK includes several modules by default, which can help you understand their structure, application, and communication. They can also provide a good testbed for a gateway, or your custom modules. To begin we will take a look at some of the modules created by Microsoft, and how they play in to the SDK as a whole. Each module is "wrapped" differently depending on whether it’s being used in a Windows or Linux development environment, but is otherwise the same. hello_world The hello_world module is designed to output a simple "hello world" message to the systems log. The majority of the code is error checking, to ensure the environment is properly setup by the core features of the SDK before executing. This module is a publisher, this means its goal is to publish messages to the broker, which can then send the message to whoever needs it. In this case it simply sends "helloWorld", "from Azure IoT Gateway SDK simple sample!" to the broker, but other modules could send sensor information, or instructions. Logger The Logger module is another simple module, which listens to the broker for any messages, before saving them to a JSON file. The logger does not output any data to the broker, but instead retains all data that has been through the broker. It appends several things to them, like the time of the event the content and the origin of the message, before appending it to the specified JSON log file. This simple module is good to use for error checking, as it can show you in real time, the series of events that lead to an unexpected output. Building Your "Gateway" The SDK has a built in function to build your gateway. Of course it doesn’t assemble the hardware through magic blue smoke. Instead it builds the object that acts as a configuration for the SDK to properly interact with modules and hardware. This function takes input in the form of a JSON file, which needs to instruct the program which modules to include, and how the broker needs to act towards them. Modules The module portion of the JSON file must include three things. Firstly, the modules name, which must be unique in your SDK. The next field that must be filled out is the path of the module. This path must end in .so or .dll, depending on the operating system your using for your gateway. Finally you must enter the arguments your module is expecting. Modules like the logger expects an argument for the file it’s meant to output to. The hello_world module expects no arguments, and therefore you pass it "null". Links This section of the JSON is used to instruct the broker on how to handle messages that are sent to it. Source modules are designated to send messages to the broker. Modules designated as sinks accept messages from the broker. In the case of the "Hello World" sample, the hello_world module is designated a source, and the logger module a sink. Below is an example of a JSON to build the gateway environment on a Linux host machine, taken from the Azure IoT Gateway SDK github. Conclusion A developer wishing to design their own module must look through the current modules provided by Microsoft. This article should have given you a good idea of the relationship between modules and the core of the SDK. Upon building your own modules, you need to take into consideration how they are going to react, and be applied in the world of the SDK, and the broker. The true power of a module lies in how it communicates to other modules to do what they need to. So go out there and design your own modules, test them out, and make your gateways act the exact way you want them to!

By Hope Reese | December 19, 2016, 8:34 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Uber released a self-driving test fleet on the streets of Pittsburgh, PA, in September 2016. Image credit: Uber It's been a major year in the driverless tech space, with the US government introducing the first-ever guidelines on autonomous vehicle development, ride-sharing giant Uber unveiling self-driving fleets to the public in Pittsburgh and San Francisco, and Tesla announcing that all new vehicles will have the hardware required for full autonomy. Beyond the announcements of any single automaker, tech company, or regulator, is a larger trend: A rush for the big players in the auto world to partner up with the tech that can help make driverless vehicles a reality. Here's a list of TechRepublic's top seven partnerships in the autonomous vehicle world. 1. General Motors invests $500 million into Lyft In January, one of the top three auto companies in the US made what the New York Times reported as the "single largest direct investment by an auto manufacturer into a ride-hailing company." The move also aimed to spur the collaboration of an on-demand fleet of driverless cars. It is likely that Lyft and GM may have some kind of announcement about the progress of this fleet in early 2017. 2. General Motors buys Cruise In a second big announcement from GM, the automaker purchased Cruise Automation, a San Francisco-based startup, for reportedly over $1 billion in March. Cruise Automation is part of GM's recently founded Autonomous Vehicle Development Team, based in San Francisco.

Some got tired of waiting and hacked together an open source hardware and software solution. This is their story. Read more 3. Fiat Chrysler announces partnership with Google In a departure for Google, which had previously been working on developing its own autonomous car, the tech giant announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler in May—its first direct collaboration with an automaker. The project, intended to develop self-driving minivans, will use sensors and computer systems from Google. 4. Mobileye, Delphi, and Intel team up to develop driverless car tech In August, two major driverless tech developers announced a groundbreaking alliance, aiming to deliver a tech package for level 4 autonomous vehicles that would be ready by 2019. Mobileye, an advanced visions system for the cars, had previously partnered with Tesla, and is now helping fuel driverless tech in GM, Nissan, VW, and other carmakers. And, in November, Intel joined the duo. Driverless car tech is likely to require huge amounts of processing power, so the team will use Intel's Core i7 chip to help vehicles scan the roads.

Ford acquired Israeli startup, Saips In August, Ford CEO Mark Fields made a major announcement: The auto giant would mass produce fully-autonomous, steering wheel-free vehicles, by 2021. To enable this development, the company purchased an Israeli company that specialized in machine learning and computer vision. As John Dolan, principal systems scientist in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, recently told TechRepublic, "a major trend is the more intensive application of machine learning to autonomous driving." 6. Volvo and Uber teamed up on autonomous vehicle platform A major alliance was announced In August, when Uber and Volvo came together in the development of driverless cars. Uber invested $300 million in the Swedish automaker, choosing Volvo as a partner because of its safety record. As we previously reported, Uber plans to release 100 self-driving Volvos on the roads of Pittsburgh, where its first driverless fleet is available to the public, by the end of 2017. 7. Uber buys Otto for over $680 million One of the first places where driverless vehicles may appear en masse is in the trucking world. In Germany, Daimler's autonomous 18-wheelers are currently using driverless tech on public roads. By purchasing Otto, a driverless trucking startup, in August, Uber signaled its intention to get in on that development.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Review: Lenovo Miix 510 2-in-1 Windows 10 PC Brittany A. Roston - Dec 19, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 7/10 Pros Excellent display Attractive, premium design Velvet-like slip cover Very sturdy hinge with ample viewing angles Cons Some flex in keyboard when typing Keyboard layout requires some adjustment Battery life is somewhat disappointing Lenovo‘s latest 2-in-1 PC is, like others before it, composed of two parts: a tablet portion and a detachable keyboard. When connected together, the sum total of parts that is the Miix 510 form a quasi-laptop; when separated, though, you have a highly portable tablet packing Windows 10. It’s the best of both worlds, but is the Miix 510 the best among 2-in-1 laptops? Read our full review to find out! Hardware Two-in-one PCs tend to exist in two varieties: the simple and cheap variety targeted at those who simply want a detachable tablet, and the more powerful feature-heavy variety targeted at professionals like graphic designers. The Lenovo Miix 510 falls into the second category, boasting everything from a very flexible watchband-based kickstand to a 12.2-inch 1920 x 1200 resolution display. One particularly notable feature is the Miix 510’s kickstand — it can be adjusted up to 170-degrees, supporting a bunch of different viewing angles, and it features the same watchband hinge we’ve seen with the Lenovo 910 and other models. The support for many viewing angles is an important part of any 2-in-1 system, earning the Miix points over other models that only support one or two angles. The tablet itself is made from a single piece of magnesium-aluminum, and features angled edges complementing rounded corners and a dark display bezel. The back of the keyboard portion has a lightly textured material akin to leather for a premium feel, and both components — tablet and keyboard — are complemented by a velvet-like loose fitting slipcover you can slip the device into for traveling. The entire presentation is very nice, one that is arguably luxurious but not so much as to be pretentious. Improving the entire package is the Lenovo Active Pen, a full-size stylus in the shape of an ordinary ink pen including a small clip. The stylus is entirely black save for a small bit of red trim at the top — it uses the same AAAA batteries that most full-size styluses use. The stylus offers 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity, making it suitable for detailed drawing and photo editing as well as ordinary writing. The stylus includes palm rejection and two buttons for controlling the tablet from the pen itself. The stylus doesn’t weigh much more than an ordinary pen at 12 grams. I tested the stylus with a few different applications, including two common ones: Windows Paint and Autodesk Sketchbook. It was very nice to use — you can make very fine lines using a light touch, and dark, thick lines using a heavy hand. The ends of the lines can be suitably tapered by adjusting pressure as you draw (depending on the application, of course). Handwriting is great as well, though it does still feel like writing on a smooth piece of glass, so you have to adjust accordingly. TECH SPECS Processor: Up to 6th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processor Operating System: Up to Windows 10 Home Graphics: Up to Intel® HD 520 Webcam / Microphone: – Front: 2 MP fixed focus – Rear: 5 MP auto focus; dual array mics Memory: Up to 8GB LPDDR4 Storage: Up to 256GB PCIe SSD Audio: Stereo speakers w/ Dolby® Audio™ Battery: Up to 8 hours with local video playback Display: 12.2” Full HD+ (1920×1200 ) Dimensions (W x D x H): – (inches) : 11.8 x 8.1 x 0.4 (tablet ) / 11.8 x 8.1 x 0.6 (with keyboard) – (mm) : 300 x 205 x 9.9 (tablet ) / 300 x 205 x 15.9 (with keyboard) Weight: Starting at 1.98 lbs (900 g) (tablet ) / 2.65 lbs (1.25 kg) (with keyboard) Keyboard Options: – 1.5 mm travel backlit keyboard w/ precision touchpad WiFi: 802.11 ac WiFi Bluetooth: Bluetooth® 4.0 Ports: – USB 3.0 Type-C – USB 3.0 Audio combo jack Colors: Platinum silver Software & Performance The Lenovo Miix 510 features Windows 10 Home 64 and Lenovo’s own myriad software, including Lenovo ID, Lenovo Always Online, Lenovo App Explorer for FPC, Lenovo CCSDK, Lenovo WRITEit, Lenovo PC Manager, and Lenovo Cloud Disk. According to Lenovo, the Miix also includes a trial of Yandex and Microsoft Office Desktop. In practical usage, performance is right up there with some notable competing models like the Dell XPS 12 and the HP Elite x2. I used the laptop during general daily work (Internet browsing, music in the background, photo editing, etc), and it never gave me any issues. The tablet is very snappy, and likewise holds its own during dedicated photo editing and drawing sessions. I could easily see the Miix 510 serving as my primary laptop. Battery life was a tad disappointing, though not terribly out of the realm of other similar 2-in-1 PCs. Lenovo says the Miix 510 offers up to 8 hours of battery life per charge, but in usage it topped out at around 6 hours for me. That’s general usage throughout my day, which includes photo editing, some downloading, and a lot of web browsing with screen brightness at 100%. No doubt you could squeeze more run time out of the laptop if you tried, but in general you’d be right in expecting to charge at least a little bit during a typical 8-hour work day. Things we like The Miix 510’s design is beautiful, there’s no doubt about that. This model feels nice in the hands, and impressive when pulled from the velvet-like slip cover. The design is better than some comparable 2-in-1 models in this price range that I’ve reviewed over the years, and while design is subjective, I quite like it. I’d place the Miix 510’s design up there with the HP Elite x2. Because this model will appeal to professionals, it’s important that usability gets a large design focus, and it does. The tablet portion features a set of volume rocker buttons, the power button, a USB-C port, USB Type-A 3.0 port, and an audio jack for headphones. That’s a nice array of ports for a device like this, and while you’ll probably still want to have a USB-C dongle on hand for video options, you won’t be entirely out of luck if you’re caught without said adapters. The real winner here is the display, a very bright and highly saturated (but not too much so) product that’ll please just about everyone: artists, photographers, graphic designs, and movie-lovers. The screen brightness can be set very high, so there’s no issue seeing it in bright environments. Coupled with the Lenovo Active Pen, you could certainly use the Miix 510 as a primary device for any number of things: designers could use it to create 3D models or digital sculptures, artists could use the combination (stylus and tablet) for drawing and digital painting. And, of course, it’s perfectly suitable for taking handwritten notes, whether it’s during a company meeting or in a mathematics class. Issues Issues come in two varieties: problematic elements and subjective elements. There’s nothing decidedly problematic with the Miix 510, and that’s great. There are some subjective elements that may displease certain users more so than others. One of those elements is common to 2-in-1 PCs: the keyboard has a bit of flex, so you’ll want to use it on a flat desk or table. This doesn’t seem to bother some users, but it does feel awkward to me. The problem isn’t severe — the flex is very slight. The other issue is the keyboard layout. The biggest issue here is the right Shift key, which is small in size and placed to the right of the “Up” arrow key. This differs from many keyboards, which have a full-sized right Shift key located above the arrow keys. It’s not a huge problem, but if you’re not used to typing with this keyboard layout, that small Shift key will cause you to fumble for a little while. As with all things, though, you will get used to it in time with enough practice, so it’s up to the user whether this is any significant annoyance. Finally, the audio coming straight from the Miix 510’s speakers isn’t anything to call home about, but we didn’t expect it to be. The highs and mid notes are fine, but the bass is lackluster. It’s perfectly suitable for listening to things while working, but you’d want to have a pair of headphones nearby for any movies or music. Wrap-up The Lenovo Miix 510 isn’t a Surface, but it’s a suitable substitution. Lenovo’s latest 2-in-1 PC packs a bunch of features we’re excited to see, wrapping them all up in a stylish shell. The display is great, as is the kickstand and overall design, and that’s just scratching the surface. The Miix 510 is a PC for professionals and those serious about their work…and the best part is its $600 starting price, undercutting the Surface Pro 4 by a couple hundred dollars. Available now from Lenovo’s website and other retailers. Note: The stylus is an optional accessory priced at about $40 USD.

Dan Ackerman of CNET called the new Pro a second-screen dream machine. “The inventive Touch Bar streamlines work and saves clicks, and Apple has improved almost every part of the thinner, lighter MacBook Pro, including a larger touchpad, faster components and a flatter keyboard. iPhone’s Touch ID is handy on the Mac, too.” Many believe that the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is overpriced. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] As Ackerman notes, however, the price of the Touch Bar Pro — which starts at $1,799 for the Pro with an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM — is very pricy when compared to the competition. The new MacBook Pro is considered overpriced by many who are looking for a competing ultrabook in the market. Judging by the reviews, they may want to take a look at the new Razer Blade Stealth. The $1,399 version of the Stealth includes a 12.5-inch Quad HD screen, a 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. For $200 more, you can have a 4K screen. Tech Radar gave the Stealth a perfect five stars. “The Razer Blade Stealth comes at a competitive price that demands attention over other higher priced Ultrabooks like the Dell XPS 13 and MacBook Pro. It performs better in a thinner and more affordable package than its competitors,” says critic Kevin Lee, who adds that the speedy Kaby Lake processor can handle heavy editing in both Photoshop and Lightroom without a hitch. Expert Reviews calls the new Razer Blade Stealth a Kaby Lake champion. “The Razer Blade Stealth is everything you could possibly want from an ultraportable laptop. It’s lightweight, packs a punch and is well worth showing off to the other less fortunate travellers on your morning commute.” The review especially praises the Chroma keyboard, where each key could be displayed with one of 17 million different colors. However, despite the higher specs on paper, critic Nathan Spendelow notes that the Stealth isn’t faster than the 13-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro. The Razer Blade Stealth has received excellent reviews. [Image by Daryl Deino] “The Razer Blade Stealth offers better specs for less money than the competition and includes features others lack, such as a high-res touch screen and full-size USB ports. The design is slick, the price is right, but it’s not as slim and portable as other 12-inch laptops,” says CNET columnist Dan Ackerman, adding that — like others — the thick bezel around the screen is outdated. However, as good as the reviews have been, there have been some complaints from new Razer Blade Stealth owners on Reddit. “So, I’m using the new Razer Blade Stealth and it’s making a buzzing sound. Not to be confused with the coiling sound that I’m aware of, but this noise sounds like a bee buzzing. Any idea on what it is?” asks user Thuggy_Puggy, to which other users answered that it is actually part of the coil whine problem. The new Razer Blade Stealth, Lenovo Yoga 910, and Dell XPS 13 laptops that run the latest Intel 7th-generation processor have all received complaints regarding the fan noise being out of the ordinary. It’s likely that a BIOS update will make the noise on these devices controllable. For now, however, one can go into the Power settings and set the maximum processor speed to 99 percent — this has worked for many owners of all three of these ultrabooks. It’s important to note that there may be a significant amount of Razer Blade Stealth owners with complaints on Reddit, but the same can be said about the Lenovo Yoga 910, the Dell XPS 13, and even the MacBook Pro. Those satisfied with their computers aren’t as loud as those who aren’t satisfied. Still, one should check out the Razer Blade Stealth at the Microsoft Store to make sure the ultrabook fits their needs. Judging by the reviews, the Razer Blade Stealth is certainly on its way to mainstream success.

Here are the top reasons the company is leading in this industry. John Bromels (Truth2Power) Dec 19, 2016 at 11:44AM In November, General Electric (NYSE:GE) convened its fifth annual "Minds + Machines" event in the heart of tech country, San Francisco. This was the company's chance to highlight how far it's come in its quest to reinvent itself as "the digital industrial company" and share its outlook for the future.  There was a lot of information in the presentations for investors, as a lineup of bigwigs from not only GE, but also tech industry partners Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled products and plans for this emerging sector. Here are the top investor takeaways. GE is in the midst of a transformation to become the "digital industrial company." Image source: Getty Images. Digital is already paying off Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of GE Digital Harel Kodesh opened his presentation with a joke: Boy, what a difference the years make. You know, I remember two years ago, I was interviewing with Jeff Immelt, and I half-jokingly said said that in five years, people will be thinking of GE as a software company that also builds jet engines and MRI machines. And I think I was a little bit too conservative, because it's really coming together. He may have been joking, but he's not exaggerating. Today the company boasts of having used its Predix software platform to manage "smart buildings in San Diego, gas trains in Dubai, ships somewhere over the North Atlantic, factory automation in the central U.S.," and optimizing the U.S. rowing team in the Rio Olympics...just for fun. Services -- including software and analytics -- tend to be much more profitable than manufacturing. GE doesn't break out its profit margins on equipment vs. services in its reporting. But in 2014, CEO Jeff Immelt revealed in a presentation that GE's industrial services had about a 30% profit margin. That's more than double the company's overall operating margin, which was only 14.2% that year.  And the digital services revenue should come in even faster as GE ramps up its efforts. "This year, we have onboarded 19,000 developers," said Kodesh. "We will exceed the number we set for ourselves -- 20,000 -- by the end of the year. ... It's red hot." That's good: it means these efforts will pay off even sooner for investors. Living on the edge When it first launched, Predix was just a cloud-based operating platform. Once apps were developed for the platform -- apps to analyze data from or to operate GE's industrial machinery and systems -- those apps could be selected by a customer and run. That's good as it is, because it creates an ongoing need for GE's operational and analytical software. But now, GE is taking it to the next level with what they're calling "edge technology." Edge technology involves installing a Predix-enabled "edge device" -- a sensor, for example -- on a piece of industrial equipment. The sensor sits on the "edge" of the cloud, relaying data from the equipment to the cloud, and then pulling analysis from the cloud to give feedback to the equipment's operator or to make adjustments to the machine's operations directly.  Of course, this is of limited value if your facility can't access the cloud. That's why GE has partnered with Microsoft to make Predix available through Microsoft Azure. Microsoft is also leading the global rollout of Predix, which it is uniquely qualified to do. As Microsoft's Kevin Dallas boasted at the Minds + Machines conference, Microsoft has an "enterprise-grade hyperscale cloud" in 38 regions across the globe -- more than Alphabet's Google and Amazon combined.  With its global industrial equipment business, global access to the cloud is vital to GE for successful development of Predix. It also should be a valuable asset to Microsoft, if GE can execute its plan to make Predix the dominant platform for the Industrial Internet of Things.  Heavyweight partners Unlike an equipment sale, which ends once the machinery is delivered and the bill is paid, the sale of an operating system and analytical software -- particularly a cloud-based system -- requires ongoing interaction. GE is hoping to exploit this to establish long-term relationships with both its customers and business partners. For Microsoft, the relationship is not just one of service provider and client. As a result of its partnership with GE, Microsoft has begun to move beyond providing software "as is" and is now receiving a lot of interest from its industrial customers in creating custom software for their devices.  Intel is both a GE customer and a partner: It is not only working with GE on building out its industrial internet capabilities, but also uses Predix to operate its plant in Chandler, Arizona. And according to Marcus Kennedy, Intel's director of commercialization for industrial solutions, the choice to partner with GE was very simple: Intel realizes that the Industrial Internet of Things is going to look very different from the consumer Internet of Things, he said. Kennedy asked, "Who better to partner with on the industrial internet than someone who's been in the industrial space for more than 100 years?"  This is a big advantage for GE as it continues to grow its digital capabilities. It starts with a massive global footprint, deep pockets, and a very powerful industrial brand. It can use these advantages to leverage support from major tech partners like Microsoft and Intel, which in turn benefit from getting in on the ground floor. And by making these investments early and ramping up quickly, GE has an excellent shot at becoming the dominant player in the space. As Kodesh remarked, "We are emerging as the only solution for the industrial ecosystem." Investor takeaway It's very clear that GE's efforts to become "the digital industrial company" are more than just lip service. The company has invested heavily in the technology and is hiring the developers and making the strategic partnerships necessary to make its digital efforts a success. These investments are already bearing fruit in the form of clients and revenue.  In spite of all these new developments, though, GE's stock has barely budged, up less than 2% so far this year and up only 18% over the past three years. If you believe that GE can successfully execute its plans and build a $15 billion software business by 2020 -- and the evidence certainly suggests that it can -- the stock looks underappreciated by the market. Investors should expect good things from GE Digital in the coming years.

John Kasich, the Ohio governor and failed GOP presidential candidate, will get a vote in the Electoral College, according to a “faithless elector” who says he’ll buck norms and not support President-elect Donald Trump. “I have an important duty as one of the 538 Electors,” says Chris Suprun, an attention-seeking Texas elector wrote Monday in an op-ed for The Hill. “Instead of voting for Donald Trump, I will be casting my ballot for Ohio Governor John Kasich,” the self-righteous Suprun states. “A recent poll shows the majority of Americans want today’s Electoral College vote delayed, which is why I’m asking my fellow Republican Electors to vote for Governor Kasich, in order to force the vote to the House of Representatives,” he adds. Here’s what happens if a ‘faithless elector’ goes rogue:  Suprun says the delay he hopes to cause — pushing the decision on who should succeed President Barack Obama until Jan. 6 when the votes are certified in the House of Representatives — is because he’s worried about Russian interference in the election. “[T]he Electoral College should have been briefed by the CIA,” he says, adding that lawmakers have been briefed by national intelligence agencies. Suprun so far is the only Electoral College Republican who has publicly pledged to toss tradition and vote for the person he wants to be president, instead of the candidate voters in his state supported. Unlike 29 other states, Texas does not bind electors to cast a vote for the candidate who won the state. Trump won 306 electoral votes, compared to Hillary Clinton’s 232 – less than the 270 needed to win. Elsewhere, state representative Christina Hagan, an Ohio elector, announced Monday that she will step down from her constitutional role in the Electoral College. The move comes after Hagan was facing a lawsuit due to her dual role as both an elector and state rep. Hagan vacated her spot, she said, to allow Monday’s Electoral College vote to proceed smoothly. “I did not step down due to the liberal left’s lawsuit. I stepped down to ensure they did not slow the process of electing the president in any way,” she told the Dispatch. “I am a firm believer that this is intended to be a peaceful transition regardless of their attempts to create excess hardships and havoc. I will be speaking today within the Senate Chamber to fellow supporters,” she said.

Javier Orensanz, general manager of ARM's Development Solutions Group, says the company “will use its newly acquired capabilities to accelerate its adoption in HPC and new markets.” Allinea's CEO David Lecomber says he's on board with that ambition and that “the whole Allinea organization remains together - as one HPC Tools team within ARM.” And that team will keep working multiple CPU architectures. ARM was already working on tools similar to Allinea's. Those efforts will now be combined and new people hired. It's generally agreed that machine learning and data analytics are going to become very, very big, and that lots of very, very, big computers are going to be required to run such workloads at very, very big scale. Which is why ARM wants in to the market in which its many virtues present a fine alternative to the Xeon and Power CPUs that currently dominate the field. ARM has a couple of early successes on its resume, notably Fujitsu picking ARM for a 1,000-PFLOPS super in Japan. The previous, SPARC-powered, version of that machine used 705,000 cores. Just how many it will need this time around hasn't been specified. The Register suspects the answer is “a very, very big number.” Which by coincidence is probably what ARM hopes will one day land on its balance sheet if its HPC push succeeds. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Xen 4.8 debuts, gives ARM servers vendors a reason to hope Good news for embedded virtualisers, Debian users and anyone who likes stability 2 Comments Qualcomm joins Xen Project Advisory Board And comes right out and says why: it wants more ARM-powered servers and clouds 3 Comments Fujitsu: Why we chose 64-bit ARM over SPARC for our exascale super Hot Chips Clue: When was the last time you heard nice things about SPARC Linux? 24 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

View Latest Posts >>> The Coming War on Pedophilia? By Preston James, Ph.D on December 18, 2016 Advice for President-Elect Trump on what must be done to attain his Agenda for America by  Preston James The late Jimmy SaVILE… Denny Hastert… behold the revolving door of nationally or internationally networked molesters. It was said that Sandusky was allegedly “just the driver for bigger fish” What is Donald Trump’s best path to attain the full agenda that he energetically promised to the American voters? And what actions could he take that could disprove the DNC and Major Mass Media allegations that he is a billionaire that has always had a silver spoon in his mouth. That he promised everything that dissatisfied Americans wanted to hear just to get elected and once in office will service his wealth one-percenter buddies? The best advice that can be given to him is to maintain the same strategy that won him the election, to mobilize and strengthen a growing emergent American Populism. This same American Populism that has emerged largely from the Alternative media of the worldwide Internet now demands and end to DC cronyism and endemic corruption that has occurred at every level of the USG. Trump’s winning strategy was to mobilize this emergent populist mass dissatisfaction of the American workers and disenfranchised middle class. Trump’s canny ability to focus on his adversary’s weaknesses were quickly strengthened and magnified by the massive leaks of DNC related emails published by Wikileaks. And no one yet has provided any evidence these emails were not genuine, and the Controlled Major Mass Media, an illegal News Cartel itself, has accepted them as legitimate despite frequent attempts to paint Trump as an enemy of We The People. News Cartel Trump’s campaign strategy, which turned out to be extremely effective included very canny edgy comments delivered daily that grabbed the headlines and main talking points.  His very greatest opposers, the CMMM, is run by six Media Moguls who answer to a large investment house in Switzerland that claims to be on the vanguard of investments. These CMMM enemies turned out to be Trump’s greatest campaign asset by providing hundreds of millions of dollars of free campaign advertising. How could this be you might ask, when the CMMM continually broadcast negative reports about Trump? Most Americans rejected at face value all these negative CMMM taking points about Trump, thus reinforcing their distrust of the USG itself and the CMMM. The more that the CMMM kept broadcasting anti-Trump news that seemed noticeably biased and false, the more the American masses supported Trump. I will not recite Trump’s populist agenda here because it is available at numerous sources and most know it by heart already. City of London statue But it is fair to say that not only is his agenda going to be extremely difficult to attain as promised, but in fact, his only chance of doing it is to capture a majority of Americans for full and energetic support. And this means he will have to win some of his opposers over to his way of thinking in full support of his agenda if he is to be able to fully attain it. Like it or not, the Clinton and Obama Presidencies have been unable to reverse all the massive damage to the American economic system that was created by GHWB and his Cabal and by Bush2, which many now realize was fully authorized by the City of London private Banksters and the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (RKM). Two Gulf wars and war in Afghanistan, set up as perpetual wars to be continually lost like Korea and Vietnam, have drained the US taxpayers’ wealth and transferred it to the Defense Contractors (especially the no bid types) and the large RKM related bloodline families which own large blocks of their stock. How did America end up being run by a foreign espionage front, the City of London Rothschild Khazarian Mafia private Fiat Banksters? And ever since a major coup d’état against America was successfully implemented in 1913, our manufacturing of US Money and its distribution has been hijacked by a foreign espionage entity dedicated to the complete asset stripping and destruction of America. The means to do this was for the US Banksters (aka the Federal Reserve, a foreign owned bank, a franchise of the Rothschild City of London private Fiat Banking System), to form a critical alliance with the Saudis and some other Mideast oil producers. This oil alliance was a three way agreement between the major oil companies, these oil producers and the USG. It involved the US Military and NATO providing complete military protection for these oil producers as long as they agreed to accept US Dollars for their oil. Nixon and Kissinger This caused the US dollar to become the Reserve Currency for the whole world and the USD became referred to as the US Petro Dollar. At about the same time, Nixon under the advice of Kissinger, removed the requirement that the US Dollar had to be backed by Gold and Silver, transforming them into Federal Reserve interest bearing Debt notes only. This was completely unconstitutional and illegal and was soon followed by the theft of all American gold from Fort Knox and other repositories by the COL RKM Banksters. The bottom line to this hijacking of our own Constitutional money creation and distribution system is this: We The People have been forced by our own USG to pay usury to use what should have been our own Constitutional money in the first place and have also been forced to pay illegal Federal taxes which were imposed the say way that the COL RKM Banksters hijacked our money creation and distribution system in the first place—by bribing and human compromising our elected politicians and our President to violate the US Constitution and Rule of Law. Once our Constitution and Rule of Law was violated by these foreign based COL Banksters (an act of blatant foreign espionage against America), it was then easy for these Banksters to proceed to buy off, human compromise and coerce almost every single top USG official, elected or appointed. Those that don’t cooperate are then voted out by various sophisticated means like massive support for a selected opponent, redistricting, wrongly, falsely smearing. This was done to Representative Cynthia McKinney and also to Senator Dave Durenberger. Or prosecuting and/or jailing by use of trumped-up fake charges and fake evidence like what was done to Governor Don Siegelman or Representative James Traficant (both were completely innocent). Some believe that James Traficant was murdered in a staged tractor accident upon orders by the SPC (COL RKM) at his farm after his release from prison. Putin and the Russians had nothing to do with the DNC’s emails being leaked and published by Wikileaks. The claim that he did by elements in the CIA’s top management, DNC leaders and the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) is a psyop to derail Trump’s election win by manipulating the Electoral College electors. This Psyop is perhaps also based on the fear that Wikileaks is a Mossad Op and Trump is perhaps being manipulated covertly by RKM Zios without his knowledge in a very crafty covert operation to put him in power where they can manipulate and use externally based economic and political forces to manipulate him. The best guess who provided the DNC emails to Wikileaks which appear to have originated with the NSA raw data is an American Intel group. A very good bet is that it is a group of deep black, high ranking American Intel insiders who have access to all NSA raw data provided the DNC emails to Wikileaks or some other group that has such access. This Psyop which wrongly blames Putin obviously ignores is any attention to the fact that none of the leaked emails have been contested and claimed to be untrue. Nor has the DC Establishment, the FBI or the CMMM viewed them as evidence of major RICO crimes as they should for such crimes as illegally manipulating the nomination process to move Bernie Sanders out of the nomination process. This is where the emphasis should be. And major LE efforts should be made to prosecute the BCC and many others for all the Mideast war crimes and lies which resulted in the functional financial demise of the USA and millions of needless deaths, including the thousands of dead, suicided and disabled American Soldiers. Some insiders claim that the DC Establishment greatly fear Trump because he is not believed to be a member of any Secret Society or the Satanic Pedophile Network, which most top Republican, as well as top Democrat Members of Congress, are alleged to be. If true, this would likely make it extremely difficult or impossible for the DC Establishment to control him. Trump has no chance to succeed in attaining his agenda unless he deals head on with this massive financial theft and fraud of American wealth by the foreign espionage system (the COL RKM) which runs the Federal Reserve System. This COL/RKM Banksters system has imposed the massive fraud that We The People owe them trillions of dollars in interest for using what should have been our own money in the first place. Actually under US Law and the US Constitution we owe them NOTHING. There is no legitimate Federal Debt nor is their self-imposed name the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) legitimate either. The FRS is no more a part of the USG than federal express which is a private corporation. With proper executive PDD orders signed by Trump and proper adjudication, the FRS could be eliminated, the owners convicted of massive RICO Financial Fraud and all their assets could be clawed back because there is no statute of limitations on fraud. So if Trump wants to succeed he will have to credibly communicate the conclusion to We The People that there is no legitimate Federal Debt owed to the FRS (franchisee of the COL RKM private Fiat Banksters) and that this must be immediately corrected with all stolen funds recovered and returned to taxpayers. Trump must gain massive support of We The People and Congress to dump the FRS. This will be necessary to cancel this phony FRS US National Debt and take the creation and distribution of American money back into the US Treasury, where it must be backed by Gold, Silver clawed back from the COL/RKM Banksters that stole it beginning in 1971. Government owned commodities and real estate can also be used to back the US Dollar. Trump’s biggest enemies will be those who have been inducted into the large Satanic Pedophile Network (SPN) which is run as a massive human compromise, mind-kontrol system by the COL RKM used to keep initiates compromised, blackmailable and in line. This massive SPN is financed in America by the City of London RKM private Fiat central Banksters through their largest franchise, the Federal Reserve System (FRS). This provides endless funds supply of funds to buy, bribe and finance any necessary human compromise operations including the Satanic Pedophile Network which is used to keep top USG Officials and major Corp leaders (including the CMMM moguls) in line, doing what the COL/RKM Banksters and their Superiors demand. _________ Perpetual Wars and the Seeds of Gladio “New Gladio” Historically it has been is generally recognized that for any ruler to consolidate power he must engage in a serious pre-engineered war with another nation or nations. In the past other leaders split this into real foreign wars (unconstitutional, perpetual, undeclared, unwinnable) and created other “social wars” on the home front, like the war on poverty, the war on crime, the war on drugs, and now the war on terrorism. The Bush Crime Cabal (BCC) working at the direction of the COL RKM Banksters very craftily created a new major world war that was also brought home to America’s mainland. This new War on Terror was created through the use of NATO’s Operation Gladio left-behind Nazi Army and hired CIA mercenaries, largely financed by Saudi Arabia. These disposable mercenaries have been deeply mind-kontrolled by certain large DOD contractors who deployed some very sophisticated mind-kontrol technologies based on remote psychotronic brain entrainment. Their leaders have been high ranking CIA, Mossad and IDF who have all lost their very souls during initiation human compromise rituals. If Trump tries to attain his agenda without cancelling the fraudulent imaginary US National Debt, he will be doomed to failure. Why is this? Because the US Petro Dollar is well on its way to rejection as the world’s reserve currency and in addition this imaginary unconstitutional and illegal multi-trillion dollar FRS debt bomb will finish off We The People by asset stripping us right into the street, homeless unless it is exposed as a fraud and cancelled by Trump as soon as he is seated. If he tries to cancel this fraudulent imaginary FRS/COL RKM US National Debt without complete populist support of We The People, he will fail because the Satanic Pedophile Network (SPN) runs the CIA and most of DC (including the top Democrats, top Republicans, and every official USG agency, as well as the CMMM. In practical terms this means that those Democratic and Republican leaders and high USG and Intel officials compromised by their secret evil pedophile addictions and membership in the SPN could be easily coerced by the COL RKM (the folks who control the SPN) to thwart Trump on all fronts. The only way for Trump to neutralize these opponents is to continue reinforcing American populism and then mobilizing it to attack these high USG and Intel officials held captive by the SPN. To defeat his opponents and attain his agenda, Trump must create a new War on Pedophilia in America. He knows that America cannot afford any more expensive foreign wars so it must be a war against evil at home and nothing is more real or more evil, or more easy to prove that the presence of this very large, very powerful SPN that controls the DC Establishment, the top Corporate leaders, Intel and USG agencies. American mothers are a sleeping populist giant that once awakened can easily be mobilized to attack this large and powerful SPN on all fronts, especially by petitioning, calling, writing and demonstrating against the CMMM who will work to cover it up. If Trump really wants and intends to drain The Swamp, then he will need most Americans to support his efforts in this Once the American mothers find out how massive this Pedophile problem is within the USG and that the CMMM has been covering it up along with the FBI for many years, they will create a massive unending populist sh*t-storm against the SPC, the FBI and the CMMM. Det. James Rothstein, NYCPD Gold Shield, Police Intel, NY Crime Commission Special Squad (now retired). America’s No. 1 expert in sex trafficking, organized pedophile human compromise ops and illegal narcotics trafficking. Responsible for the prosecution and conviction of more high level human compromise criminals than any other LE person in America. Det. Rothstein is a totally stand up man who can be trusted and has a distinguished record that is unmatched. Note that the FBI makes token arrests of the small independent Pedophile Networks that arise from the websites that they themselves set up as entrapment stings to fool the public and keep their cover-up in place. Trump can take care of these soulless scumbags by bringing massive anti-trust to break up these six CMMM and by prosecuting them for serving as a front for the foreign espionage of the COL/RKM private central Fiat Banksters. It is these COL/RKM Banksters who are using the FRS trying to completely asset strip the America worker and taxpayer, to start and then destroy America the Republic and Balkanize it into ten separate Globalist/NWO territories. Actually this War on Pedophilia would be a great means for Trump to mobilize the American mothers who are the SPN’s greatest potential enemy. This fact has been stated numerous times publicly by the foremost expert of Pedophilia and sex trafficking Detective James Rothstein (NYCPD Gold Shield, Police Intel, NY Crime Commission Special Squad). Detective Rothstein has claimed that the only effective mass weapon that can be deployed against the Pedophile Network to stop it cold is a change in the laws covering investigation, by providing protection for Police and LE that investigate and prosecute these unimaginably evil crimes. Effective action must include massive publication of this Pedophile Network by the Alternative Media on the Internet to the point it awakens and angers the mothers of America in mass and drives these facts into the mainstream news. Detective Rothstein has claimed that as high as 70% of high USG officials have been compromised by Pedophilia. Two separate investigations of Congress about 25 years ago (one from an FBI deep cover informant, the other by LE Intel) showed that 39% and 42% of male members of the US Congress were so compromised. _________ Conclusion Nothing makes American mothers more enraged than pedophile crimes against young defenseless children by high politicians that abuse their power and trust given them by the voters. Some of these crimes at the highest levels of the SPN include torture, murder, vivisection, cannibalism after the sexual abuse and rape. When the American women become informed of these high level crimes en masse, they will become enraged. And nothing could ever be more powerful than American Women enraged en masse over these extreme crimes against defenseless children and infants, NOTHING. Trump must activate this rage by publicizing this problem, setting up a clean special independent prosecutor and recommending special grand juries in every state to investigate and charge. If promised protection, numerous seasoned LE and Intel will come forth and present rock solid evidence. Immunity agreements can be made with many folks at the periphery of the SPN who would have otherwise testified against it but for their fear of being immediately murdered. The iron grip over DC of the COL/RKM’s Satanic Pedophile Network (SPN) will be exposed and broken. Trump is the only one that has the power to do this and to mobilize massive emergent American Populism. Once he has done this, he can fully attack the SPN, which will break the control that the COL/RKM Banksters exercise over America at every level. If Trump refuses to go after the COL/RKM private Banksters and their espionage front the FRS; refuses to cancel the US National Debt after exposing it as a fraud; refuses to dump the FRS and bring all money creation and distribution into the US Treasury; stop charging interest to use what should have been our own real money in the first place; refuses to prosecute the RKM/COL/FRS kingpin-owners under RICO; refuses to break up the CMM and prosecute them under RICO; refuses to expose the massive existence of the Satanic Pedophile Network and to fully investigate and prosecute all top members to the fullest extent possible under RICO and murder; refuses to mobilize the American mothers in mass to support him and also fight against these soulless pedophile scum in high places; … then we must all assume that he was put in place by the head of the Zionist Globalists themselves by deployment of a very crafty, deep black covert operation. _________ _____________ Related Posts: Unprecented: President to Enter White House Facing Child Rape Trial Imagine if Donald Trump actually did become American president Israel: The Elephant in the US Election President Barack Obama Strikes back at Donald Trump Lawmaker says Russia-US ties may change if Trump elected US president The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Log in to Reply Howard T.Lewis III  December 21, 2016 at 2:07 pm Back in 1971 we took on these swine as a pack of high schoolers. I was 17 and spent some time face to face with several of Seattle’s finest in front of a huge under aged keg party, The cops respected us and our attitudes and NEVER took our keg. No parents were available to back us up, and one of my friend’s younger brother had been kidnapped after a ‘party’ thrown by a group who later became Bush43 neocons after serving Washington State U.S. Senator henry Jackson up until about 1984. Huma Abedin and the Podesta brothers spent time around them in 1983 and probably more often. Do lobbying efforts as a group because just one or two people are easily dismissed with a quick lie or two. We got the neocon’s pedopimp for Queen Anne Hill area busted and sent to MacNeill Island, which is more than anybody else did that I ever saw. They really had no choice. The photo of Johnny Gosch as a kidnapped paperboy was probably taken just after these ‘chicken hawks’ cruised Seattle and Lynnwood to the north. With out concerted cooperative effort by citizens, little impact will be made without radical behavior, which is usually proven counter productive. Our way worked until we believed an adult would pick up the ball and run with it. My friend;s parents spent a lot of money on attorneys but the neocons just laughed at them. They were at this party, which they hosted. Log in to Reply JS  December 19, 2016 at 9:07 pm Good article! You said, “American mothers are a sleeping populist giant…” I’d like to add, dads too! And let’s not forget the legions of grandmothers and grandfathers, who have more time to devote to this, and just as much passion. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  December 19, 2016 at 9:12 pm Good point. Normally the mothers must get enraged first and put pressure on the men they know (husbands and brothers) to do something. Politicians would likely be afraid of mass uprisings by women more than men, and mothers have very strong instincts about protecting their children and other children too.

Log in to Reply Jim Denton  December 20, 2016 at 8:10 pm absolutely agree Trump is just as much a part of the globalists as hillary, with his allegence on the rothchild side of the rockefeller/rothshild cabal. JohnZ  December 19, 2016 at 7:59 am Another excellent article. The COL RKM has perverted every government it has come into contact with. They, the RKM are themselves perverted and degenerate beyond imagination. The only way to stop this is to eliminate the COL RKM and that means physical destruction. The Rothchild family itself must be rooted out and removed from society. Its wealth returned to the people from which it stole it from and those family members to be imprisoned perpetually. The end of the Federal Reserve is going to take more than just words, after all, consider JFK had written a presidential order to shut it down and look what happened to him. The only way to destroy this evil is to destroy the evil behind it and the only way to accomplish this is for a president or leader to become absolutely ruthless in their campaign. This world will have no peace as long as the COL RKM exists. It feeds on war and death. This monster needs to be exterminated. Log in to Reply wjabbe  December 19, 2016 at 6:00 am Trump rarely if ever talked about the national debt during the campaign. He did indicate he detests settling cases and would prefer to run them to their conclusion via a jury verdict. He did the unusual act of settling his Trump University case by paying $25 million to move it off the books before Jan. 20, but many more cases are in the pipeline. He talked about forcing other countries to pay more for our security protection. He specifically criticized Janet Yellin of the FED but was unspecific about his criticisms. He is obviously a bully. Perhaps he plans to walk away from the national debt. But all H will break loose if he does. However I could see him doing this and perhaps this is why the powers that be fear him so. Who knows? The strategy of the article is good if he would follow it. And remember is he is an expert at money and how to move it from other bank accounts to his bank accounts. He also stated he would not accept any salary for doing this difficult job which is a credit to him if he keeps his word on this.

Download Drivers and BIOS for MSI’s GL62 6QF Notebook Model The files are compatible with Windows 7 and 10 64-bit OSes Dec 19, 2016 14:52 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  MSI has rolled out the drivers for its GL62 6QF notebook model compatible with the 64-bit version of Microsoft’s Windows 7 and 10 operating systems, which should provide improved performance and usability. When it comes to the producers providing these files, know that Intel has put on the line its Chipset, Management Engine (ME), Rapid Storage Technology (RST), and USB 3.0 packages, while Realtek will enable the full functionality of the audio card and card reader component. In addition to that, Intel takes care of the device’s wireless capabilities (both WLAN and Bluetooth), Synaptics implements several Touchpad-related features, and Qualcomm ensures the unit’s Ethernet connection works properly.

Cow urine, commonly known as ‘gomutra’ is used in many Indian cultures for therapeutic purposes. Concoctions having cow urine as the main ingredient are mentioned in the Ayurveda (the traditional Hindu system of medicine) as miracle medicine for a number of diseases including cancer. The Bharatiya Janata Party– led Indian Government hopes to introduce this elixir to the world by promoting large scale research to validate its medicinal properties. A recent workshop held at New Delhi’s prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) witnessed a number of research proposals floated by scientists and medical practitioners. Sources in the Ministry of Human Resource Development told Sputnik that the government is seriously considering one of the proposals that envisage setting up of a ‘Gow Vigyan Vishwavidyalaya’ (Cow Science University). Research at the university would mainly be geared towards validating cancer curing properties of Panchgavya- a concoction of cow urine, cow dung, milk and milk products. The government has set up a steering committee that would examine all the 40 proposals floated at the workshop and shortlist some for further action. The proposed research would be supported and funded by not only India’s Ministry of Health but also the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development and the Indian Council of Medical Research. Dr RS Chauhan of College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Uttarakhand, claims that his research on cow urine has revealed that certain components help in enhancing immunity and kills cancer. If approved, he will take the research further to test its effects on humans. Cow is revered as a holy animal in India by Hindus. It has been a priority for the Narendra Modi led government to protect this bovine creature and support industries derived from its waste. The government has spent around $87 million on cow shelters, ban on cow slaughter and sale of cow meat and tightened measures to stop the illicit sale of cattle to neighboring countries. The increased protection and reverence given to cow has even led to inter-faith conflict in recent times.

A filing with the Korean regulatory authorities that was reported in The Korea Herald said: We are looking into various options, including setting up a joint venture with Seagate Technology PLC, to strengthen the mid and long-term competitiveness of our nonvolatile storage flash chips. But no decision has yet been made. Obviously neither Seagate nor SK Hynix are making any public comments about their talks and the progress, or lack of progress, made. But the background of the disk-to-flash storage transition and the technological and broad business trends affecting both companies is obvious. First of all, the disk drive market is declining as primary data storage in all sorts of devices changes from disk to flash, based on flash providing faster access to data with lower power and cooling needs. A flash foundry operator, like SK Hynix, needs product development, manufacturing and distribution channel capabilities to take its flash chip output. A vertically integrated, disk-based, development, manufacturing and distribution channel operator like Seagate needs to replicate its disk business model in the flash/SSD business, where it can bring its product and distribution-level expertise to bear on a flash output facility. Weak players Both companies are weak players in the flash chip and drive market. According to Trendfocus, in second 2016 quarter SSD market share terms: Samsung was number 1 with 40.8 per cent WD had 13.6 per cent Toshiba had 6 per cent Intel had 6.8 per cent Micron had 3.7 per cent SK Hynix had 3.4 per cent Seagate had 0.1 per cent Various suppliers such as Kingston (9.4 per cent), Lite-On (9.7 per cent) and others (6.5 per cent) made up the difference. The third quarter didn't provide any comfort for either SK Hynix or Seagate; Trendfocus SSG market shares in third 2016 quater Both Seagate and SK Hynix can see that 3D NAND is the last technology card left to play in the flash chip/drive market and that some other technology, such as 3D XPoint and ReRAM will take over in the 2020s. They can either get a real stake in the non-volatile chip/drive business now or wait and be banished from it, or find it hugely more expensive to buy their way in later. Seagate situation With WDC and Toshiba in a flash foundry alliance, and Intel and Micron ditto, then Seagate, number 2 in a 3-player disk drive market and arch apostle of vertical integration in the disk drive manufacturing business, is in a dreadful situation. It has had alliances with Samsung and, latterly with Micron, while espousing the message that it’s fine to buy NAND flash chips in the general market rather than be having strategic relationships with foundry manufacturers. Everyone and their brother seriously doubts this. The Seagate-Micron relationship was revealed in February 2015, and one aspect of this was to secure a strategic supply of Micron flash chips for Seagate. However, the Nytro XF1230 SATA SSD which Seagate announced in August 2016 uses SK Hynix chips and an SK Hynix LAMD controller. Clearly, at that point, Seagate’s commitment to Micron flash was weaker than thought. SK Hynix situation SK Hynix is primarily a DRAM supplier, number 2 after Samsung, with NAND as its secondary interest. It has partnered HP (HPE) over the long-delayed Memristor technology. However HPE is now allying with SanDisk over ReRAM. ReRAM together Micron and Intel’s XPoint looks like the leading contenders to replace NAND when that technology runs out of density development steam. In NAND, SK Hynix is a distant follower to the other foundry operators, with Samsung, WDC-Toshiba and Intel-Micron far ahead in terms of market share. How can SK Hynix develop its non-volatile chip foundry business when these other foundry makers are directly involved with product development and have better distribution channel? It needs to drastically enhance its product development and distribution channel capabilities. Comment on a joint venture Seagate is an obvious potential partner. Business Korea, citing industry sources, suggests SK Hynix would own 51 per cent of the potential JV with Seagate owning the rest. SK Hynix could pump in its NAND chips and controller technology, with Seagate contributing its controller and flash drive product capabilities, and its distribution channels to take the JV’s product output. The JV could use Intel and Micron’s IMTF JV and the WDC (SanDisk)-Toshiba relationship as models to show what’s possible. There are substantial issues to be resolved in any negotiations, such as funding, staffing, locations, leadership and so forth. Seagate, with two previous attempts at NAND flash chip tech supply deals behind it (Micron apparently, and Samsung before that) needs to show it can partner in this area. We wonder, as does a Seeking Alpha writer whether Seagate tried pursuing a closer deal with Micron? Setting up a JV with SK Hynix would be universally seen as a good thing, and show that Seagate’s leadership is still alert to strategic necessities, beyond relying mostly on fat, capacity-optimised disk drives for its future revenues. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Flash?

How the hot startup that stole Apple's thunder wound up in Silicon Valley's graveyard Tech Insider 12/18/2016 Steve Kovach © Provided by Business Insider Inc Eric Migicovsky For a moment, it looked like the story would have a happy ending. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 115.82 -0.91 -0.78% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.27 -0.39 -1.06% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Quanta Computer Inc S/GDR QUCCF = 8.91 0.00 0.00% As struggling smartwatch maker Pebble discussed selling itself to Fitbit, a larger competitor in the wearable technology market, the chatter among the Pebble team was that they would continue working on their product under the wing of a new, more stable corporate parent. Fitbit’s co-founder James Park even visited Pebble’s offices and, following a brief introduction from Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky, talked reassuringly about how excited he was to welcome Pebble into the Fitbit family. But within a month it became apparent that Fitbit’s $40 million acquisition wasn’t a lifeline for Pebble, it was a fire sale. Choice assets and employees were cherry picked, the rest discarded. Most employees out of Pebble's staff of about 100 were laid off, their stock suddenly worthless. It was a sad ending for a company once seen as a brilliant example of Silicon Valley chutzpah, a scrappy startup that had forced tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Google to play catch-up. But it also capped a tumultuous year of poor sales, supplier problems, failed acquisition talks, and a general lack of consumer interest in smartwatches, according to several sources that Business Insider spoke to.  And at a time when Silicon Valley is racing towards the next big thing, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars, the demise of Pebble is a stark reminder that even the most promising and buzzed about innovations don’t always survive the harsh realities of the marketplace. "By the time we got into late spring and june of this year, I was like, OK, it does not look good," one Pebbler insider said. "I didn't think we were going to make it to 2017. It was dragged out forever." Early success According to the sources Business Insider spoke to, the signs of trouble for Pebble began to appear early on, though they were often ignored among the excitement of a nascent smartwatch business that many believed would be as big as smartphones. Pebble burst on to the scene in 2012 after launching what was then the most successful Kickstarter campaign in history, raising $10.2 million to fund the production of the first smartwatch. Pebble proved there was interest in the wrist-worn gadgets, well before Apple introduced the Apple Watch and other big tech companies followed suit. The first Pebble launched in early 2013 to positive reviews. Although it appealed mainly to techies, the product was a solid first attempt at a modern smartwatch. The watch could display notifications like incoming texts and calendar alerts and run a bunch of apps ranging from ESPN to Evenote. Pebble continued to launch new products, including the Pebble Time, the first device with Pebble’s new take on a smartwatch operating system.© Provided by Business Insider Inc pebble 2 timeline os But things started getting hairy in 2015 when Apple, the world's largest technology company, released its long-awaited smartwatch.  Migicovsky was unfazed by the new competition, telling Business Insider shortly after the Apple Watch was announced that he wasn't worried Apple might cut into his sales. "I think it will drive a lot more interest and a lot more volume at Pebble."  The Apple Watch did initially boost interest in Pebble, as consumers viewed Pebble's product as a cheaper, more capable alternative. But sales eventually began to shrink, sources say. Apple's brand was so strong, recalls one insider, that it sucked up all the oxygen.  And Apple's decades of product-building experience gave it another big advantage. Sources familiar with Pebble's supply chain said the company had difficulty paying suppliers building the products in Taiwan throughout 2015, especially payments related to production of the Pebble Time Round. In some cases, these suppliers would call for payments on outstanding purchase orders and get no response from Pebble. Some of those outstanding orders still remained unpaid by the time Fitbit entered acquisition talks with Pebble. Some people close to the company also blamed Pebble's supply chain team for playing favorites, attempting to move a lot of production from Taiwan-based Quanta Computer to Compal Electronics. Pebble continued to raise money through Kickstarter, sales of current products, and other private sources. But it wasn't enough to fund the production of new products.   The expected wave of consumer demand for smartwatches never materialized; even Apple appeared to be having trouble convincing the world that a smartwatch — like the iPhone — was another must-have gadget. The market was not as big as everyone had hoped, and the market was getting crowded. Layoffs and deal talks When Pebble's head of sales sent an email to his team after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday shopping weekend in 2015, there was no more ignoring the magnitude of the problem. Sales during the biggest shopping weekend of the year were down from the year before. If things didn't improve, the email warned ominously, adjustments would have to be made.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc Tim Cook Pebble's business never fully rebounded, and internal discussions began after the holiday shopping season about what changes needed to happen so that the company could survive. In March of 2016, Pebble laid off 25% of its staff, as Business Insider first reported. Pebble began searching for more outside investment or a possible buyer. One insider said they were asked to compile internal data about sales, which fueled speculation Pebble was trying to sell itself. By May of 2016, Migicosvky admitted to the staff that the company was trying to sell, but that a deal had recently fallen through. That deal turned out to be from chipmaker Intel, which wanted to buy Pebble for about $70 million. It's not clear why the deal fizzled, although it was Intel that ultimately walked away, not Pebble. (The Pebble side wanted the deal to happen.) One source close to Migicovsky said they were told that Intel's offer was initially higher than $70 million, but was lowered after due diligence. "Something rubbed him the wrong way and he was uncomfortable," the source close to Migicovsky said regarding the failed Intel deal. A high-profile collaboration with Japanese watchmaker Citizen also proved disappointing.  Pebble had hoped to learn from Citizen's expertise building and designing traditional watches. But throughout the development of the Time Round — a version of the Pebble watch with a circular screen that the two companies collaborated on — the Pebble team felt that Citizen lacked the technical chops in software and hardware development to be of much use, according to sources. Plus, Citizen typically took a lot longer to develop and launch products, often a year or more, which didn’t jibe with Pebble’s desire to push out new products faster. In the end, Pebble thought Citizen's designs were too thick and chunky and ultimately went with a design from internal Pebble employees. Pebble did pay Citizen about $50,000 for its work, according to one source with direct knowledge of the deal. Citizen did not respond to a request for comment. While TechCrunch reported that Citizen considered acquiring Pebble for roughly $740 million in 2015, no deal ever happened. One source directly familiar with Pebble's acquisition talks said Citizen never discussed buying Pebble, and accused someone of spreading a false rumor to TechCrunch. © Provided by Business Insider Inc pebble time round Facing the music Following the failed acquisition talks and the round of layoffs, Migicovsky leveled with his remaining employees late this spring. If they wanted to stay and see Pebble through to the end, their shares in the company would be doubled. If they wanted to cut their losses and leave, they would receive a severance package. While some took the buyout offer, most Pebble employees stuck with the company, hoping new products like the Pebble Time 2 watch and Pebble Core, a tiny device that lets you listen to Spotify music offline, would reinvigorate sales. In fact, Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core were on track for their launch at the beginning of 2017. As recently as a week before discussions with Fitbit began, Pebble employees were visiting their manufacturing partners in Asia and finalizing production plans for the new devices, sources say. In a  recent  interview with  Steven Levy of Backchannel , Migicovsky said  he he spent the summer months scrambling across the globe, trying unsuccessfully to raise money from private equity funds and other private investing groups.  Pebble was out of time and out of money. In October, at least one bank that gave  money to Pebble called in its loan, unconvinced Pebble would be able to raise more funding or sell enough product to solve its cash flow issues and debt to suppliers. Keep your resumes Once Migicovsky decided to sell the company, sources close to him say that his main goal was to find a buyer that would honor the consumers on Kickstarter who backed the Pebble Time 2 or Core — either by refunding their money or building the product.  Craig Barritt/Getty Images for AOL Inc. Fitbit turned out to be the only suitable buyer willing to do that. While the Time 2 and Core products have been canceled, Kickstarter backers will at least get their money back. Other aspects of the Fitbit deal have not unfolded as expected, however. The original deal discussions had Fitbit, which makes wearable products focused on health and fitness, acquiring all or most of Pebble, including the staff, several sources told Business Insider. But something changed as the deal was negotiated and Fitbit ended up buying only the software technology that runs Pebble's products and hiring certain employees.  One source speculated that Fitbit was worried about its stock price after delivering a disappointing sales forecast for the fourth quarter, which caused its stock to tank about 30%. Taking on all of Pebble could’ve looked extra risky to Fitbit investors. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to comment. On the day Fitbit’s team came to visit Pebble’s office about a month before the acquisition closed, many Pebble employees had concerns about what would happen to upcoming products. One source said Fitbit largely dodged those questions and that their true intentions didn’t come to light until they began interviewing Pebble employees. During the interviews, Fitbit quizzed Pebble employees on their roles at the company, but in the end Pebble employees learned there was no interest in the hardware team. Fitbit didn't even ask for resumes, according to one source, instead just pulling in their LinkedIn profiles. Once it became clear these interviews were going nowhere, Pebble hardware employees were encouraged to apply to open positions on Fitbit's website. By the time it was all over, most Pebble employees were sent home with severance packages. Many others took the Fitbit offer, and several former Pebble employees now list Fitbit as their employer on LinkedIn. As for Migicovsky, he'll be working at the startup incubator Y Combinator next year. Pebble's software may live on within Fitbit products, but it's now up to other companies to prove whether Pebble's pioneering product represents the future of computing or just an interesting footnote in history.

X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 + 5820k Overclock HELP!!! Thread: X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 + 5820k Overclock HELP!!! Tags: auto, cpu, freq, set, voltage TheThing said: 2 Weeks Ago X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 + 5820k Overclock HELP!!! Hi guys, I just assembled a new rig as follow: X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 5820K 16 GB G.Skill Ripjaws 4 - 3200 Mhz Samsung 950 PRO 512 Gb etc.etc. OS: Windows 10 PRO 64 I'm totally new to X99 boards and Intel -E cpus. I just tried to play a little with bios OC settings but I'm not sure at all about the meaning/effect of some of them. For ex. the System Agent is only mentioned as "Offset" setting while many MB (if not the large majority) simply allow the user choose the voltage freely. Also it seems to me that the bios do not display anywhere the System Agent actual (or starting)voltage. To begin with, I followed a suggestion found on the net: set the cpu multiplier to 45 and the vcore to 1.300 keeping all the other settings on auto. This way one can find out if his cpu is good or at least not bad with OC. Mine was able to boot and to load Windows. Some quick bench & stesstests (not hours) seemed to confirm that the system was stable. So, out of curiosity, I lowered the Vcore to 1.250: although I got in Windows and was able to do simple tasks (like running some programs, internet surfing, mail, etc.) the system was not fully stable under tests. It was also able to load Windows @4600 Mhz, same vcore.....of course even less stable. Then I tried to stabilize at least the 4500Mhz frequency, manipulating lot of settings (I got some info about them on the net) without any appreciable result. Here the settings that I manipulated in my attempts: Windows works in "performance mode" I left the ram to 2133 mhz, all settings on "auto" - BCLK Freq: left on "auto" , manually set to 100 (just to be sure) - Intel SpeedStep: basically always disabled. (I tried once, just to check every possibility, to keep it enabled....without any positive effect) - Long Duration Power Limit, Short DPL, Primary Plane Current Limit: tried both on "auto" and set 1000 for the tree of them ---> no apparent difference - Long Duration Mantained & CPUTJMax: always on "auto" - BCLK Spread Spectrum: I tried both enabled & disabled....does not seems to have much impact over stability - Filter PLL Freq: I tried "auto" & high but it does not have either positive or negative effect it seems....or at least I'm not able to evaluate it, same as BCLK Spectrum - System Agent Offset: basically Always on "auto". I tried a couple of time to set low values like 0.100/0.200 (range is 0.100-0.600) resulting in immediate system crash. - CPU Integrated VR Faults & CPU Integrated VR Efficiency: almost always disabled. Sometimes set on "auto" - CPU Input voltage: left on "auto", tried 1.900 & 1.950 ---> maybe a little better stability but nothing to talk about - CPU LLC: left on "auto", manually tried 1&3 without any visible benefits - CPU C State Support: almost always disabled. Tried once with enabled....no diffecence (apparently) - CPU Cache ratio ---> I left it on "auto", set it manually to 44, 42, 40, I also tried 38 - NO ADAPTIVE .....it seems to be ok only on "auto" that set it to 30x (definitely too low for 4500mhz CPU freq, I think) - CPU Cache voltage ---> left on auto, manually to: 1.200, 1.225 - NO ADAPTIVE .....here too, anything but "auto" seems to worsening the stability - CPU Vcore: I tried to rise a little bit (to 1.275) - NO ADAPTIVE, but still unstable under tests - DRAM Voltage, Activating Power Supply, PCH PLL Voltage, CPU I/O voltage, ME Voltage, PCH Voltage ----> all of them always on "auto" Here my hopes, for which I need your help: 1) I'd like to manage to stabilize the 4.500 mhz freq @ 1.250 Vcore if possible, because I feel that it can be done somehow (i.e. an OC expert could do it, probably). 2) I would like to know better which settings are really relevant and how to manage them in order to achieve the best freq @ the lowest Vcore possible. 3) I would like to know if I need to manually set some of the setting that I left Always on "auto" (like PCH PLL, CPU I/O voltages,etc. - see above) Finally, I'd like to know if I need to enable some "obscure" settings like Filter PLL Freq, CPU LCC, BCLK Spread Spectrum and under what conditions (ex. over xxx mhz cpu freq or over zzz vcore/cache voltage) The main problem * seems * to be stabilize the cache @ freq higher than nominal: I failed to do it and can be the very cause of the system instability. Thanks in advance for any help, tip, suggestion!!! :-) Last edited by TheThing; 2 Weeks Ago at 05:51 AM.   Log in Register Full Site Top Powered by vBulletin® Copyright © 2017 vBulletin Solutions, Inc.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Computer Base tests DX12's mettle in The Division by Wayne Manion  10:47 AM on December 19, 2016 Microsoft's DirectX 12 API gets more popular every day. The latest AAA title to add support for Redmond's low-level graphics API is Ubisoft's The Division. German hardware site Computer Base took some time over the weekend to run some performance analysis comparing different combinations of DX11 or DX12, Intel Core i7-6700K and AMD FX-8370 CPUs, and four different graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD. Roughly put, the results show that performance in The Division with DX12 is improved with all hardware combinations except for the Intel Core i7-6700K with Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1060. The biggest gain was the 13% increase shown by the Intel CPU with the GTX 1080. The AMD Fury X and RX 480 enjoyed improvements of four to nine percent regardless of CPU choice. The biggest changes in performance were at the 1920 x 1080 resolution, with deltas shrinking as the resolution went up. Some of the measured performance boosts were within the margin of error, though, like as the one-percent increase shown for the FX-8370 with the GTX 1060. Computer Base has more graphs, including some frametime charts, as well as additional commentary on their findings, auf Deutsch, of course. We are living in the 21st century and online translation tools do a pretty good job these days, so go take a look.

AMD MxGPU Virtualization For The AMDGPU Driver Written by Michael Larabel in AMD on 18 December 2016 at 07:38 AM EST. 17 Comments Well this weekend is exciting for AMDGPU users and open-source AMD fans. Yesterday was the news we published about Valve looking to improve AMDGPU/RADV for their Vulkan-based VR experience while the latest is work from AMD that implements GPU virtualization support within the AMDGPU driver. NVIDIA has been working on their own vGPU support for their binary driver, Intel's GVT is coming together in mainline, and now AMD has joined the party with publishing some patches for their DRM driver. The patches by AMD's Xiangliang Yu work to implement CSA and KIQ along with mailbox communication with the GPU hypervisor. CSA is the Context Save Area. KIQ in this context is the Kernel Interface Queue, as described in one of the patches, "KIQ is queue-memory based initialization method: setup KIQ queue firstly, then send command to KIQ to setup other queues, without accessing registers. For virtualization, need KIQ to access virtual function registers when running on guest mode." This AMD GPU virtualization support is initially implemented for Tonga and Fiji hardware. This AMD virtualization code is for implementing their virtualization support they advertise under the MxGPU branding. AMD announced their first hardware-virtualized GPU products at the beginning of 2016 while finally we are seeing this MxGPU support come for AMDGPU, but too late for Linux 4.10. Their MxGPU virtualization is described in more detail via this press release. The code is initially going to be disabled at compile-time via hiding behind the DRM_AMD_MXGPU Kconfig switch. The DRM_AMD_MXGPU description, "This adds AMD GPU virtualization driver and wires it up into the amdgpu drivers. User can load the driver in guest OS and run graphics applications on AMD hardware in guest mode." The 23 patches add over two thousand lines of code to the kernel and can be found for now via amd-gfx. 17 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Yet President Obama “cannot even talk about Chinese aggression.” So “Beijing now thinks it can, with impunity, do whatever it wants wherever it wants.” Conservative take: Trump Cabinet Must Fight Agencies Much is being made of the fact that many of Trump’s Cabinet picks “have key philosophical differences with the missions of the agencies they have been tapped to run,” notes David French at National Review, the fear being that “they don’t want to lead their agencies so much as [to] ‘dismantle’ them.” Says French: “Many on the left think this is a terrible thing. I think it’s fabulous.” That’s because the critics “are wrongly equating the agency’s very mission with the progressive policies they favor.” But “the Obama administration didn’t have the popular support to pass its agenda through Congress, so it went around Congress on a massive scale, including through executive actions and regulatory rulemakings.” Now that’s all “subject to repeal.” From the right: Obama’s Hypocrisy on Intel Briefings Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post takes Obama to task for his “chutzpah” in criticizing his successor for skipping his daily intelligence briefings: “This coming from the same person who skipped more than half of his daily intelligence briefings in his first term.” Indeed, “not only did Obama commit the same malpractice,” he “used the same excuses as Donald Trump to justify it”: that he was regularly briefed by his national-security team. Asks Thiessen: “So Obama could rely on other national security briefings, but Trump cannot?” As for ridicule of Trump for saying he’s “a smart person,” Obama’s NSC spokesman said his boss didn’t need briefings because he’s “among the most sophisticated consumers of intelligence on the planet.” As it happens, says Thiessen, they’re both wrong: “They do need briefers.” Professor: I Was Punished for Singing Beach Boys Tune Buck Ryan of the University of Kentucky’s First Amendment Center writes in the Lexington Herald Leader that he recently was disciplined for “sexual misconduct.” His crime? “Singing a Beach Boys tune covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks.” The tune was the classic “California Girls,” which the university’s Title IX coordinator ruled “included ‘language of a sexual nature’ and was somehow offensive.” Ryan sang the song for students at a Chinese university, using local places instead of the original American ones. “UK’s three-month investigation of my case revealed no student complaints,” but his punishment “bans me from receiving international travel funds and strips me of a prestigious award worth thousands of dollars.” And “when I inquired about my due process rights, I was told by the provost that I didn’t have any.” Business writer: Who Checks the Fact-Checkers? Leonid Bershidsky at Bloomberg is unimpressed with Facebook’s announced plan for combatting “fake news.” The site will “effectively outsource the fact-checking of news stories flagged by users as possibly fake to third-party groups” that sign “a code developed at the Poynter Institute.” But that undermines Facebook’s “own impartiality and may open the way for censorship on social networks.” For one thing, “Facebook’s choice of partner immediately cuts off a large swath of conservative readers. Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network, home to the code of principles, is funded, among other donors, by George Soros’s Open Society Foundations,” raising the issue of “partisan bias.” And many of the groups “sometimes disagree about the veracity of the same statement” — because “truth is sometimes complicated and multilayered.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under barack obama ,  beach boys ,  china ,  editorial ,  fake news ,  intelligence ,  the trump transition ,  Title IX Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next New York's never-ending asbestos racket Read Next New York's never-ending asbestos racket Most Popular This Week 1 Science says these are the men who will make you orgasm 2 Mariah Carey closes 2016 with disastrous NYE performance 3 Massive 'anomaly' lurks beneath ice in Antarctica 4 How this home intruder got what he deserved 5 Obama’s ugly bid to snub voters and tie Trump’s hands 6 Debbie Reynolds rushed to the hospital Share Selection Columnists Johnny Oleksinski Social media users have hijacked celebrity deaths for self-glorification Adam Brodsky Count on these predictions not to come true in 2017 Benny Avni Obama's hypocrisy when it comes to interference in our politics SEE ALL COLUMNISTS Editorials DC Court of Appeals' global warming decision threatens First Amendment Grading de Blasio's pivotal year Looks like it’ll be another year of campus insanity Yule Log Click here for The Post's HD Yule Log from now until the end of the year!

Data transmitted by your smart thermostat may seem harmless — but a cooler temperature could signal a house that's empty and ripe for robbery, Allen Proithis, president of Sigfox North America, told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Monday. "I think there's a will to exploit any opening," Proithis said. "So the trick is to engineer what you're doing, assuming the worst. But the other fact of the matter is, you're willing to pay a lot more for that sort of security when it's the vice president's pacemaker versus an agricultural sensor. And the trick is to match security to the threat, throughout the ecosystem." David Woolfall | Getty Images Sigfox, a secure platform for connecting so-called "internet-of-things" (IoT) devices, works sort of like a wireless carrier for everyday items. Sigfox, backed by companies like Intel and Salesforce, recently completed a funding round and has expanded rapidly worldwide over the past year, powering projects in places like Finland and Hong Kong. "This is a technology that enables the masses — the unserved market — that want to participate in the benefits of IoT, but really haven't been able to play because of the limits of technology," Proithis said. Sigfox's expansion comes after countless web cams and smart home devices, powered by Dyn, were hijacked and used to bring down major websites including Amazon, Twitter, Spotify and CNBC.com in the fall. Proithis said that many smart devices come pre-programmed with passwords like "admin" and are set to always stay connected, making them vulnerable to attacks. "The way our network works is, to get this really long battery life, 99.9 percent of the time, they're not even connected," Proithis said. "They're only really connected when they have something to say and then they go back to sleep." As it becomes more affordable, the internet of things can be incredibly useful for industries like agriculture or shipping, by finding the best time to water a plant or by tracking pallets that are lost in transit, Proithis said. Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring the advantages of a smart home. But attackers are constantly finding more ways to monetize stolen data and stay anonymous, said Scott Harrell, vice president of product management and enterprise networking at Cisco Systems, which blocks millions of cyberattacks. Harrell says connected devices like a Smart TV or MRI machine pose more of a challenge, since they may not have a traditional operating system with software security updates the way an iPhone or PC does. Cisco bought OpenDNS last year, a company that's very similar to IoT hacking victim Dyn. Domain names and IP addresses, like those used by Dyn and OpenDNS, can be used to monitor threats to connected homes, Harrell said. Despite the huge amount of threat intelligence to be gained by inspecting internet of things connections, Harrell said there's no silver bullet. "We know it's going to become a problem," Harrell said. "There is money to be made out of it. You should expect them to do it, and they will replicate it again and again."

China’s voracious appetite for the access to memory technologies (and her plans to locally produce memory chips) has yet to be satisfied. China’s memory chip production plans, although still sketchy, became evident to close industry observers in 2016. What they’ll be watching for next is who — among global suppliers like Micron, Intel, Samsung and others — will make the first move in devising and negotiating technology licensing agreements or joint ventures with China. One factor in this suspense drama are several industry players eager to minimize Samsung’s market dominance in the memory field, a few industry analysts suggested to EE Times. China, which doesn’t necessarily want to see Koreans continuing to win either, can help their cause. Rob Lineback, a senior market research analyst with IC Insights, told EE Times, “With DRAM and NAND flash being significant IC markets in China (for PCs, data center servers, tablets, and smartphones, plus a wide range of other applications), it makes sense that memory would be in the crosshairs of Chinese initiatives.” Indeed, in its 13th five-year plan, China is explicitly seeking to develop an entire semiconductor industry that includes logic, memory, analog, FPGA, power management ICs, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, CAD, and EDA tools. When DRAM, NAND Flash, NOR and other memories are thrown in together, memory occupies 25  27 percent of IC purchases in China. (Source: IC Insights) Conundrum Its memory ambitions, however, crystalize China’s dilemma. Dieter Ernst, East-West Center senior fellow, notes that the market potential for memory is huge for IoT and AI applications in transportation, health and the environment. The conundrum for China lies in “how fast and at what cost can Chinese entities gain access to core tangible [memory] technology?” EE Times sees a set of questions arising. Will China be able to design and manufacture memory chips on its own? If not, will China be able to buy out global chip companies with memory technologies? If CFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) won’t allow such M&A’s, from whom will China license cutting-edge memory technologies? Ernst raised the most crucial question: When all is said and done, “Can China bring together a pool of experienced and highly skilled engineers and technicians good enough to pull off this advanced memory invasion?” On the other hand, China isn’t facing this conundrum alone. Non-Chinese memory chip vendors are also asking themselves whether they can afford not to play ball with China. The issue isn’t just market access to China, but the immense and growing capital expenditure now so critical to memory development and production. One semiconductor company executive based in Silicon Valley, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned, “I believe companies like Micron and Toshiba are vulnerable” if they don’t find a way to work with China. Risk for overcapacity Another dimension to the memory story is this: If China delivers on its promises, the industry could face an overcapacity of flash memory in the next few years. Brian Matas, vice president responsible for market research at IC insights, cautioned in the firm’s recent report, "Overall, the flash memory segment is forecast to register the largest increase in capital spending in 2016 with a very strong 43% surge.  However, historical precedent shows that too much spending usually leads to overcapacity and pricing weakness."

Will this disrupt economic activity in just this area or will it be a wider area and for how long?," said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial. "That's the playbook by which markets have come to address these types of issues."The S&P technology index .SPLRCT rose 0.61 percent, with Microsoft, Intel, Apple and Amazon.com lifting the Nasdaq Composite to within a hair of last Tuesday's record high close.U.S. stocks have been on a tear since the Nov. 8 presidential election, with the S&P rising nearly 6 percent on bets that President-elect Donald Trump's plans for deregulation and infrastructure spending will boost the economy.The Dow Jones industrial average is less than 1 percent away from 20,000, a level it has never breached. "The Trump rally is still with us. Every time something's down for two days, people jump on it. People are looking for buying opportunities," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, some investors warn that uncertainty around Trump's policies and the uncertainty of whether they are approved by Congress pose major risks to current stock prices.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 39.65 points or 0.20 percent to end at 19,883.06.

All four provided the biggest boost to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.United Technologies (UTX.N) rose 2.12 percent, helping lift the Dow, after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to "outperform" and increased its price target. Walt Disney (DIS.N) rose 1.34 percent after its "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" movie scored the second-largest December opening in history.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 157 new highs and 38 new lows.About 6.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The S&P technology index rose 0.61 per cent, with Microsoft, Intel, Apple and Amazon.com lifting the Nasdaq Composite to within a hair of last Tuesday's record high close. US stocks have been on a tear since the Nov 8 presidential election, with the S&P rising nearly six per cent on bets that President-elect Donald Trump's plans for deregulation and infrastructure spending will boost the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average is less than one per cent away from 20,000, a level it has never breached. "The Trump rally is still with us. Every time something's down for two days, people jump on it. People are looking for buying opportunities," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, some investors warn that uncertainty around Trump's policies and the uncertainty of whether they are approved by Congress pose major risks to current stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.65 points or 0.20 per cent to end at 19,883.06. The S&P 500 ended up 4.46 points or 0.20 percent at 2,262.53 after trading as high as 2,167.47. The Nasdaq Composite added 20.28 points or 0.37 per cent to end at 5,457.44. Microsoft rose 2.12 per cent, Amazon.com gained 1.09 per cent, Intel climbed 1.60 per cent and Apple climbed 0.58 per cent. All four provided the biggest boost to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. United Technologies rose 2.12 per cent, helping lift the Dow, after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to "outperform" and increased its price target. Walt Disney rose 1.34 per cent after its "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" movie scored the second-largest December opening in history. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 157 new highs and 38 new lows. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, well below the 7.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.  - Reuters/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The drone show is being presented twice nightly at 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. through January 8 over the lagoon between Disney Springs (previously known as Downtown Disney) and Disney's Saratoga Springs hotel. Intel Corporation None Incorporating a fleet of 300 drones, Starbright Holidays marks the first show of such scale in the USA. Intel's Shooting Star drones are made of Styrofoam and plastic and weigh a little more than half a pound. They are outfitted with LED lights that are capable of over 4 billion color combinations. Intel Corporation None The presentation begins with a few bars of "When You Wish Upon a Star" followed by the appearance of twinkling lights above you in the night sky.Holiday favorites such as "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" and "O Christmas Tree" play as the drones reform and light, a few at a time, into the unmistakable shape of a Christmas tree. Matt Stroshane, Disney None For Starbright Holidays' finale, the drones form a dove. With the music swelling, the sequence packs an emotional punch. David Roark, Disney None Alfredo Ayala, principal lead, research and development for Walt Disney Imagineering and one of the show's designers,says that his team originally animated the word, "peace," but later removed it. The dove, the Imagineers figured, transcends language and culture. "We have the symbol of peace," notes Ayala. "What better way to show it than from the stars themselves – from the universe?" Matt Stroshane, Disney None The Starbright show is among a number of holiday offerings at the recently expanded Disney Springs. Todd Anderson, Disney None Holiday-themed entertainment, including a dance party, carolers, and snowflake stilt walkers, is available throughout the sprawling complex. Kent Phillips, Disney None A cute Christmas Tree Trail features over a dozen bedecked trees sporting themes such as Disney villains, "Beauty and the Beast," and (of course) "Frozen."

The Notebook 9 laptops, which have 13.3- and 15-inch screens, are lightweight laptops with full HD displays. Samsung didn't share specifics of chips in the laptops, which will be unveiled by Intel at January's CES. Nonetheless, there are some things you can expect. The new laptops will be faster than older models and also have better graphics. PC makers are measuring a performance improvement of about 5 percent to 15 percent improvement in Kaby Lake performance compared to the predecessor Skylake. Integrated graphics will be able to handle video beyond 1080p resolution. The battery life provided by Notebook 9 models is about 7 hours, which isn't as high as others in its class. The laptops have up to 256GB of storage, 720p webcams and 802.11ac wireless. The 13.3-inch model can have up to 16GB of memory, while the 15-inch model has 8GB of memory soldered on the board. The 13.3-inch Notebook 9 weighs 816 grams, while the 15-inch model weighs 984 grams. That's even lighter than the Dell XPS 13, which weighs about 1.2 kilograms. The port options include two USB 3.0, one USB-C, HDMI and MicroSD. The 15-inch model also has one USB 2.0 port. The laptop pricing wasn't immediately available.

All three major U.S. indexes ended higher but lost some steam after German police said a truck ran into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing nine people and injuring up to 50 others. That rattled U.S. investors already eyeing potential global troubles after the Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot dead in Ankara. "Markets want to be sure whether this is an isolated incident. Will this disrupt economic activity in just this area or will it be a wider area and for how long?," said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial.

The Notebook 9 laptops, which have 13.3- and 15-inch screens, are lightweight laptops with full HD displays. Samsung didn't share specifics of chips in the laptops, which will be unveiled by Intel at January's CES. Nonetheless, there are some things you can expect. The new laptops will be faster than older models and also have better graphics. PC makers are measuring a performance improvement of about 5 percent to 15 percent improvement in Kaby Lake performance compared to the predecessor Skylake. Integrated graphics will be able to handle video beyond 1080p resolution. The battery life provided by Notebook 9 models is about 7 hours, which isn't as high as others in its class. The laptops have up to 256GB of storage, 720p webcams and 802.11ac wireless. The 13.3-inch model can have up to 16GB of memory, while the 15-inch model has 8GB of memory soldered on the board. The 13.3-inch Notebook 9 weighs 816 grams, while the 15-inch model weighs 984 grams. That's even lighter than the Dell XPS 13, which weighs about 1.2 kilograms. The port options include two USB 3.0, one USB-C, HDMI and MicroSD. The 15-inch model also has one USB 2.0 port. The laptop pricing wasn't immediately available.

I read in the manual that SATA 0-1 will be disabled only if M.2 SSD is in SATA mode. The chipset has 20 PCIe lanes. I found this information about the chipset lanes allocation: - Secondary x16 slot (x4) - Two x1 slots (x2) - M.2 slot (x4) - Gigabit LAN (x1) - PCI bridge (x1) but it says nothing about SATA. Do SATA ports use PCIe lanes? I am still not sure what combinations of SATA+M.2+PCIe population are allowed/disallowed...     fleggy View Public Profile Find all posts by fleggy   (#4) wheeljack12 Master Guru     Videocard: zotac gtx 1060 6gb mini Processor: intel i7-6700k Mainboard: gb z170 gaming k3 rev 1.0 Memory: 16gb ddr4 3200mhz Soundcard: creative sbzx,Z506 5.1 PSU: Antec 80pp 750 watt 12-24-2016, 09:42 | posts: 281 | Location: Hamilton,Ontario,Canada your manual ( i know mine does) usually has a graph showing when a m.2 is installed which ports are disabled.     wheeljack12 View Public Profile Find all posts by wheeljack12     (#5) fleggy Member Guru   Videocard: Titan X Processor: i7 6700K Mainboard: Asus MAXIMUS VIII Ranger Memory: 32 GB Soundcard: SoundBlaster Zx PSU: Corsair HX850 12-26-2016, 08:08 | posts: 76 My manual does not contain any information about PCIe lanes allocation/distribution. On the other hand it shows how PCIE_slots are shared (not possible to use them all at once) so I am beginning to think that M.2 (nvme) cannot make more limitation because then PCIE slots would be unusable at all. EDIT: I know that SATA1-2 will be disabled if M.2 is in SATA mode. But I have no exact information about nvme mode.

Today, the company announced a refresh of its Notebook 9 range, featuring Intel's new 7th-generation ('Kaby Lake') processors. Like its predecessor, the new Notebook 9 comes in two sizes: a 15-inch model; and a 13.3-inch variant, which Samsung claims is "the lightest notebook on the market", weighing in at 1.8 pounds (around 814 grams). Both versions offer Full HD (1920x1080px) screens with HDR support, and "an ultra-slim bezel and near edge-to-edge display". Both models include a USB Type-C port, as well as supporting 'Adaptive Fast Charge', which the company says will allow users to fully charge either model in 80 minutes. Samsung says that you can expect around 7 hours of usage from a single charge. Along with a backlit keyboard, you'll also get an integrated fingerprint sensor with Windows Hello biometric authentication support, but there's no support for the facial recognition offered on some other high-end Windows 10 notebooks. You can view the full list of specs for both Notebook 9 models in the table below: Features 15-inch 13.3-inch Operating system Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Processor 7th-gen Intel Core i7 7th-gen Intel Core i5/i7 Display 15.0″, 350nit, FHD (1920x1080), 178°, LR, sRGB 95% Delta E<2.5, Outdoor mode (500 nits), Video HDR 13.3”, 350nit, FHD (1920x1080), 178°, LR, sRGB 95% Delta E<2.5, Outdoor mode (500 nits), Video HDR Graphics Shared Shared Storage PCIe NVMe, up to 256GB SSD SATA3 SSD, up to 256GB SSD Memory DDR4 dual channel, up to 8GB (on board) DDR4 dual channel, up to 8GB for i3, up to 16GB for i7 (on board) Wireless 802.11 ac 2X2 802.11 ac 2X2 Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.1 Bluetooth 4.1 Sound 1.5W x 2 speakers 1.5W x 2 speakers Camera 720p 720p Microphone Internal Dual Array Digital Mic Internal Dual Array Digital Mic Keyboard 1.5mm stroke, backlit, curved keycap, fingerprint sensor 1.5mm stroke, backlit, curved keycap, fingerprint sensor Ports 2 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x USB-C, HDMI, microSD, HP/Mic 2 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB-C, HDMI, MicroSD, HP/Mic AC adapter 45W small adaptor 45W small adaptor Dimensions 347.9 x 229.4 x 14.9mm 309.4 x 208 x 13.9mm Weight 2.17lbs (around 984g) 1.8lbs (around 816g) Battery 30Wh, Fast Charging, External Battery Charging 30Wh, Fast Charging, External Battery Charging Color Light Titan Light Titan Software Wi-Fi Transfer, Simple Sharing, PC Message, PC Gallery, SideSync Wi-Fi Transfer, Simple Sharing, PC Message, PC Gallery, SideSync Samsung hasn't yet announced pricing for the new Notebook 9 models, nor has it said when or where they'll be available to buy - but we should find out more about that at CES next month.

Skip to main content Advertisement Home Topics Automotive Cloud Computing Design & Development E-Commerce ERP Economics Energy Global IoT Labor Operations Purchasing Quality Control Regulatory Software Supply Chain Technology Watch Manufacturing Minute Search Social Facebook Twitter Companies Learn Login Register Subscribe Channels MNET CHEM FM ID IMPO PP Advertisement Advertisement Yahoo's Big Breach Helps Usher In An Age Of Hacker Anxiety 2 weeks 3 days ago Comments by Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company's announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. "The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise," said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. GOVERNMENT ATTACKERS Of course, it's not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. "Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. "We're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments." Yahoo's security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. TWO HACKS, MORE THAN A BILLION ACCOUNTS Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. QUESTIONS FOR VERIZON News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the "new development before reaching any final conclusions." Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses "definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price," Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. "We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon," the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack. ___ AP technology writer Bree Fowler contributed to this article from New York.

Page 1 of 7. 21 Comments With 2016 soon drawing to an end, it's time for all of my year-end recaps now of Linux drivers that I have been doing for the past 12 years. Today are benchmarks of a wide assortment of AMD graphics cards on both R600g and RadeonSI Gallium3D drivers when using Mesa 13.1-dev + LLVM 4.0 SVN and the Linux 4.9 kernel for providing a bleeding-edge look at the open-source AMD Linux graphics performance across hardware going from the Radeon HD 4890 series all the way up through the RX 480 and R9 Fury hardware. Here's a fun look at the OpenGL driver performance across this range of GPUs. This comparison wouldn't be possible with Radeon Software / AMDGPU-PRO, but thanks to the open-source driver stack not going legacy and continuing to work fine on the latest mainline kernels and xorg-server releases, it's still possible to compare the OpenGL performance of the HD 4890 to say the RX Polaris cards. AMD developers rarely touch this old hardware support these days, but the code remains open as part of the mainline Linux kernel and Mesa trees with any open-source developers free to contribute to them. All tests were done atop Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 when using the Linux 4.9.0 kernel and Mesa 13.1-dev via the Padoka PPA as of this week. But before getting to the performance numbers, it's worth mentioning some of the driver improvements over the course of 2016. In 2016, RadeonSI (along with Intel i965) finally hit OpenGL 4.5 compliance! They jumped ahead greatly with their OpenGL 4 support this year plus support for other GL extensions not yet part of a released version. Now at the end of 2016, most new Linux games are running with RadeonSI Gallium3D without problems -- aside from some games still being plagued by performance issues until RadeonSI has an OpenGL shader cache and various other optimizations. This year in Mesa there have also been a number of OpenGL performance optimizations, there was launch-day Radeon RX 480 Polaris support, experimental GCN 1.0 support for AMDGPU, and a wealth of other improvements to the open-source AMD Linux driver stack that I've written about in dozens of Phoronix articles over the course of 2016. But on the down side, unfortunately this year didn't see the merging of DAL/DC code for providing HDMI 2.0, HDMI/DP audio, and other display features. As mentioned already there also still isn't an OpenGL shader cache for RadeonSI, the open-source OpenCL stack is still in poor shape until ROCm is further along, and for select workloads the AMDGPU-PRO driver remains faster. Also unfortunate is that AMD hasn't yet open-sourced their Vulkan driver, leading to the the separate RADV driver effort by the community. The Radeon cards I had available for testing included the Radeon HD 4890, HD 5830, HD 6870, HD 6950, HD 7750, HD 7950, R7 260X, R9 270X, R9 285, R7 370, RX 460, RX 470, RX 480, and R9 Fury. On the FirePro side I was also able to test the V8750 and V8800 as additional data points. The selection of cards used for testing were all that I had available, those that were working properly (i.e. having to leave out the Radeon R9 290), and the cards that weren't busy in rack-mounted systems. All of them that were available for testing but then needing to cut off the testing with the Radeon HD 4890 as the HD 4850/4870 weren't running stable in some of these modern OpenGL tests.

Twitter Facebook ARM tackles server compatibility issues with Allinea acquisition Software compatibility has been a big problem for ARM adoption in servers and supercomputers, but the acquisition may help Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 17 December, 2016 03:44 - - - - print email Comments ARM has a big problem -- it rules in smartphones and tablets but hasn't broken into servers and supercomputers. ARM servers are devalued partly because many applications don't work with the chips. But ARM has acquired Allinea Software with the hope of partially resolving the compatibility issue. Allinea provides software development, debugging, and porting tools, which should make it easier for people to write applications for ARM-based servers and supercomputers. The acquisition will "provide a channel to thousands of developers using supercomputers and give us better first-hand knowledge of the issues being addressed as software is ported to new ARM-based systems," Javier Orensanz, general manager of the development solutions group at ARM, said in a blog entry. The development tools will also be used for ARM chips in deep-learning systems, which require large-scale server deployments for analytics. ARM's competition will come from deep-learning and HPC software tools offered by Intel, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and more recently, AMD. ARM designs chips and licenses them to third-party chipmakers like Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel. The company is aggressively chasing markets like supercomputing and IoT and is in the process of being acquired by Softbank for US$32.4 billion. Fujitsu is making the first ARM-based supercomputer called Post-K, scheduled to be deployed in Japan by 2020. The supercomputer will have 64-bit chips based on a new microarchitecture called ARMv8-A Scalable Vector Extension, which has vector processing abilities for complex calculations. With the Allinea deal, ARM realized its software weakness and is acting on it. It is acquiring customers and a shortcut to get more developers to write applications for ARM processors. Allinea tools are used by many organizations with some of the fastest computers in the world using other chip architectures. Allinea's team will become a part of the ARM's HPC development solutions team. ARM's acquisition won't affect Allinea's product roadmap. ARM did not reveal how much it paid for Allinea Software.

Not this time. Hillary Clinton's victory in the popular — but not the electoral — vote and uncertainty about Donald Trump have generated unusual interest in an event that is usually a political footnote. Under the Constitution and federal law, the real presidential election takes place this year on Dec. 19, when presidential electors meet in the 50 state capitols and Washington, DC. As the electors vote, many say they have been besieged by phone calls and e-mails. One already elector resigned. Another said he won't vote as his state did. And electors in three states went to court seeking authority to vote as they please. Related: Drama-Filled Electoral College Vote a Fitting Ending to 2016 Election Meanwhile, a petition targeting "conscientious electors" has nearly 5 million signatures. Martin Sheen, who played a president on The West Wing, and a cadre of other actors have a YouTube appeal to electors asking them give them to Hillary Clinton or anyone else other than Donald Trump. Filmmaker Michael Moore published an impassioned plea to the Electoral College's GOP members "to vote your conscience" and has vowed to pay the fines of electors who are penalized by their states for not keeping the pledge to vote for Trump.

As Arizonans went to the polls Nov. 8, 49 percent of them may have thought they were voting for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, but they actually elected Bruce Ash, Walter Begay, and 10 other people.

It takes 270 votes to win because the 12th Amendment requires a candidate to get a majority. As the president of the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden will preside over the joint session and announce the results. It sometimes happens that a vice president ends up announcing his own defeat. It happened to Richard Nixon in 1960, reading the votes for John F. Kennedy, and most recently to Al Gore in 2000, declaring the votes for George W. Bush. This year, members of a group calling itself The Electors Trust, including Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, say they've been contacted by dozens of electors seeking legal advice. Many are asking, must they vote as their states did? Related: Why We Have the Electoral College A total of 29 states have laws that bind the electors, requiring them to cast their votes for whichever candidate won that state's popular vote. But the laws are weak, providing only nominal penalties. The Supreme Court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote. But the justices have never said whether it is constitutional to enforce those pledges. Courts in Colorado and Washington state have rejected pleas from electors to be released from requirements to vote as their states did, although the electors in Colorado appealed the lower court ruling, according to The Associated Press. The state Supreme Court will have until Monday at noon, when electors cast their ballots, to decide. In California, a federal judge held a hearing on Friday morning on a similar request from an elector, Vinzenz Koller, who said he cannot vote for Hillary Clinton. Elsewhere, Christopher Suprun, a Texas paramedic, said he will not vote for the candidate who won his state's election. "Donald Trump lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief," he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. Another Republican elector from Texas, Art Sisneros, resigned in late November. A vote for Trump "would bring dishonor to God," he said. Eighteen actors and other artists, including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing, urged Republican electors in a video that went viral to "go down in the books as an American hero" and vote for anyone other than Trump. In a letter to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, 68 presidential electors from 17 states asked for a briefing on why the U.S. believes Russia was behind cyberattacks intended to influence the election. However the intelligence community said it will not discuss the Russian hacks until a review ordered by President Obama is completed in January. On Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said they won't brief Electors or Congress until the review is done. Related: U.S. Officials: Putin Personally Involved in U.S. Election Hack While the electors are generating an usual amount of attention, it is unlikely to have much effect. Republican officials say party lawyers have been in contact with the 306 Republican electors and believe only a few may vote for someone other than Donald Trump. A survey by the AP reached a similar result. After interviewing 330 of the 538 electors, the AP found "widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the hustle of anti-Trump maneuvering can derail him." Asked during a Friday news conference about the fairness of the electoral college, President Obama stopped short of saying it should be phased out but called the system "a vestige, or a carryover, from an earlier vision of how our federal government was going to work." "There are some structures in our political system as envisioned by the Founders that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats," he said.

Stock Could Rise A few near-term tailwinds might lift InvenSense, but do the risks outweigh the rewards? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Dec 18, 2016 at 7:04PM InvenSense (NYSE:INVN), the chipmaker best known for supplying motion sensors for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones and other devices, has had a wild year. The stock had fallen about 30% for the year at the beginning of December due to its slowing sales growth and competition from bigger rivals like STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and Bosch Sensortech. But then InvenSense abruptly rallied nearly 30% on Dec. 9 after Reuters reported that Japanese electronics maker TDK had offered to acquire it for $12 per share. Following that pop, InvenSense stock is now up 6% for the year, but remains almost 60% below its peak of $26 in 2014. Should investors hold on and expect the stock to rise further, or has the TDK report given long-suffering investors the best chance to cut their losses? Let's take a look at three tailwinds for InvenSense and whether they're actually good reasons to buy the stock. Image source: InvenSense. 1. A potential bidding war InvenSense posted double-digit year-over-year revenue declines over the past two quarters, and analysts expect its sales to fall 30% for the full year. Most of that decline was caused by a global slowdown in smartphone and tablet sales, its overwhelming dependence on Apple's orders (53% of its revenue in the first half of fiscal 2017), and competition from rival sensor makers like STMicro. Its bottom line also dipped into the red over the past three quarters due to rising operating expenses. Faced with those bleak numbers, the best-case scenario for InvenSense would be to sell itself before its market value declines even further. Back in October, Reuters reported that InvenSense was exploring strategic initiatives "including a possible sale," although no potential suitors were named.Then on Dec. 9 came the Reuters report that "people familiar with the matter" were saying TDK was in talks to acquire Invensense. In a previous article, I noted that STMicro, Sony (NYSE: SNE), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) could all benefit from buying InvenSense, which has a pretty low enterprise value of $900 million. If any of those companies step up to challenge TDK's rumored bid, a bidding war could give InvenSense's stock price a big boost. Though it isn't smart to invest in a stock based on the possibility of a bidding war. 2. Virtual and augmented reality Sixty-eight percent of InvenSense's revenue came from smartphones and tablets in the first half of the year. Revenues from that segment fell 35% annually during that period. To diversify away from that saturated market, InvenSense is expanding into virtual reality and augmented reality devices. Its motion sensors already power HTC's Vive VR headset, which could encourage other new headset vendors to use its gyroscopes and accelerometers. Piper Jaffray claims that 500 million VR headsets could be sold by 2025 -- indicating that it could become a growing adjacent market for InvenSense. CEO Behrooz Abdi has also claimed that a new generation of AR games like Pokemon Go could broaden its total addressable market for high-performance motion sensors in "mid-tier and low-tier smartphone markets." HTC's Vive. Image source: HTC. Those new growth markets sound promising, but investors should note that InvenSense isn't the only motion sensor maker targeting these markets. Bosch already provides motion sensors in the Oculus Rift, and STMicro's motion sensors are found in plenty of smartphones and tablets. 3. The Internet of Things In my opinion, a better growth opportunity for InvenSense would be the growing Internet of Things (IoT) market, which consists of wearables, home automation devices, connected cars, drones, and other gadgets. Intel estimates that the number of connected devices worldwide could surge from 15 billion in 2015 to 200 billion by 2020. InvenSense has been expanding into the IoT market with motion sensors for drones and connected cars via dash cams, smart mirrors, and collision avoidance systems. Revenue from InvenSense's "IoT and other" unit fell 6% annually and accounted for 23% of its top line during the first half of the year. That growth looks poor, but it's faring much better than its core smartphone and tablets business. Therefore, if InvenSense invests more heavily in its IoT business, the unit could grow again and offset its weaknesses in the mobile market. But do those potential tailwinds make InvenSense stock worth buying? Buyout buzz and expansion into new markets might boost investor interest in InvenSense, but I still don't think the stock is a worthy investment. The stock could quickly collapse if TDK walks away from the rumored talks, Apple splits its motion sensor orders with a rival chipmaker, or STMicro and Bosch leverage their scale to undercut InvenSense's prices. I believe that those risks still make InvenSense a poor investment for long-term investors. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

But since his victory in November, there has been a push to somehow give that win to Hillary Clinton. Caroline Connolly reports. (Published Sunday, Dec. 18, 2016) On Monday, December 19, members of the Electoral College are expected to select Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. But since his victory in November, there has been a push to somehow give that win to Hillary Clinton. “She will not have enough electors to win,” said Paul Yorkis, one of eleven electors in Massachusetts. Trump Feud Over Russia Intel Raises Deeper Concerns: Experts Yorkis has always intended to vote for Clinton, but that hasn’t quelled concerns from people who are still opposed to a Trump presidency. Across the country, the 538 electors in the college have received emails, letters and phone calls from voters who are hoping to convince members to prevent Trump from taking office. While only one Republican elector in Texas has indicated he won’t vote Trump, the effort to stop the president-elect has only grown in recent weeks. “I think that folks are nervous, still surprised, still maybe a little shocked from the election results last month. They’re confused, angry and looking for solutions,” explained state elector, Jason Palitsch. Because Clinton won the popular vote, many have called for an end to the Electoral College. But Rep. Shawn Dooley, R-Norfolk, said there is another route for Massachusetts. Within the last couple weeks, Dooley filed a bill proposing the state adopt a model similar to Maine. Under the plan, the state’s nine congressional districts would each receive one elector who is required to vote for the district’s chosen candidate. There would also be two at-large electors who would follow the popular vote. “We are taken for granted by the Democratic Party and we are written off by the Republican Party,” Dooley explained, “If all of a sudden one or two districts are in play, both the Democrats and the Republicans would be coming, talking to Massachusetts voters.” Similar proposals have failed at the legislature in the past, but Dooley hopes the increased attention on the issue leads to further consideration. Massachusetts electors will cast their votes at the State House on Monday at 3:00 p.m. Published at 10:25 PM EST on Dec 18, 2016 | Updated at 10:28 PM EST on Dec 18, 2016 Get the latest from necn anywhere, anytime Download the App Available for IOS and Android Follow necn Leave Comments Consumer TV Listings News Weather Investigations Politics Business Entertainment Sports Traffic Contact Us Connect With Us FCC Independent Programming Report FCC News and Information Programming Report NBC Non-Profit News Partnership Reports Send Feedback Terms of service Privacy policy © 2017 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.

By Evan Koblentz | December 18, 2016, 8:36 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/nevarpp The fight against ransomware continues, but it's unclear how much progress is being made. Ransomware is the security insider's term for remote computer hijacking where files are encrypted until money is paid. IBM said this week that nearly a third of respondents in its recent industry survey still aren't familiar with the term, even though ransomware malware began spreading through floppy disks as early as 1989. "Seventy percent of businesses that were hit by ransomware actually ended up paying. That surprised me because I would expect businesses to have backups," said Limor Kessem, an IBM security expert who authored the report. Businesses are most likely to pay the ransom for financial data in the range of $10,000 to $50,000, she added. Not even backup data is foolproof, Kessem observed. Sometimes backup data is encrypted by the malware, it's too old to contain recent important data, or it would simply take longer to restore than the business could wait, she noted. SEE: Cybersecurity ebook: The ransomware battle (Tech Pro Research) Amazon, Europol, Intel, and Kaspersky Lab collaborate on an online ransomware decryption project called No More Ransom; Bitdefender, Check Point, Emsisoft, and Trend Micro recently joined them. But there are occasions when making an electronic ransom payment is poor decision making, not necessarily poor technology execution. "Companies don't always have an incident response plan in place. They don't always practice and prepare for this scenario," Kessem said. IBM subsidiary Resilient Systems released a program called Dynamic Playbook to help companies with such planning. More about IT Security Video: 5 things to know about ethical hacking Five ways to maintain your privacy on your smartphone, no downloads required Firms that force you to change your password are clueless says cyber security chief Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter Kessem, in her report, also noted: "According to U.S. government statistics, ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016, with an average of 4,000 attacks per day. The [Federal Bureau of Investigation] reported that in just the first three months of 2016, more than $209 million in ransomware payments have been made in the United States—a dramatic 771 percent increase over a reported $24 million for the whole of 2015. The FBI estimates ransomware is on pace to be a $1 billion dollar source of income for cybercriminals this year." The FBI urges ransomware victims to report the crime. "While ransomware infection statistics are often highlighted in the media and by computer security companies, it has been challenging for the FBI to ascertain the true number of ransomware victims as many infections go unreported to law enforcement," the bureau said in a report this fall. "Victims may not report to law enforcement for a number of reasons, including concerns over not knowing where and to whom to report; not feeling their loss warrants law enforcement attention; concerns over privacy, business reputation, or regulatory data breach reporting requirements; or embarrassment. Additionally, those who resolve the issue internally either by paying the ransom or by restoring their files from back-ups may not feel a need to contact law enforcement." Moreover, the FBI noted, there's no guarantee that ransomware thieves will return your data after you pay. Much like Kevin Mitnick's perspective on phishing, any individual or company can become a ransomware victim and have no choice. But has it ever happened at Big Blue? "I am glad to say no," Kessem said. "Not that we are aware of," another IBMer emphasized. For more IT security news, analysis, and tips, subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

It’s now come to light that Xiaomi is gearing up to launch an updated version of that device on 23 December. The current Mi Notebook Air offers an Intel i5 6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, an Nvidia 940MX graphics card and 256GB of storage with a 13.3 inch Full HD screen. All of this is available at around Rs 50,000 in China, which is almost Rs 20,000-30,000 less than anything that the competition has to offer. It was already a great deal. However, Gizmochina reports that they’ve received an invite to a Mi Notebook Air event scheduled for 23 December. The invite bears an image of a Mi Notebook Air, but the keen-eyed observer will note the presence of a network connectivity indicator on the laptop’s display. This probably means that the laptop will launch with integrated support for 4G SIMs. We can’t think of anything else that Xiaomi needs to update, however. We expect that there is indeed a hardware upgrade, the new device will come with Intel’s current, seventh-generation Kaby Lake architecture.

Ireland has a thriving start-up community that is getting stronger every year. We selected this year’s crop of ones to watch on the basis of recent achievements such as funding as well as industry recognition and most importantly, technological relevance. The 30 start-ups that follow straddle the whole gamut of technology including wearables, internet of things (IoT), mobility, robotics, e-commerce, cleantech, apps, hardware and data management, to name just a few.

According to Shackleton: “When it comes to delivering notifications for users, every app does push in the same way as it was invented for email. We think that is crazy.” Invizbox From left: Vincent Riou, Paul and Elizabeth Canavan and Chris Monks of Invizbox.

To do this, WeSavvy integrates with another growing tech sector, mobile health.

Cortechs uses this platform to create games, dashboards, and collect brainwave data so children can improve their behaviour and build a more resilient mind. “Cortechs’ opportunity is selling to the half million UK/Ireland market with attention deficit issues worth around €60m that can scale to €600m when pushed out to the European and US markets and to a further €1.2bn if we move both vertically into the adult market,” Behan explained. MamaBud Sarah Martin, founder and CEO of Mama Bud. Image: Luke Maxwell MamaBud is an Irish e-commerce and logistics company selling Irish-sourced baby foods directly to homes in China.

MamaBud aims to fill the gap with quality and safe produce sourced in Ireland. “MamaBud is a legitimised, encrypted version of this grey market, delivering premium products direct to Chinese mothers, and perfectly poised to scoop up that value,” said CEO and founder Sarah Martin. FXCH Dublin-based start-up Foreign Exchange Clearing House (FXCH) is turning to crowdfunding to raise €8.5m, to expand its operation that uses blockchain and overhaul how currency is exchanged between financial institutions. The founders have worked together for over 20 years, beginning in the FX futures markets when the NYBOT-FINEX set up shop in Dublin in in 1995. Their experience in futures is where the central clearing concept took shape. A few attempts were made to partner with established exchanges to offer a Cleared Spot-FX service. But for budget reasons or just cultural differences, it never took off. “When we traded on the futures pits in France many years ago, we did not realise how advanced the central counterparty model was, the hidden gem behind the exchange’s open outcry system,” said Marc Despallieres, director of APAC at FXCH. “What we are bringing to the OTC world of Spot-FX with FXCH is this streamlined simplicity of a clearing house. Our usage of the blockchain reinforces that simplicity with transparency.” Gigliotti Fiona Levie, CEO of Gigliotti.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 19, 2016December 19, 2016 by Monika Donimirska 3 Reasons InvenSense, Inc. Stock Could Rise InvenSense (NYSE: INVN) , the chipmaker best known for supplying motion sensors for Apple ‘s(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones and other devices, has had a wild year. The stock had fallen about 30% for the year at the beginning of December due to its slowing sales growth and competition from bigger rivals like STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) and Bosch Sensortech. But then InvenSense abruptly rallied nearly 30% on Dec. 9 after Reuters reported that Japanese electronics maker TDK had offered to acquire it for $12 per share. Following that pop, InvenSense stock is now up 6% for the year, but remains almost 60% below its peak of $26 in 2014. Should investors hold on and expect the stock to rise further, or has the TDK report given long-suffering investors the best chance to cut their losses? Let’s take a look at three tailwinds for InvenSense and whether they’re actually good reasons to buy the stock. Image source: InvenSense. 1. A potential bidding war InvenSense posted double-digit year-over-year revenue declines over the past two quarters, and analysts expect its sales to fall  30% for the full year. Most of that decline was caused by a global slowdown in smartphone and tablet sales, its overwhelming dependence on Apple’s orders (53% of its revenue in the  first half of fiscal 2017), and competition from rival sensor makers like STMicro. Its bottom line also dipped into the red over the past three quarters due to rising operating expenses. Faced with those bleak numbers, the best-case scenario for InvenSense would be to sell itself before its market value declines even further. Back in October, Reuters reported that InvenSense was exploring strategic initiatives “including a possible sale,” although no potential suitors were named.Then on Dec. 9 came the Reuters report that “people familiar with the matter” were saying TDK was in talks to acquire Invensense. In a previous article , I noted that STMicro, Sony (NYSE: SNE) , and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) could all benefit from buying InvenSense, which has a pretty low enterprise value of $900 million. If any of those companies step up to challenge TDK’s rumored bid, a bidding war could give InvenSense’s stock price a big boost. Though it isn’t smart to invest in a stock based on the possibility of a bidding war. 2. Virtual and augmented reality Sixty-eight percent of InvenSense’s revenue came from smartphones and tablets in the first half of the year. Revenues from that segment fell 35% annually during that period. To diversify away from that saturated market, InvenSense is expanding into virtual reality and augmented reality devices. Its motion sensors already power HTC ‘s Vive VR headset, which could encourage other new headset vendors to use its gyroscopes and accelerometers. Piper Jaffray claims that  500 million VR headsets could be sold by 2025 — indicating that it could become a growing adjacent market for InvenSense. CEO Behrooz Abdi has also claimed that a new generation of AR games  like Pokemon Go could broaden its total addressable market for high-performance motion sensors in “mid-tier and low-tier smartphone markets.” HTC’s Vive. Image source: HTC. Those new growth markets sound promising, but investors should note that InvenSense isn’t the only motion sensor maker targeting these markets. Bosch already provides motion sensors in the  Oculus Rift, and STMicro’s motion sensors are found in plenty of  smartphones and tablets. 3. The Internet of Things In my opinion, a better growth opportunity for InvenSense would be the growing Internet of Things (IoT) market, which consists of wearables, home automation devices, connected cars, drones, and other gadgets. Intel estimates that the number of connected devices worldwide could surge from 15 billion in 2015 to 200 billion by  2020. InvenSense has been expanding into the IoT market with motion sensors for drones and connected cars via dash cams, smart mirrors, and collision avoidance systems. Revenue from InvenSense’s “IoT and other” unit fell 6% annually and accounted for 23% of its top line during the first half of the year. That growth looks poor, but it’s faring much better than its core smartphone and tablets business. Therefore, if InvenSense invests more heavily in its IoT business, the unit could grow again and offset its weaknesses in the mobile market. But do those potential tailwinds make InvenSense stock worth buying? Buyout buzz and expansion into new markets might boost investor interest in InvenSense, but I still don’t think the stock is a worthy investment. The stock could quickly collapse if TDK walks away from the rumored talks, Apple splits its motion sensor orders with a rival chipmaker, or STMicro and Bosch leverage their scale to undercut InvenSense’s prices. I believe that those risks still make InvenSense a poor investment for long-term investors. 10 stocks we like better than InvenSense When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Linux 4.10 To Better Support Microsoft's Surface 3 Device Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 19 December 2016 at 03:00 AM EST. Add A Comment A few days ago I wrote about HID improvements for Microsoft's Surface 3/4 tablets coming with Linux 4.10 while now there is additional driver work landing to benefit the Microsoft Surface 3 2-in-1 computer. The Microsoft Surface 3 with Linux 4.10 now has button and lid driver support as the latest additions. Intel's Darren Hart sent in the button and lid support for the Surface 3 as part of a secondary platform-drivers-x86 update for the 4.10 merge window. Other work included as part of this second platform-drivers-x86 update include a fix for the IdeaPad Y700, Mellanox platform changes, and Whiskey Core PMIC TMU support.

The deal should close in early 2017. Thundersoft makes operating systems and other platform tools for device makers. Acquiring a company like Rightware that focuses on graphical interfaces for automotive systems positions Thundersoft as a stronger offering for customers looking at end-to-end solutions. There is a clear opportunity here, since car makers are turning to outside partners like these to both provide technology but also guidance in how to navigate themselves as the car industry continues to evolve. (This has also been some of the logic driving car groups buying into mapping companies, and partnering with tech companies to build and develop new in-car systems.) Thundersoft, which was founded in 2008 and is publicly traded in China, has taken strategic backing from companies like Qualcomm and Intel. It is using the acquisition not only to build out its business in the car industry, but also to help it grow more outside of China. Rightware is its first acquisition outside of China. “The automotive market is one of the fastest growing segments for Thundersoft, and we are providing in-vehicle infotainment and cluster OS solutions to our customers worldwide,” said Larry Geng, CEO of Thundersoft, in a statement. “Cars are getting smarter — with rich applications and fully optimized OS solutions. Rightware has the best user experience design technology, which will be featured in more connected cars in the market. In combination with Rightware’s unique technology, design knowhow and world-class talent, we can bring more value to our customers and transform the automotive industry with our innovations.” Rightware — which will continue to operate as an independent company, currently employing 50 but also now hiring more — has been around since 2009 but its last round of disclosed funding was a $5 million round back in 2014, so it seems like this, in part, is one way of expanding its business in a climate where remaining a smaller independent player may have been more challenging. “Kanzi is expected to power over 25 million cars by 2022. With Thundersoft, we can expand this footprint further and support our customers even better,” said Jonas Geust, CEO of Rightware, in a statement. “We see that the specialisation within the global automotive industry software will continue. This creates a huge possibility for us to position Kanzi as the industry standard software solution. The arrangement further strengthens our presence in the growing Asian automotive market and complements our strong footprint in the European and American automotive markets.” Another notable point is that Rightware originally started out focusing on building a platform for graphic interfaces for all kinds of devices, with the emphasis on phones and tablets, before focusing on cars. This in itself is an interesting shift that speaks to the pace of change in the car world today, and how many have come to see it as a key piece of “hardware” while mobile has somewhat slowed down in growth and development as customers have consolidated essentially on two platforms, Android and iOS.  Rightware said that current management will remain and “re-invest in the company” as part of the deal. (This presumably means that they have kept a stake in the transaction at least for the initial earn out.) Existing shareholders include Finnish Industry Investment Ltd, Inventure Fund Ky, Nexit Ventures, the current management and the company founders. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Rightware Oy Founded 2009 Overview Rightware Oy provides graphical user interface solutions for in mobile, automotive, and other embedded industries worldwide.

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: Kodi 17.0 bèta 7 Door Bart van Klaveren, maandag 19 december 2016 12:09, 54 reacties • Feedback Bron: Kodi, submitter: Idiocracy De zevende en naar alle waarschijnlijkheid laatste bètaversie van Kodi 17.0 is uitgekomen. Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaardskin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. De belangrijkste veranderingen die in bèta 7 zijn doorgevoerd zijn hieronder voor je samengevat. Kodi v17 “Krypton” The last Beta 7 It’s almost Christmas and as such we wanted to bring you the last Beta version of Kodi 17. This means we have good hopes we have squashed the biggest and known issues and up next we will go to Release Candidates which in the end will result in the final release. However let’s not get ahead of ourselves and first gather some more feedback on testing this Beta 7 version. The changes for this seventh an last beta are the result of the continuous effort from the developers, either from inside the team or outside to get v17 into final release shape. We sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with answering their questions. Fixes done in this Beta 7: Update Estuary and Estouchy skin with some bugfixes Enable IEC61937 audio passthrough support on Android for DTS-HD, TrueHD, DTS:X and ATMOS in case the Android version supports this Fix PVR channel OSD display conditions Fix possible crash in PVR EPG Fix multiple selection in file browser Fix duplicate context menu for PVR recordings Fix wrong window size on OSX Fix problem on Windows that currently in use skins couldn’t be updated Further improvement of cmake build system Various other improvements and fixes A full list can be found here.

De echte fanatiekelingen die niet kunnen wachten op een nieuwe beta van Kodi (of natuurlijk de final release) kunnen tussendoor de Estuary skin updaten middels Github. Simpelweg de skin.estuary map vervangen in je program files\kodi\addons folder. (of een git pull doen met Git for Windows). [Reactie gewijzigd door FREAKJAM op 19 december 2016 12:51] Reageer +1 LessRam @FREAKJAM • 19 december 2016 17:00 Estuary geeft mij nog niet al de mogelijkheden die ik wil. Ik gebruik momenteel Titan als skin, deze geeft mega veel instellingen. Eigenlijk te veel en soms wat buggy, maar het uiteindelijke resultaat is wel zoals ik het wil. Ik ben vooral gefocust op muziek vanaf ext. harddisk, en wat minder op films. Terwijl de meeste skins vooral focussen op films. Cover art, full screen en bedieningsknoppen onderin continue (dus niet na 10/20/30 secs uit beeld), artiest info, disc info e.d. Er is niet een skin echt in gespecialiseerd. Daar tegenover zoek ik een skin die heeeeel basaal is, voor iemand anders die eigenlijk alleen maar films wil kijken vanaf harddisk, en geen muziek, youtube etc nodig heeft. Ook zo'n skin heb ik tot noch toe niet gevonden. De Titan skin helemaal uitkleden en vervolgens in demo-mode zetten is het enige dat ik kan bedenken. Reageer +1 FREAKJAM @LessRam • 19 december 2016 17:22 Ik ben zelf persoonlijk fan van Arctic Zephyr (From Ashes mod) en Aeon MQ6 (Krypton Mod). MQ7 is nog niet zo heel erg lang uit voor Jarvis, dus een Krypton-release zal nog wel even duren. Ik gebruik MQ zelf al sinds de oorspronkelijke versie, dus die krijgt altijd snel wel de voorkeur. Mimic vind ik trouwens ook wel fijn, dat is een mix van de Refocus en Arctic Zephyr skin. Probeer het een beetje uit en check het forum van Kodi eens. Lang niet alle skins staan in de official Kodi Repo. Zo heb je een mod van Estuary die bijvoorbeeld ook meer views heeft, en zo heb je ook nog een aantal Work in Progress skins. [Reactie gewijzigd door FREAKJAM op 19 december 2016 17:25] Reageer +1 Jorgen Kodi @FREAKJAM • 19 december 2016 23:09 Eminence 1 en 2 en hun mods waren ook fantastische skins. Helaas niet voor Kodi 17/18, maar wel voor 16. Er was geen enkele skin die het langer dan een paar dagen uithield bij mij; ik keerde altijd terug naar Confluence. Tot ik Eminence tegenkwam. Fantastische skin en een geweldige mod. Reageer +1 FREAKJAM @Jorgen • 19 december 2016 23:15 De Github versie van Eminence 2.0 is Krypton compatible. Volgende week verwacht de dev dat het geupdate zal worden in de Kodi repo. (Ik gok met nog wat fixxes). Ik heb de skins van deze skinner (jurialmunkey) ook altijd super gevonden. Tijdje terug de beste man ook wat "biertjes" gedoneerd als dank. Reageer +1 Jorgen Kodi @FREAKJAM • 20 december 2016 00:06 Wat het mooie is van jurialmunkey en Guilouz (dev van de mod) is dat ze altijd heel erg open hebben gestaan richting hun gebruikers qua suggesties implementeren en bugfixes oplossen. Hun topics waren altijd erg actief, zowel van meedenkende gebruikers als van de beide devs zelf. Ik denk dat ik voor Kodi 17 eerst Estuary mod van Guilouz ga proberen, maar als die niet bevalt dat ik dan jurialmunkey's Eminence erop gooi. Bedankt voor de tip. Reageer +2 devil-strike 19 december 2016 12:18 10 bit hevc geldt alleen voor windows, onder Linux werkt het nog niet(ffmpeg moet dit nog inbouwen), alhoewel gister de eerste libreelec uitgekomen is met experimental hardware hevc 10bit support. libreelec http://forum.kodi.tv/show...62&pid=2481006#pid2481006 met ffmpeg hevc 10bit support(experimental) Let wel op de libreelec versie met 10bit hevc maakt gebruik van early alpha versie kodi18. [Reactie gewijzigd door devil-strike op 19 december 2016 15:30] Reageer +1 Klojum Design en multimedia @devil-strike • 19 december 2016 13:21 Ten overvloede wellicht: Deze hevc-10bit versie van LibreELEC wordt gebaseerd op Kodi 18 nightly, dus niet op Kodi 17 final. Kodi 18 draait ook al op een nieuwe MyVideos108, er is dus geen compatibiliteit met Kodi 17 voor diegenen met een shared MySQL database. [Reactie gewijzigd door Klojum op 19 december 2016 13:22] Reageer +1 Pixal 19 december 2016 12:55 Ik draai al een aantal beta's op de Nvidia Shield. Sinds de laatste 2 beta's moet ik vaak de hele Shield herstarten omdat het beeld gaat haperen. Wanneer het beeld eenmaal hapert gebeurt dit ook in de Android omgeving, dus niet alleen in Kodi, maar het onstaat wel steeds in Kodi. Niemand anders hiermee? Reageer +1 Klojum Design en multimedia @Pixal • 19 december 2016 13:17 Ik zou gewoon wachten tot Kodi 17 final uit, zodat 'koyin' zijn ding kan doen met SPMC. Want hij is de echte Android-developer voor Kodi, en gebruikt ook een Shield TV voor de ontwikkeling van SPMC. Ik weet 't, het is lastig al dat wachten Reageer +1 Pixal @Klojum • 19 december 2016 15:38 Ja als ik een beta zie met 1 functie die ik wil hebben (zoals DTS-HD ondersteuning in Kodi 17) kijk ik al niet meer naar andere zaken. Vandaar dat ik deze beta dus ook al draai ookal was het iets te vroeg. En ondanks veel minder enthousiaste geluiden ben ik zeer blij met de nieuwe skin en wil ik niet meer terug naar 16. Reageer +1 rb338 @Pixal • 19 december 2016 12:59 Heb ik ook af en toe idd. Kodi sluiten en opnieuw starten lost het voor mij op, ik hoeft dus niet de hele Shield te herstarten. Had er met SPMC nooit last van, de laatste nightlies (van afgelopen 2 weken) zijn de eerste Krypton builds die ik draai. Vanavond eens kijken of het met beta 7 opgelost is! [Reactie gewijzigd door rb338 op 19 december 2016 13:00] Reageer +1 twaekers @Pixal • 19 december 2016 13:05 ...ik denk een nvidia probleem, na de laatste update ineens geen ondersteuning meer voor veel apps. Dit terwijl het met voorgaande firmware wel kon allemaal. Het lukt op een gegeven moment wel maar meestal dan via een force vanuit je webbrowser (google play). Erg vreemd een duister af en toe die nvidia shield TV. Beetje over-hyped allemaal. (weet iemand hoe je eenvoudig een firmaware terug kan?)

Reageer +1 boompjes 19 december 2016 13:20 Kodi ziet er goed uit! Ik ben nog steeds niet zo fan van die android boxjes. Allemaal vragen ze vrij veel handelingen om in Kodi. Hetgeen wat nog steeds echt mist is een "killer remote". De remote van de Apple TV is zo ontzettend handig in gebruik, ik wil nooit meer wat anders. Als ze dat nou eens zouden maken en Kodi meer als een OS maken en minder als een softwarepakket hebben ze een goed product.

Reageer 0 Bart_Smith @boompjes • 20 december 2016 09:25 De Nvidia Shield TV remote lijkt erg veel op die van Apple TV, ik heb ze beide en de Nvidia versie ligt beter in de hand, geen losse batterijen en opladen via USB. En Kodi als Os voor de Shield TV zou ik niet willen, dan mis ik mijn Netflix en Ziggo Go apps Reageer 0 MacPoedel @boompjes • 30 december 2016 13:31 Kodi als OS, dat zijn LibreELEC of OpenELEC, een zo kaal mogelijke Linux distributie met als enige GUI Kodi. De opzet daarvan is niet veel anders dan wat Apple doet met Apple TV. Remote, tsja een softwarepakket komt nu eenmaal niet met hardware. Kodi is in elk geval wel compatibel met afstandsbedieningen, maar welke je kunt of moet gebruiken is afhankelijk van waar je het op gebruikt. Android boxjes komen met een infrarood afstandsbediening (of Air Mouse als het toestel een gewone versie van Android draait en geen Android TV), voorbeelden van Android TV boxen met goede afstandsbedieningen zijn de Nvidia Shield TV of Xiaomi Mi Box. Draai je Kodi op een pc of Raspberry Pi dan kun je een infraroodontvanger aansluiten of bv een Logitech Harmony gebruiken. En los van het platform kun je Kodi ook altijd bedienen met apps, bv Yatse of Kore. Reageer +1 XaeonBE 19 december 2016 12:10 Bijna klaar voor RC it seems! Kan niet wachten! Reageer +1 rb338 @XaeonBE • 19 december 2016 12:28 Ik kon ook niet wachten en ben na de release van beta 6 overgestapt van SPMC 16.4 naar Kodi 17 nightly Voornamelijk omdat ik erg veel last had van sync issues tussen audio en video bij het kijken naar live TV. En gelukkig is dat opgelost! Af en toe nog wat last van crashes, maar daarvoor is het een beta. Zo te zien is de kans groot dat beta 7 een stuk stabieler is, dus ik ga hem vanavond proberen Verder heb ik geprobeerd te wennen aan Estuary, ik vind het een mooie skin maar ben toch weer terug naar Arctic:Zephyr. Dit alles op een NVidia Shield TV en een Chinees Android apparaatje... Reageer +1 CycloneCleaver @rb338 • 19 december 2016 13:23 NVidia shield, ik vind dit een mega interessant apparaat. Ik heb echter bij Kodi soms nog het probleem dat ik de melding krijg dat hij mijn bluray ISO niet kan openen. Als ik de ISO dan mount en zelf de hoofdfilm zoek, kan ik deze openen met Kodi, en dan is er niks aan de hand. Ik ben er nog niet achter gekomen of het op Android ook mogelijk is een ISO op dezelfde wijze te mounten. Iemand die hier een antwoord op heeft? Reageer +1 rb338 @CycloneCleaver • 19 december 2016 13:52 Ik heb zelf niet veel ISO's, maar de BluRay ISO die ik laatst heb geprobeerd werkt "gewoon". Ik merk alleen dat het bijna een minuut duurt voordat Kodi met de hoofdstuk keuze komt, en tot die tijd blijft alles hangen. Zodra je een hoofdstuk gekozen hebt, speelt de film prima. Menu's boeien me niet zo en heb ik nooit geprobeerd aan de praat te krijgen Mounten is dus allemaal niet van toepassing, een ISO staat in mijn bibliotheek zoals iedere andere film en wordt ook zo afgespeeld. [Reactie gewijzigd door rb338 op 19 december 2016 13:53] Reageer +1 CycloneCleaver @rb338 • 20 december 2016 05:13 Kodi ondersteund inderdaad helemaal geen menu's bij blu-ray's. Hij vraagt me gewoon wat ik wil afspelen, en daar staat dan gewoon de hoofdfilm bovenaan, dit werkt prima. Het is alleen soms wat moeilijker bij series op blu-ray, maar ook wel te doen. Het probleem is dat Kodi soms weigert de ISO te openen, en net doet of ik hem niet aanklik. Soms krijg ik ook een melding dat hij het niet kan afspelen. Als ik dat de boel zelf mount en in de mappen naar de hoofdfilm zoek en de hoofdfilm probeer af te spelen is er geen probleem. Vandaar dat ik dit vroeg! Eerst een hele ISO uitpakken om spontaan een film te kijken werkt dan niet fijn, en op Windows heb ik een work around, op android nog niet. Dat is het enige dat me tegen houdt om voor een shield te gaan! Reageer +1 wabsta 19 december 2016 12:42 Op mijn Amazon Firestick kon bij beta 6 (wellicht eerdere beta's ook) ineens geen gewone h264 mkv's meer worden afgespeeld.

De apps uit de store draaien in een sandbox. Ze hebben veel minder invloed op het systeem dan de ouderwetse applicaties. Bij het verwijderen blijft er verder niks achter en updates worden automatisch geinstalleerd. Daarnaast gebruik ik mijn HTPC voor file opslag en voor Torrex, dus een uitgekleed OS heb ik geen behoefte aan. En een halve minuut opstarttijd inclusief Kodi vind ik acceptabel.

The Samsung Notebook 9 in 13.3-inch and 15-inch variants will soon be available with Intel’s new 7th-generation processors – the Kaby Lake series.The smaller model will be available with Core i5 and Core i7 variants, while the larger 15-inch version only ships with an i7 Kaby Lake CPU. The new Notebook 9 (2017) now also comes with faster storage and memory. On the larger model, you’ll be able to get up to 8GB of of DDR4 dual-channel memory, while the 13.3-inch i7 model can be configured with up to 16GB of DDR4 dual channel RAM. And the 15-inch model comes with up to 256GB of storage – specifically, a PCIe NVMe solid state drive. As far as the display goes, both models ship with Full HD resolution screens that have a maximum brightness of 350 nits. You’ll get relatively wide 178-degree viewing angles, and a 95% sRGB colour gamut. There’s also an outdoor mode that knocks the peak brightness up to 500 nits, as well as a High Dynamic Range mode for video playback. Both laptops come equipped with two 1.5W speakers, a 720p camera, and support for various connection methods, including 802.11 ac (2x2) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. The keyboard is backlit, and features a fingerprint sensor to boot. But it’s the slick design that could woo many buyers, with Samsung flogging the 13.3-inch model at a weight of just 1.8 pounds – that’s less than 1kg, and Samsung claims it makes the Notebook 9 the lightest notebook on the market. The laptops also feature an “ultra-slim bezel” with a near edge-to-edge display. Unfortunately, it’s not clear when Samsung plans to begin selling the laptops – or at what price they’ll be available. The move could be seen as curiously timed, as we’re now so close to Christmas, and also very close to January’s CES 2017 – the annual Las Vegas technology tradeshow. It would have seemed likely that new notebooks would be announced at the show, but Samsung may still decide to showcase the laptops on site in any case.

Image: Fer Gregory In his predictions for 2017, John Kennedy forecasts how blockchain will be about more than money, IT will move to the clouds and bots will become humanity’s new best friends. Predicting the future in tech is never an easy business, mainly because tech companies are, by nature, secretive and like to have the last word. Any time I predict what Apple is up to, for example, I always end on the line: “But only Apple really knows.” Because that is simply the truth. But no one could have foreseen the events of 2016. We witnessed the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, the loss of so many stars who wrote the soundtracks to our lives, the tragic killings in Nice and the bloody endgame in Aleppo, which will always be a shame for the world to remember. Predictions for 2017 build on a crazy 2016 In tech, it was business as usual with very few real surprises; except maybe for Apple killing off the headphone jack in its iPhones; fake news infecting Facebook and allegedly influencing the US elections; Putin’s government hacking America; exploding Samsung Galaxy Note7s; hacking getting out of control, especially with ransomware and leaks to Wikileaks; Apple taking on the FBI; no one wanting to buy Twitter; Vine dying on the leaf; and mega acquisitions, such as Facebook buying LinkedIn and Verizon buying Yahoo. It all sounds like a rousing verse from R.E.M.’s It’s the End of the World as We Know It… On the home front in Ireland, the biggest news was the European Commission lobbying a €13bn tax levy against Apple to the chagrin of the latter and the Irish Government; Britain’s decision to Brexit the EU; the stalling and stalling of the National Broadband Plan; and of course, mega acquisitions such as Verizon’s decision to buy Fleetmatics for $2.4bn and Intel’s acquisition of Movidius for an alleged sum $300m. So, dear reader, what will 2017 hold for us through the tech lens? Blockchain will be about more than just payments If there was one breakthrough technology of 2016, it had to be blockchain: the enabling smart ledger technology that was fundamental to the rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and a whole slew of new fintech start-ups and platforms. But more and more experts are coming to the conclusion that blockchain technology could be very useful in ways that go beyond fintech or cryptocurrencies. The ingenious automated technology could end up being an enabling force for a panoply of platforms and uses, such as network and systems management. The key is the digital trail of crumbs: blockchain technology – which underpins emerging digital, virtual or cryptocurrencies – consists of blocks that hold timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, which form a chain with each block reinforcing those preceding it. Pay close attention to an interview I did with Seamus Cushley, PwC’s expert on blockchain who runs the company’s blockchain lab in Belfast. Cushley indicated that in the last nine months of 2016, some $1.4bn of investment went into blockchain start-ups. According to Cushley, blockchain is being investigated not only as a way to enable the viable exchange of contracts for value in everything from FX trading to property acquisitions and more, it foretells the future structure of the internet as we know it. The future of work If, like me, you witnessed the onset of the internet being heralded as a revolution in how we work, leading to all kinds of newfangled ways of working, such as teleworking, e-working or nearshoring… you were had. Our lives were meant to get easier, there would be more quality time with loved ones, more time to be creative… wrong. The digital world has created a noose that means people are working longer hours. Countries like France have even passed laws preventing employers from emailing workers after certain hours. As skills shortages rise, stress levels soar and entrepreneurship becomes more appealing to talented young executives eager to break free of the rat race, employers will be forced to reassess how they conduct relationships with workers. How do they retain talent, get the best out of enthusiastic people and ensure health levels are optimal? ‘What is the future of work?’ is a question that employers and employees alike will obsess over in 2017 and beyond. Creative companies that value human capital will examine new ways of working, pilot intrapreneurship endeavours to help sate the entrepreneurial wanderings of top talent, vent creative frustrations and ultimately find the key to a quality work/life balance. The old mantra that work should not just be a place to go, but somewhere you actually enjoy going to, might be dusted off and given a new shine. Time will tell, however, if questions of the future of work will be a meaningful cause or just more management consulting navel-gazing. Fintech goes mainstream In parallel with the arrival in Ireland of mobile wallet services like Android Pay (recently) and Apple Pay (eventually), smartphone-toting consumers are going to embrace fintech apps as a cleverer way of managing their money. Think of these apps as the Swiss Army knives of finance. Companies like Dublin and London-based Circle – which enables users to instantaneously transfer funds to friends and family via the app or by text message on the iPhone, using blockchain as a core enabler and Barclays as a licensed service provider – are at the forefront of this trend. Rather than displacing banks as some had feared, this signals a gradual move by banks to employ fintech apps on the front line as an easier and more cost-effective way to deal with consumers, while enabling them to focus on more productive, higher value work as branches become fewer. Expect banks to employ programmes to franchise fintech apps or initiate outright acquisitions in 2017. Machine learning becomes a discipline and no longer confused with AI For too long, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have been lumped into the same conversation. That is going to change in 2017, as a broader understanding of what AI is all about pervades the tech industry. Machine learning is remembering and AI is thinking, remembering, deciding and acting. Quite simply, machine learning in apps and internet services is all about improving as time goes on, learning and assimilating users’ tastes and preferences – for example, for airline travel or hotels. AI, on the other hand, powers the bots that have conversations with the users and employs machine learning as one powerful subset of a myriad of capabilities. Start-ups and established tech players that use machine learning, which I have met on the trail from Amsterdam to Lisbon in the past year, are quite clear that it is not to be confused with full AI. Beautiful bots Humankind’s friendship with bots – or automated artificial agents – will be cemented in 2017. Facebook is currently leading the charge, creating experiences where already it is hard to decipher whether you are talking to a human or a machine. This portends major changes for the future of customer relationship management, which no doubt Microsoft, Salesforce and fast-growing companies like Intercom are watching very closely. Could bots be mankind’s next best friend? Tech leaders will be the new business leaders The digital economy is the economy. Across the world in 2016, thousands of traditional businesses went to sleep one night and awoke the next day as data businesses. The trend will continue in 2017, as the internet, smartphone apps or other digital filters become the aperture through which consumers increasingly transact. You are seeing this on retail floors of stores like River Island, where consumers can shop online and collect in-store, on flights with Ryanair where the digital experience continues long after you check in or check out, and the disruption that players like Airbnb and Uber are causing traditional industries like hospitality and transport, respectively. This is signalling a major transformation in how companies deal with their customers and view their data. According to IDC, 50pc of the Global 2000 companies will be depending on digital products, services and experiences to connect with customers. By 2021, it is forecast that a third of CEOs and COOs of Global 2000 companies will have spent at least five years in a tech leadership role. Cloud will reign eternal From being a mere concept in 2008 to today, where most consumers and executives rely on the cloud consistently – from Facebook and WhatsApp to Dropbox and Office 365 – cloud computing is increasingly becoming the nerve centre of IT infrastructure. Ireland saw major data centre investments and acquisitions in 2016, from Apple building an €850m data centre in Athenry, Co Galway, to Facebook building a massive data centre in Clonee, Co Meath. Combine this with Equinix buying Telecity and its raft of data centres in and around Dublin, and it’s clear that Ireland is in the eye of the data storm. This isn’t just about social media or e-commerce; the reality is that more and more IT infrastructure, which used to exist on premises in companies, will have moved to the cloud. IDC predicts that by 2020, 67pc of enterprise IT infrastructure and software will be in the cloud. By 2018, 60pc of IT will be done off premises and not only that, but 43pc will be processed at the edge by 2019. In a nutshell, cloud won’t be an Amazonian concept (sorry AWS) but rather, a fully fledged reality that is 100pc trusted by users. The fourth platform As cloud’s roots grow deeper, the idea of computing as a thing that sits on our desk or in our hands will dissipate. Even as more and more of the world’s population join the mobile revolution, the golden era of the smartphone is coming to a close. That doesn’t mean the smartphone is going away any time soon, but it will become the lynchpin of a slew of new computing experiences that will draw our eyes elsewhere. Big data, internet of things, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), 3D printing, robotics, next-generation security, blockchain – all of these technologies will happen around us, with data being the fabric and the smartphone being the connecting device. In other words, computing experiences will be occur without relying on a primary screen as the conduit. This is the fourth platform. The mainstreaming of AR and VR VR and AR have been slowly entering the fray. 2016 was a significant year that finally saw Microsoft take the wraps off HoloLens, as well as Oculus Rift arriving, along with a slew of competing devices from HTC, Samsung and Sony. VR has been a kind of revolution and it hasn’t. The high-end experiences promised by Oculus and Microsoft are still hampered by computing power. At the lower end, smartphone-based VR experiences from HTC and Samsung – and let’s not forget Google’s Cardboard and similar products which can be found in any supermarket or toy store – are still gimicky. Keep your eyes and ears (no pun intended) open for what Google intends to do with its Daydream headset, which portends a merging of the VR and AR worlds, so the headset can also overlay virtual reality experiences onto the physical world before us. In a sense, this could be the future of the recently shelved Google Glass or the newly launched Snap Spectacles. Expect the games and experiences to become more intelligent and textured. Keep an eye on what Irish firm Immersive VR Education – creators of Apollo and Titanic virtual experiences – has planned in the year ahead, as VR and AR move from novel to to natural. Smart things and voice Like I said, smartphones will occupy less of the stage and give way to smarter things. 2016 saw Amazon up its game with Echo, its voice-based e-commerce service, as well as its Dash buttons, which order consumables like washing powder or nappies in just one touch. Google will be no slouch in 2017, having already revealed its Google Home speech-based product at I/O earlier this year. This is Google’s fourth platform play and the company is closely shadowing, if not exceeding, rivals like Apple on the payments front. 2017 will see a kind of arms race, where players like Amazon and Google will endeavour to become the partner of choice for a whole range of internet of things (IoT) players who see e-commerce as a potent ingredient in their smart things. Facebook acceleration, Oculus telepresence and Slack rivalry Rather than being email killers (if only), most workers are up to their tonsils in additional tools and things to keep an eye on; like Slack, Trello, Wrike, and other digital platforms aimed at simplifying workflow. Others giants like Microsoft (Teams) and Facebook (Workplace) added to the cacophony in 2016. It is high time that someone decided to dominate this space for once and for all with tools that eradicate the need for all the others. There is a golden opportunity for Microsoft to do more to bring Skype and Teams together, or for Facebook to finally reveal its telepresence vision for the future of work with Oculus and Workplace. Keep an eye on other dark horses like Cork-based Teamwork or Salesforce (which almost bought Twitter). They may do something to finally get rid of the screen noise and clutter (sorry, Microsoft) that is the reality of the modern-day worker. The iPhone hits 10, Apple revs up for its newest phase It is hard to believe that it is nearly 10 years since Steve Jobs took to the stage at Apple World in 2006 and said “One more thing …” That one more thing was the iPhone and, having gone through more than seven different phases of the device, Apple will no doubt do something to celebrate the iPhone at 10. Considering the phone’s form factor has remained mostly the same for the last three generations, I expect Apple to reveal a wholly new design to the iPhone to signal its next phase. As I said, only Apple really knows what this form factor will look like, but expect the design to inform all future phone designs from rivals in the Android camp. I mean, why break with tradition? Another next phase for Apple, however, may see the company finally break its silence on what it intends to do with cars. Apple is revving up to be a big noise in the IoT and healthcare spaces, but the idea of an Apple car is still igniting people’s imaginations. Will Apple build a car or just a car OS? Given that Apple has so far dashed expectations on television hardware, the car idea is one that just won’t disappear. Codenamed Project Titan and spearheaded by some of Apple’s top talent and roughly 1,000 workers, Apple may choose the timing of the 10th anniversary of the iPhone to shed some light on the future of the company for the next decade. Will that involve four wheels? Definitely. But will it be an Apple car or OS? We’ll have to wait and see. The Solar revolution Given that Elon Musk’s master plan goes beyond cars and includes trucks, buses and homes, the attractive economies of scale of solar panels are hard to ignore. Musk recently revealed his solar roof concept that would use tiles made of glass, which look like ordinary roof tiles, to power up homes. This might not sound as crazy or unfeasible as you would think, when you consider that Scientific American recently said the average cost of solar models per watt dropped from $22 in 1980 to under $3 today. It suggests that soon, an average solar tile per watt will be $1.75. That makes 2017 a lynchpin year for a whole new revolution in solar energy. But time will tell.

There’s still plenty of time to grab the prezzies for the gadget lovers in your life. Getty 15 Here are the gadgets you might be hoping Santa will bring you this Xmas And if you don’t know where to start, don’t worry: our resident tech guru Lee Bell has done the leg work for you with a roundup of the best gizmos and gadgets available right now. Whether the special person in your life is a fitness freak or a booze hound, or even if you’re planning to splash out and surprise your loved one with a laptop or tablet, and don’t know which to go for, we’ve got you covered. Here is Lee’s rundown of the essential pieces of tech for the tech lovers out there. Best Laptop: Lenovo Yoga 900 15 If you’re going to go all out and treat someone (or yourself) to a laptop but don’t quite have the funds for a Macbook, the best Windows alternative is the Yoga 900. This is Lenovo’s slimmest convertible yet thanks to its Intel’s latest Core processor. And better still, it’s even thinner than a Macbook Air, measuring just 14.9mm thick. In good old Lenovo Yoga style, the 900’s screen can be flexed 360 degrees, turning the device into a tablet. Something a Macbook can’t do! It’s a fresh, fun and innovative device with fast and responsive performance all built into the slimmest chassis you’ve ever set eyes on.   Best Tablet: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 15 If you or someone special to you is in the market for a brand new tablet this year, the Surface Pro 4 could be a contender, especially if they need a new laptop too, as it can replace that as well. For most tasks you’d require a laptop for, including basic design work, the Surface Pro 4 will do the job. Its price of £635 for the basic model and keyboard means it’s not likely to tempt standard iPad or tablet users, but in place of a laptop the cost becomes more palatable. Whether it’s for a daily work commute, jet-selling lifestyle, or just slouching in front of the TV, the detachable Surface Pro 4 offers high-powered performance in a compact, stylish design.   Best smartphone: Apple iPhone 7 Reuters 15 While die-hard Android fans won’t agree, the iPhone 7 is yet another victory for Apple, and is still the greatest smartphone in the world. It’s by far the best phone on the market right now, so if you’re willing to splash out to get the best handset available this Christmas, this is it. Apple’s new gizmo is, well, a lot like the last one: pretty much perfect, with an even better camera, water resistance and super slick iOS 10 interface. The iPhone 7 starts at £599 SIM free. On contract, EE is offering some great contract deals at the moment, starting from £45.99 a month. But don’t just order online, give them a buzz and see what deal you can squeeze out of them. They’ll always come down in price if you are determined enough. We took a brand new iPhone 7 and threw it down the toilet to see if it is waterproof   Best smartphone on a budget: Xperia X Compact 15 Not everyone has iPhone money. So if you're planning on getting your loved one a smartphone to unwrap this Xmas but can't quite stretch to the £500-plus range, the Sony Xperia X compact is one of our favourites. Priced just over the £350 mark, the Xperia X Compact boasts a stellar design that fits in one hand with a massive 3GB RAM and a super smooth, easy to use interface. But best of all, it has a two-day battery life, meaning you won't find yourself reaching for the charger before you've even got home from work.   Best headphones: Bose QC35 Noise-Cancelling Wireless Headphones 15 If you're looking to drown out those jingle bells this Christmas, these noise-isolating cans are the best you can get your mittens on. Not only are they completely wireless, freeing up your hands to do other important Christmasy things, like munching mince pies, but they can block out all annoying external sounds. If the eardrum-splitting screams of needy children is too much to bear, pop on the Bose QC35 headphones and boom, it's like you're in another, child-free world. Available for £289.95, they don't come cheap, but noise cancellation feature is too good to overlook. It's also well matched with the comfort offered by the earphones' fit and sound, which is smooth in that it doesn't favour either treble or bass. The best over the head earphones you can get right now, hands down.   Best console: Sony PlayStation 4 Slim 15 One of the the world’s bestselling consoles has been on a diet. The PS4 is now slimmer, lighter and even cheaper, especially this Christmas time. Tesco has some great bundle deals starting at just £229.99 with one game with free collection from selected Tesco outlets. With visuals that are more realistic and vivid than what is even possible to see with human eye sees, why wouldn't you want to spend Xmas in another dimension? You can also now step that up a notch and step inside that world with the Playstation VR headset, where you will feel like you're actually part of the game. Sony's VR headset is the future of gaming, and is precisely why the PS4 is our console of choice this Xmas.   Best speaker: Sonos Play:1  15 If you're in the market for the small speak with a big sound, look no further than the Sonos Play:1, the most affordable Sonos player yet. If you're looking to upgrade from a tiny Bluetooth speaker to something with a little more punch, this multiroom speaker doesn't just have a great sound quality and glorious build, it's future proof, as connects to your devices over WiFi, freeing your Bluetooth up for other things, while having a much wider range. Walk anywhere in your without disconnecting, as long as you're connected to WiFi you're good to go. At £149, it's a great compact speaker for rocking around the Christmas tree this festive period.   Best wearable: TomTom Spark 3 15 With GPS, heart rate monitoring and timing tools all in one fitness tracker, the TomTom Spark 3 is an ideal Christmas gift for those looking to get back in shape right after the Christmas binge period. Aimed at runners, cyclists and gym-goers fed up with taking their smartphones on the gym floor, the Spark 3 lets users track activity every sprint, stroll and step as well as see the total time, distance and the calories burned. But best of all, the Spark 3 features built in storage for songs and uses Bluetooth to sync to wireless earphones (included) so you don't have to take your smartphone everywhere you go when working out, giving you more freedom to run, jump or dance around. Being one of our favourite fitness tracking wearables of 2016, the TomTom Spark 3's £220 price tag is - in our opinion - worth every penny. There's also cheaper alternatives available if you're not too fussed about he built in music function.   Best gadget for cult-film lovers: Propel Star Wars Battle Quad drones 15 Yes, it's quite niche, but you can't go far without bumping into a die hard Star Wars fan these days, so if you're wanting to treat your favourite Jedi nerd to something they can't not love, the Battle Quad drones are the way to go. At £229.99 a pop, the drones aren't cheap. But the look on the face of the person opening the box will be worth every penny. It's by far the most impressive product packaging we've ever seen, with the Star Wars theme tune and flashing lights blaring out of the box - literally! The drones come in a range of designs depending on your favourite Star Wars vehicles. There's the T-65 X-wing Starfighter, Darth Vader’s TIE Advanced X1, or the 74-Z Speeder Bike from Return of the Jedi, giving pilots the chance to fly for either the Empire or Rebel Alliance. As well as flying to speeds above 35mph in less than three seconds, a unique flight control algorithm enables special manoeuvres that mimic Star Wars flight patterns, such as forward moving corkscrew rolls. One of our favourite toys this Xmas, especially for the adult-children we know.   Best gadget for him: Braun Series 9 electric shaver 15 Whether you're a clean cut fellow looking to treat himself to a new toy this Christmas, or someone who likes their man to be shaven at all times and wants to give them the biggest hint ever, the Braun Series 9 will do the trick. Combining closeness and skin comfort, the Series 9 is Braun's best razor yet, and cuts more hair in one stroke. A specially designed shaving head captures flat lying hairs and hairs growing in different directions, meaning you won't need to go over the same spot twice, significantly reducing the risk of skin irritation. Perfect for those not wanting a stubble rash that puts Rudolf's nose to shame. Still not convinced by electric razors and fancy a more traditional offering for the favourite smooth-faced man in your life (while saving a bit of dosh)? There's always the Gruum subscription grooming kit. With Gruum, each box is tailored to the man's needs, whether they have a beard, clean shaven, or sensitive skin, and are delivered on a monthly basis from just £10 a month to keep them topped up and the razors staying sharp. No stray hairs this Christmas!   Best gadget for modern nostalgia: Polaroid Snap Touch 15 Remember the good ol' days when you'd take your gigantic Polaroid camera out just for the benefit of instantaneous photos? No? Well, whether you did or you didn't, there's a new camera in town, built on the same premise as before but with some pretty neat tech baked in. The Polaroid Snap Touch is an instant digital camera that allows you to snap, print, and share all of your favorite photos instantly with app-driven creative and new Bluetooth connectivity. Thanks to Zink Zero Ink technology, photos print out instantly without the need for ink cartridges as the ink is built into the photo paper. There's also a 3.5-inch LCD touchscreen in the back so you know what's going to be coming out before you hit the print button. Worthless in the iPhone age, but perfect for nostalgic memorabilia. It's available now for £160. Best gadget for the wannabe barista: Dualit 4-in-1 One Touch coffee machine / DeLonghi ECP31.21 15 Make your favourite coffee drinker happier than a pig in sugar this Christmas with a proper grown up coffee machine that makes them feel like they work in Starbucks. The Dualit 4-in-1 One Touch was our favourite all-in-one coffee maker by far in our most recent espresso-machine tests, and at £180, it's a bargain for those that mean business when it comes to feeding their caffeine addiction. Its patented Pure Pour tech delivers a smooth and consistent flow of espresso with a dense 'crema', while an adjustable frothing arm creates lovely texturised milk for lattes and cappuccinos. On a bit more of a budget but want the same effect? The DeLonghi ECP31.21 Italian Traditional Espresso Coffee Maker can be picked up on Amazon for almost half the price at just £95 and while it doesn't offer as many feature or high build quality, its just as good for bringing out the barista in you.   Best gadget for the forgetful: The Tile Slim 15 As its name suggests, the Tile Slim is a sized-down version of the popular Bluetooth tracker , an ideal stocking filler for that person you know who’s always losing things. Tile is literally that - a plastic tile that pairs with your smartphone via a special app, which you can control so it emits a piercing ringing sound the next time you lose your wallet. And if you've lost your smartphone, the Tile Slim can force it to ring aloud - even if it's switched to silent. What's also great about the Tile Slim is that it's as thin as two credit cards, so can live unobtrusively inside your wallet or purse. And costing just £23 at the moment, you can't not buy one if you're prone to misplacing things.   Best gadget for the booze hound: AlcoSense Excel 'Morning After' Breathalyser   15 'Tis the season to be silly. And it's easier than you think to unintentionally drink drive the morning after a boozy Christmas evening if you went a bit too far with the Bailey's the night before. That should be a thing of the past with this nifty little gadget. The AlcoSense Excel means you'll never accidentally drink drive the next day again. Being the first breathalyser under £100 to use a smaller version of exactly the same sensor used in several UK Police-approved breathalysers, the AlcoSense Excel brings a new level of accuracy and reliability for drivers, a great passive-aggressive Christmas gift for your favourite booze hound friend.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOLLING: So, Sean, President Obama yesterday was talking to NPR and he has said that he was considering retaliatory moves against Russia given the hacking and what we know. Tell me, he actually said I think there's no daughter when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, we need to take action and we will. And the next line was, at a time and a place of our choosing, some maybe explicit and publicize some of it may not be. Now, Sean, does President-Elect Donald Trump want President Obama with 35 days left in his term to get involved with Russia in any way, shape or form? SEAN SPICER, CHIEF STRATEGIST AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC: I think President-elect Trump recognizes that there's one president at a time. President Obama has 30 some odd days left in his term and on January 20th this country will have a new president. Real change will come. While President Obama is president, he has the right to do what he thinks is in the country's best interests and when President-elect Trump becomes President Trump on January 20th, I think whether it's our foreign policy or domestic policy, you're going to see real change come to Washington at this country. BOLLING: Right. But does he want President Obama to step aside and let him take care of it in 35 days or is he willing to deal with whatever Obama decides to do right now? SPICER: Well, I think that the problem that we have right now Eric is this, that we hear a lot of sources that say the following happened or didn't happen on November 17th, the director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke to the House Intelligence Committee and at that time he said that they had no con exclusive proof that the WikiLeaks and the other revelations were conclusively tied to Russia. Now, if President Obama does have that information and the intelligence conclusively points to it, that he needs to make decisions in a base in the country's best interests. But I think that one of the things that the media keeps conflating is an attempt to say if Russia or other entities are probing, you know, different sites which is what you get all the time, this so-called fishing exercise, where they send e-mails and try to find ways to break through different accounts into data, that's one thing. But there is zero proof that they had any impact on the election in terms of the outcome. And I think that's what's happening now is an attempt by folks on the Left and some folks in the media frankly to de-legitimatize the huge win that Donald Trump had and I think that it's sad because if you think about where we were 38 days ago prior to the election, it was the administration and others in the media saying that we need to have absolutely integrity in our election and anyone who questions it should be, you know, shouldn't be taken seriously because we have so many voting systems, there's no way that you could compromise integrity of our election. So -- BOLLING: But I find it curious that President Obama today said that yes, he knew that we had Intel, that they were hacking yet he choose now, now, yesterday to say in his words, we will take action. SPICER: Well, and I think that if we do -- but one of the things that's really gotten lost in this -- and again, I want to make it very clear to everyone watching, any foreign entity or any entity that seeks to undermine or interfere in a U.S. election should be stopped, fall stop, no question about it. But if you look at what happened, it was Hillary Clinton who had a secret server that wasn't in accordance with government regulations. It was the DNC that didn't came up with their technology security measures that's been reported. It was John Podesta and Hillary Clinton, I mean, and Jennifer Palmieri, Neera Tanden (ph), and David Brock, they wrote the things that got out and it was the mainstream media that covered it. This is not Donald Trump's fault. This is not the Republican's fault. They have brought this scandal to their doorstep and now they are trying to do everything they can to deflect from what they brought to themselves. BOLLING: Okay. Sean, you've been floated as a possible -- the next press secretary. Have you been asked? SPICER: No, I haven't. BOLLING: How will President-elect Donald Trump and President Donald Trump's relationship with the media evolve? What do you expect going forward with that relationship? SPICER: Well, I think that it's a two-way street. For so long the media has held politicians captive because most politicians frankly need the outlet. They need the media to communicate a message. Donald Trump has shown that he more effectively than frankly anybody else, celebrities, politicians, you know, you name it, can effectively get out a message to the American people and have a two-way dialogue with them in a way that no one ever has in our history. And I think that it scares the media, frankly. Now, he understands that the media is a very healthy part of our democracy, they need to be part of the process, but that he doesn't need them in the same way that everybody else has, I think frankly worries them a bit. BOLLING: Yes. And so, will he therefore restructure access that the media has to the presidency. SPICER: No, no, no. Look, look, he is unbelievably transparent. There's a camera from goodness sake in Trump Tower that shows everybody going up and down. We've allowed the press to have access. They're in a pool that follows him now. He understands that they're a healthy part of the democracy, but I think that he also has the ability to speak directly to the American people like no one else has. BOLLING: So there's a thing called the Trump way that we talked about it and you've done things differently and frankly you've won doing things differently. SPICER: Right. BOLLING: How do you think the relationship with the media should change and what should Donald Trump, President Donald Trump be tweeting? SPICER: Well, of course he should be and it's been effective. I think people don't like it sometimes because he does have this direct line to the American people and he frankly in a lot of cases is able to bypass the mainstream media. But to you first question, I think that one of the things that he realized is that he has this dialogue with the American people and he wants to expand it whether it's the Facebook live or Twitter. He has a way to have a back and forth dialogue with the American people that is something very, very unique to him and it's something that he's going to continue to do. But he will continue to -- and then frankly the other thing is that I think the mainstream media has had a strangle hold on a lot of stuff and I think that we've seen conservative media play a much bigger role and they should be brought into this process a lot more as well. BOLLING: All right. Thank you very much, Sean Spicer. We appreciate your time. And by the way, Donald Trump having 30 million Twitter Facebook and Instagram followers. Boy, that is some access that he has -- to the American public. Leave it right there. Sean, thank you. SPICER: Thanks, Eric. Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

Luckily, there are several Quora threads written by former and current employees devoted to answering questions about life inside the Fruit Company. We put some highlights together with info we got from our own sources, and reports elsewhere. Their comments reveal how employees are prepared to pull all-nighters at a moment's notice, how their trash is monitored by security, and how much they enjoy working with the best. New interns get a box that contains the following hardcore message:   From Christina Quan, Apple software development intern.   If Apple rejects your internship application, forget about trying again. Apple has software that prevents would-be interns from applying twice. So if you're rejected, that's it. According to Mac Consultant Frank Lazar: "Apple is such a golden opportunity for interns that it can be extremely choosy about who gets to play in their circular sandbox. They look for interns with amazing talent, and in their view, if you failed to show evidence of talent the first time around, a little experience somewhere else isn’t going to change anything."   "We don't waste time with the dumb." UX designer Luis Abreu had a grueling job interview process in a failed attempt to get into Apple. He described it on his blog: "3 screening calls, 5 FaceTime interviews, a trip to Cupertino for 5 two-person interviews lasting a whole day and a lunch at the newest Café Macs. In the end, I got a shallow no." During one interview he was told, “We don’t waste time with the dumb.”   Once you get in, "it's a tough place to be if you're more than 20 pounds overweight." Anonymous: "There are a lot more fit and good looking people at Apple, than otherwise. It's actually pretty ridiculous. Almost everyone is really athletic: many people do triathlons, bike races, and marathon. It's a tough place to be if you're more than 20 pounds overweight, but then again, it can also be that extra push you need to get in shape. I know of people who've lost 60 pounds and are no longer pre-diabetic because they started going cycling with their coworkers over lunch."   "Trash bins were monitored." Tim Su wrote this list describing secrecy at Apple: - code names for every product - no one referred to products any other way - team members who are also on "special" teams don't tell their coworkers what they do - black curtains and frosted windows - trash bins were monitored   "Guys in the developer group had to show up for meetings at 4:00am." David Graham, former writer at Apple: "I remember when bleary-eyed guys in the developer group had to show up for meetings at 4:00am to allow for time-zone differences around the world. They had to do it every day, and I’m sure it disrupted their personal lives."   "Apple employees don't just use Macs — they use really buggy Macs, often with really buggy apps." Brent Royal-Gordon, code writer: "Internally, most devices are running test builds of all the software on them, often updating every couple of weeks with the very latest code from the engineering teams. So Apple employees don't just use Macs—they use really buggy Macs, often with really buggy apps. People on the iOS teams often use really buggy iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, too. This ensures that the company catches a lot of bugs before anyone on the outside ever sees the software."   Apple products are built in factories that run on ... Microsoft Windows. In 2014, CEO Tim Cook tweeted a photo of an Apple factory in Asia he had visited. The manufacturing line was run using screens that clearly showed Microsoft's Windows operating system. That is no surprise: Certain industrial CNC milling programs only run on Windows.   In the stores, there is a lot of clapping. Renee Morales, former Apple Store Specialist: "There will be a lot of clapping. As a new hire you'll get ‘clapped in.’ At the end of every shift meeting there's clapping. When someone quits, on their last day they get ‘clapped out’. Sometimes just for kicks to make a little kid feel good you'll clap. ….there's just a lot of clapping."   You might get death threats from customers whose devices break down. An Apple store worker told Business Insider: "I have had death threats before. I had someone, I can’t even remember why — it may have been an out-of-warranty fix — who told me that because we wouldn’t repair it for free that they would wait outside until I finished work to run me down with their car."   You will have to learn Apple's weird internal secret culture — quickly. Wei Sun, Data Science / Software Engineering: "Almost everything will be at least slightly different from your previous job. If you’re an engineer, there are custom internal tools, unusual practices, and odd office culture norms — even more so than is typical at other companies. Questions should be asked as often as possible during your first month; don’t be afraid to ask."   "Furthermore, since secrecy is so important at Apple, different teams’ cultures had a chance to become incredibly different from each other. When working in cross-functional projects, take the time to learn about the other teams’ preferred communication styles and other peculiarities. This will save you a lot of time."   Apple controls what you talk about with your spouse. Justin Maxwell was a user interface designer: "The measures that Apple takes to protect its creative and intellectual environment are unparalleled in the valley, and it's been a disappointing experience since leaving there. Apple's security policy extends to blogs, to speaking engagements, to what we talk about with our spouses. Most people get it and respect it. The ones who don't -- the ones who need to put Apple under their name so they can get a speaking gig at SxSW -- are kindly ushered to move on." "If I was still at Apple, I would not be responding to this question, nor would I feel wronged for not being able to."   Apple makes grammar and punctuation changes in its internal documents in order to track leaks. After Business Insider obtained a couple of leaked memos from retail chief Angela Ahrendts, the company began making changes to its internal communications to help it figure out where the leaks came from. It now sends differently worded memos to different sections of the company in hopes of tracking leaks back to the source when those memos are quoted in the media.   "It's not the place for children." Anonymous: "It's an older demographic working there, not the 24-year old MBAs, most seem to be late 30's to 40's, super smart but with real life experience, too. There aren't any Nerf guns or any of that crap, just people past all that and at the top of their game. It's not the place for children."   "I've been in meetings at 4pm where a dozen people decide we are going to all work all night that night." Anonymous: "Apple comes first.  Not to say you can't have some personal life or even a pretty normal one, but when stuff gets crazy, work comes first ahead of all else. I've been in meetings at 4pm where a dozen people decide we are going to all work all night that night in the office on a problem.  No discussion about 'hey, I have to pick up my kids' or 'let me call home first' - everyone nods and agrees, no hesitation."   "You are in the office every day unless you are sick or dead." Anonymous: "No work from home. The company culture wants everyone face to face every day and they are very up-front and clear about it. You are in the office every day unless you are sick or dead. Nobody watches what time you are in every day but telecommute is something they very vocally say is not and will not be part of the culture."   They will email you in hospital. Former Apple employee Ben Farrell wrote a lengthy, detailed blog post explaining the reasons he quit the company:   "In recent weeks I contracted a nasty incapacitating mosquito born virus and was hospitalised for a short time. However, rather than receiving support, I was emailed a presentation to my hospital bed with a note that it needed to be completed ‘urgently’. Even on the very morning of my wedding I was still being harassed by phone and email to send a report someone had lost."   Sunday is a work day. Don Melton was the former director of internet technologies. He did a podcast in which he described Apple's insane work schedule: "Sunday is a work night for everybody at Apple because it’s the exec meeting the next day. So you had your phone out there, you were sitting in front of your computer, it didn’t matter if your favorite show was on."   Some hiring managers discriminate against older employees. There is a great story about JK Scheinberg in the New York Times: Scheinberg was "the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he'd be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. 'On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, "We'll be in touch,"' he said. 'I never heard back.'" "I'd scare the engineer by telling them how bad things would be if anyone inside or outside knew what I was going to ask them to do." Simon Woodside, program manager in Core OS: "Having all these secrets was difficult from my perspective. I couldn't really engage in idle banter with my colleagues for fear of slipping something out." "... I'd scare the engineer by telling them how bad things would be if anyone inside or outside knew what I was going to ask them to do. They would verify with their director, and hopefully be able to fix the relevant problem. We'd slip them some PC hardware if needed or preferably use Virtual PC or the like to be more inconspicuous. They certainly couldn't tell their co-workers about this work." "Personally, I didn't talk either ... my close friends and family knew I was working on some secret project but they didn't find out what until Steve himself made the announcement. Apple had total control of the message. The secrecy paid off big time for the company."   There is a serious risk of burnout. Steve Fenwick, hardware engineer: "You don’t work at Apple unless you are seriously motivated to work there. The ones who are there for a check, or stock, are the ones who burn out first and fastest." You will meet a LOT of different people with very different backgrounds. Rodrigo Estrada Gil, former maps engineer: "In my office there is a sports photographer, a documentary filmmaker, a pole dancer, a folk musician, engineers, translators, QA testers, a nurse, a forklift driver, advertising creatives, videogame testers, a trance producer, marketing people, a screenwriter, a documentary producer, ex-housewives, a Pink Floyd cover band singer, a pole dancer, a biologist, a theoretical physicist, a costumier, etc." “On a regular basis you either get positive feedback or are told to stop doing stupid s--t.” Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple designer: Every week, the highest-level execs review every aspect of Apple's business, Fortune reported: “From a design perspective, having every junior- level designer getting direct executive-level feedback is killer,” says Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple designer who now runs 80/20, a New York design shop. “On a regular basis you either get positive feedback or are told to stop doing stupid s--t.” Borovsky now works at CADRE.   Folks who work in Apple's stores are so poorly paid they often cannot afford to buy the products they sell. An anonymous store worker told Business Insider: "I had a friend who worked there who absolutely loved the products and would go into his overdraft, go into debt, to buy the latest Apple product. It is crazy. One of the managers had to leave because his landlord wouldn’t renew his lease. He had to leave the store because he couldn’t afford to even move into a new studio flat on an Apple Manager salary. I think he went back to live with his parents. He was in his late 30s. Maybe 40."   Ariel Maislos: Stay paranoid and keep running. The former CEO of Flash memory company Anobit, which was acquired by Apple, told ZDNet: "They say that Intel is full of paranoids, but at Apple, 'they' really are after you." "At Apple, you have to run ahead just to stay in place, and there are very high expectations of everyone. Apple expects everything you do to be amazing."   "Paranoid management, disrespect, constant tension, and long hours." Anonymous: "Generally speaking it is a pressure cooker and all communication is one directional (guess which way that is)." "... Paranoid management, disrespect, constant tension, and long hours sum up most of the real culture in operations ... Most of the people in SDM (supply demand management) see it as something they need to suck up for a few painful years after b-school so they can move on to a better gig with the Apple brand on their resume. Like the investment banking of tech." "... Work here at your own risk.  On the upside, cafe food is pretty good and dress is casual."   Andrew Guan, Apple China: It can be like a cult. "I don't know what the internal culture is like in the States, [but] in China, it's pretty insane. Imagine, on the quarter meeting, manager stand on the table and shouting 'WHO ARE YOU!' All the employees raise their hands over the head and answer 'WE ARE APPLE!'"   Austin Meyer: Working at Apple is like being at war. A fun war. Meyer told this story, as published on Macrumors: "Being at Apple is almost like what I imagine it would be like to be inside of Boeing during World-War 2: Everything is running at 100% throttle, with knowledge that we are running at 100% of our abilities, and that is enough to guarantee the best product, and guarantee success in the final outcome, but nothing less than a 100% delivery is acceptable. Apple is fighting a War against Microsoft, with a clearly FAR superior product, but with the very clear knowledge that it is a FUN war to fight, that they are clearly WINNING, but that they can NOT slip up even the slightest bit if they want to have ultimate success."   Brandon Carson, contractor: "Your work is peer-vetted." "They desire and demand a collaborative atmosphere. Your work is peer-vetted -- we had to present our work to the team and take feedback." "At first I found this a bit disruptive, cause I'm used to working on my own projects in a silo, but at the end of the day, the collaboration ensured a better product. And the work didn't progress too far without checks and balances." "More companies need to operate like that internally."   "All the maple surfaces in all the retail stores are harvested at one particular time of the year in Canada so they all look the same." Richard Francis, formerly of Intel, who worked on a project with Apple says on Quora: "The brand is guarded with a zeal that borders on zealous obsession. For instance - I heard (unconfirmed) that all the maple surfaces in all the retail stores are harvested at one particular time of the year in Canada so they all look the same."   Back when Tim Cook was only the COO, he gave this explanation for Apple's secrecy: “Well, that is a part of the magic of Apple. And I don’t want to let anybody know our magic because I don’t want anybody copying it,” Fortune reported.   Apple used to sell this T-shirt at its HQ campus store.   Need we say more.

The South Korea tech giant just announced its new Notebook 9 laptops that are mostly similar with the previous models save for the inclusion of a new processor and minor design tweaks.  On Monday, The Verge found out that Samsung refreshed its 13-inch and 15-inch Notebook 9 devices and added Kaby Lake processors on them. The inclusion of Intel’s 7th generation processors is expected to boost the performance of Samsung’s thin laptops. This is regarded as a minor but a remarkable upgrade to the devices that debuted with Skylake processors.  In addition to the new processor, Samsung’s Notebook 9 portable computers have also seen a few design changes. The chassis is now more curved than the usual and the bezels have become slimmer, but not quite unnoticeable for the laptop to feature edge-to-edge display technology. The minor alterations have contributed to the lighter weight of the two models. The 15-inch model now weighs 2.17 pounds, while the 13-inch model weighs 1.8 pounds. Finally, the backlit keyboard is a welcome addition to the laptops.  Related Stories LG Supplying Batteries For Galaxy S8: Report Apple To Use Samsung Curved OLED Displays? Samsung Android Security Patch For Galaxy S7 And Galaxy S7 Edge Now Available In India Although there are undeniably positive changes that Samsung has done to the Notebook 9 laptops, there is also a downside to the upgrade. Samsung says the new models can last up to 7 hours. It can be noted that for the previous models, Samsung claimed that they were good to run for around 12 hours. The Verge maintained that this is not a bad thing, however, for the predecessors also lasted for around 7 hours per its own testing and Samsung may have just overestimated the battery life of the laptops with Skylake processor.  For those who are not familiar with Samsung’s Notebook 9 line of devices, TrustedReviews revealed that the 15-inch model sports 8GB of DDR4 dual-channel memory and up to 256GB of storage. Meanwhile, the 13-inch model comes with up to 16GB of DDR4 dual channel RAM and up to 256GB of SSD. Both models pack in Full HD displays with 1920 x 1080p screen resolution.  Samsung has yet to provide the pricing details for the refreshed laptops and the dates when they’ll be available for purchase. However, it’s clear that Apple’s biggest rival has timed the announcement of these upgraded models with CES 2017 already slated to happen this January. It won’t be surprising if the tech giant would showcase the laptops at the annual Las Vegas technology trade show.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Libav Now Supports VA-API HEVC Accelerated Decoding Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 19 December 2016 at 09:12 AM EST. 10 Comments For users of libav, the latest development code now supports hardware-accelerated HEVC/H.265 video decoding with the Video Acceleration API (VA-API). With this libav commit is the few hundred lines of code needed to support accelerated HEVC decoding with VA-API. Back in 2014 is when VA-API itself landed HEVC decode while last year also brought HEVC encode support. VA-API decode was also implemented in the Gallium3D state tracker and then for Intel's VA-API driver is supported with Skylake and newer though not until Kabylake is there full 10-bit H.265 support. This comes after Libav recently implemented VA-API accelerated VP8 decoding (finally!) as well as VA-API accelerated de-interlacing. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

John Naughton Obviously it’s impossible to say exactly what drew Silicon Valley’s finest to Trump Tower, but power and money may have something to do with it Donald Trump’s meeting with technology bosses last week. Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images Sunday 18 December 2016 04.00 EST Last modified on Sunday 18 December 2016 04.02 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close On Wednesday, a curious spectacle could be observed in New York. A swarm of tech billionaires arrived in their private jets and were whisked to Trump Tower, the Louis XV pastiche that is the residence of Trumplethinskin, as the tech journalist Kara Swisher calls the president-elect. The roll call of assembled tech moguls ran as follows: Satya Natella and Brad Smith (Microsoft), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Larry Page and Eric Schmidt (Alphabet, Google’s holding company), Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook), Tim Cook (Apple), Elon Musk (Tesla), Ginni Rometty (IBM), Safra Catz (Oracle), Chuck Robbins (Cisco), Alex Karp (Palantir) and Brian Krzanich (Intel). Apart from their vast wealth and an aversion to paying tax, what linked these notables? Answer: a deep loathing of Trumplethinskin. Yet when he issued the summons to his preposterous “summit” they all came running. Why? In order to implement any of his proposed policies on border control, Trump will need a database. A very large database For the answer, we need to delve into the darker recesses of human nature. First of all, there was naked fear. During the election campaign, Trumplethinskin had made no secret of his contempt for the tech companies. He castigated Apple, for example, for not caving in to the FBI’s demand that it unlock the San Bernardino killer’s iPhone and for manufacturing the phone in China rather than in the US. He accused Amazon of abusing its monopoly power. And so on. But it wasn’t the abuse that spooked the tech crowd as much as his demonstration of what he could achieve with a single tweet. At 1:26pm on 12 December his tweet “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th” instantly wiped $4bn off the value of Lockheed Martin, the lead manufacturer of the $100m-a-pop warplane. If he can do that to an aerospace manufacturer, what could he do to the tech companies? In seeking an explanation for the abject obeisance of the tech moguls on Wednesday, we should also not underestimate the aphrodisiac effect of power. Trumplethinskin may be a repellent demagogue (and we know from off-the-record conversations reported by Swisher – the ultimate tech insider – that that’s how the Silicon Valley crowd see him), but on 20 January he will be president and proximity to power has a funny effect on many people. It causes them to lose their marbles, their judgment and sometimes their principles. So it was in New York on Wednesday when the assembled titans fawned on their host in his blinged-up lair. Thirdly, there is that old staple – greed. There is money to be made out of President Trumplethinskin. One of the first letters he received upon winning the election came IBM chief executive Rometty. “Dear Mr President-elect,” it gushed, “last Tuesday night you spoke about bringing the country together to build a better future and the opportunity to harness the creative talent of people for the benefit of all. I know that you are committed to help America’s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people. I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help realise the aspiration you articulated… I do so as the leader of the nation’s largest technology employer. Permit me to offer a few suggestions.” These included “data analytics, data centre consolidation and the use of cloud technologies” to cut government costs. Facebook Twitter Pinterest 3 million ‘criminal’ immigrants to be deported, says Donald Trump This is interesting for two reasons. First, Trumplethinskin isn’t any old chief executive but a president-elect who comes to power after a campaign that was laced with racism and promises of action against a particular ethnic/religious group: Muslims. In order to implement any of his proposed policies towards illegal immigrants, border control, etc, he will need a database. A very large database. So who will build it for him? The federal government? Given his contempt for the civil service, that seems unlikely. So it will be outsourced to tech companies and the question becomes: will they do it? In this respect, the IBM chief’s letter might turn out to be an inspired pitch for business. After all, the company could be said to have a track record in this line of business. Way back in the 1930s, its German subsidiary was the outfit that provided the Hollerith tabulating machines that were a cornerstone of the murder machine that ran the Holocaust. For the avoidance of doubt, this is not to say that IBM was responsible for the Holocaust or that Trumplethinskin is a genocidal maniac – just that, to update a 1970s feminist phrase, the technological has suddenly become political. Very political. So how will Silicon Valley respond when the next presidential summons comes? Stay tuned.

Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel. Ha! Hey, this is why companies can compete: Different priorities and tastes among potential users. Fanboys, don't get into a pissing match about which is better. Because both matter right now, and Microsoft gets good bang from the competition between them. Earlier today I asked Stephen Baker, NPD vice president and primary hardware analyst, about MacBook Pro and Surface Book sales. They are "key parts of the turnaround in the consumer PC market in terms of pointing it in a more premium direction", he says. "While they aren’t the share leaders, the advertising being spent and the marketing have helped lift all the Windows boats—and it of course hasn’t hurt that all the Windows brands have stepped up their premium product development". Wrapping up, the best laptop is the one with the benefits that matter most to you. That's how I came to choose 15.4-inch MacBook Pro -- and love it. Hehe. Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, heavy rains led my wife and I to drive to closer-distance Fashion Valley Mall, where there is Microsoft Store, inside which an irresistible Surface Book offer hypnotized me.

Samsung Notebook 9 gets updated with Intel's latest 7th generation processors T3 12/19/2016 Robert Jones < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > T3 image © Courtesy of T3 The Samsung Notebook 9 was already a very tidy device, securely lodging itself in our best ultraportable laptop 2016 roundup, however Samsung has revealed that it is now even better, with a brand new system offering both a refreshed design and support for Intel's 7th generation Kaby Lake processors. The news, which was revealed earlier today via Samsung's official newsroom, notes that both the 13.3-inch and 15-inch models now feature a brand new design, offering an ultra-slim bezel, near edge-to-edge display and a sleek single shell structure loaded with Micro Arc Oxidation (MAO) technology. The post also confirms that the new Samsung Notebook 9 now comes equipped with the latest 7th generation Intel Core i7/i5 processors, as well as faster storage and memory. From what we can see here the rest, specs-wise, is pretty much business as usual, with a 1,920 X 1,080, 350nit, FHD screen on offer along with the usual selection of ports (including two USB 3.0 ports and a single USB Type-C port). Battery life is now more conservatively listed at 7 hours on a single charge  however. Hopefully, the seemingly more robust and premium build and design, as well as a tasty core specs boost will help take the Samsung Notebook 9 to the next level.

Does the Congressional Black Caucus Really Care about Black People? December 19, 2016 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Politics, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) In last week’s column, I discussed the hypocrisy running rampant within the Democratic Party when it comes to the hiring of Black staffers. I must have struck a serious nerve, because I received an anonymous email from someone with seemingly high-level Democratic credentials that was most surprising. I have no idea who this person is, or what his/her agenda may be, but I was able to verify the details of the email I received. I called several friends who work for Democratic elected officials in the United States Congress and the Democratic National Committee. While not wanting to comment on specific members of the Democratic caucus, they agreed that the essence of the content of this anonymous email was very accurate. This email contained such detailed information on each Democratic member of Congress that it had to come from someone with intimate access to this type of sensitive data. What was sent to me was a listing of every Democratic member of Congress and who their fundraisers were. What’s ironic is that only one member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) has retained a Black fundraiser. The rest have either a White, Asian, or Hispanic person doing their fundraising. Yet, these same members of the CBC have the gall to criticize the U.S. Senate for their lack of diversity when it comes to hiring Black staffers. Mind you, that most CBC members themselves have very few Blacks in positions of power on their personal staffs or committees. Maybe, Black Democrats should simply “self-identify” as illegal, transgendered or radical Muslim extremist refugees, because they seem to get all the benefits that only American citizens are supposed to get, but I digress. Last year, members of the CBC traveled to Silicon Valley to lecture executives from Apple, Google, Intel, SAP, and Pandora about the lack of Blacks in their workforce. Their then chairman, U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina said, “All of them are deficient. None of them have African Americans on their boards of directors, and that is very disappointing because African Americans are part of the customer base of all five of these companies.” Maybe, just maybe, members of the CBC should have a visit to their own member’s offices and determine why most of them have no Black chiefs of staffs and no Black fundraisers. In the immortal words of Michael Jackson, maybe members of the CBC should take a look at that man in the mirror, and ask him to change his ways. If they want to make the world more diverse, take a look at themselves and make that change. So, before Black folks continue to complain about what “Whites” are not doing for us, maybe we should look at what we’re not doing for ourselves. Why should others do for us what the Black members of Congress are not willing to do for us? Why do they refuse to hire capable Black Democrats with fundraising experience? The CBC, like Africa in the United Nations, is the largest voting bloc in the U.S. Congress. So, they can stop any piece of legislation presented in the House, thus they have supreme leverage and never use it to push forward any policy that they claim to care about. Blacks are the largest voting bloc, but have no Blacks in leadership positions in the House. Why did they turn their backs on esteemed Congressman Jim Clyburn when he got ousted from leadership so that Steny Hoyer could assume a leadership post? So, let’s get this straight, the CBC goes around the country lecturing Silicon Valley about their lack of diversity, though they are guilty of the same thing. They complain about the lack of diversity on corporate boards, but at least Corporate America takes care of their own — Whites. But the CBC won’t even hire their own when it comes to fundraising jobs. So, if Whites hire those that look like themselves, why won’t the CBC do the same? Diversity is not an “either,” “or” proposition, it’s a “both,” “and.” CBC members criticize Silicon Valley for having few Black staffers, they criticize the U.S. Senate for having few Black staffers, but they’re silent when it comes to conscious decision not to hire Black fundraisers for their own campaigns. So, if Silicon Valley and the U.S. Senate can be labeled “racist” for their lack of Black staffers, shouldn’t the CBC have to wear the same label?

While companies are required to file this information annually in a form known as EEO-1, they are not legally obliged to make the data public. Facebook, eBay, Google, Yahoo and LinkedIn are among the technology companies that have made public their EEO-1s […] Chief among the companies that decided not to disclose their EEO-1s were Microsoft, Twitter, Apple and Amazon. When USA Today pressed the matter, Twitter released its filing and Microsoft agreed to do so by the end of the month, but Apple and Amazon did not respond …  Stanford fellow Vivek Wadhwa, author of Innovating Women: The Changing Face of Technology, said that the companies have a responsibility to be accountable to the public for their hiring practices. This refusal shows that they have something to hide. If they didn’t have anything to hide, they would come clean. While Apple has not commented on the reason for its refusal, the piece notes that technology companies are critical of the EEO-1 form, complaining that its job classifications are a poor match for the tech industry. Intel’s chief diversity officer Rosalind Hudnell acknowledges this, but says that it is the best available measure at present. “I hope everyone eventually shares their EEO-1s,” Hudnell said. “If we are going to commit as an industry to drive improvement in a collective fashion, we cannot do it with inconsistent data.” Tim Cook has stated that he is not satisfied with Apple’s current diversity numbers, which show that Apple’s US workforce is 70% male and 55% white, and has a number of initiatives designed to address the issue. One of these is a number of $10k Inclusion and Diversity Scholarships for minorities in tech, another a film designed to emphasise the company’s commitment to diversity. Tim Cook spoke of racial equality and gay rights in a speech in Alabama, and of course officially came out as gay shortly afterwards. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

The title should be Apple doesn’t respond to USA Today request. In that vein, I wonder if USA Today will ask the NBA why the players don’t seem to reflect racial in terms of percentages; I always figured they’re hiring the best players for the job as opposed to favoring one race. Maybe Apple does the same? LikeLiked by 1 person Dean Har - 2 years ago Reply If you’re trying to make a good case against diversity, you probably should stay far away from athletics. If the wealthy wanted to dominate the NBA, know that they very well could. There aren’t many whites in the NBA simply because basketball typically isn’t the sport white parents want to pay for their kids to learn. But when you look at sports that require expensive equipment and coaching, you’ll find that the wealthy always dominate. That’s why Serena and Venus Williams (tennis) and Gabby Douglas (gymnastics) are such a big deal. Most families in their financial position don’t have the time or luxury to deal with the exorbitant costs of coaching, training, and traveling nor do they have the patience to deal with the financial and racial discrimination that comes along as a package deal. That’s actually the reason why Serena and Venus’s father stopped sending them to tournaments when they were kids. The racial discrimination, sadly from the parents (and most likely the kids as well), was too much for them to handle and ultimately not worth their time.

What ever happened to the idea of “best person for the job”? LikeLiked by 1 person gen0music - 2 years ago Reply What happened was you guys spent 300 years building the place using the best people for the job: slaves. Then you didn’t pay the African Americans back for what they built and worked because you couldn’t afford to if you wanted to. 50 years after you freed them, you’re already moaning about having to have them around? Look, smart black people actually aren’t that hard to find. Neither are dumb ones, but the difference is that it’s very hard to reward someone who works hard and get’s educated despite being pretty much forced to go to a lower performing school, and a lower performing college, and then is seen as “not the best person for the job” because he is not the closest to hand, lives in a bad area, is competing with people who went to a better school, or a host of other reasons that are either beyond his control or make him have to work disproportionately harder than his white peers to achieve the same thing. Today, the US segregates every race to their own area so that there are black schools and black colleges, black cities and black counties, all without breaking your own anti-racism laws. Yet you still have 80% of the wealth held by one race, and 25% of the other race are below the poverty line. I once told my boss about a (fictional) great IT admin born, raised and living in Compton who just needed a job to get out, and he almost laughed at the idea it was even possible. That’s why Affirmative Action exists. LikeLike sardonick - 1 year ago What a nice apologist answer. Bollocks. And for every “you people” there’s plenty of you people too.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Gigabyte's P57X v6 gaming notebook reviewed Full-fat Pascal comes to notebooks by Eric Born  2:56 PM on December 19, 2016 Gaming laptops got a shot in the arm this summer when Nvidia announced that its GeForce GTX 10-series GPUs would be going mobile without the "M." Laptop manufacturers have since been able to slot full-fat versions of Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080, GTX 1070, and GTX 1060 graphics processors into their machines without forcing buyers to break out the decoder ring to figure out what's changed between those parts and the desktop versions of the chips—mostly. With Pascal-equipped laptops now available from basically every major manufacturer, it's a good time to study how well these notebooks fulfill their promises. Can this next generation of mobile graphics chips truly deliver desktop-class performance within the tight confines of a laptop chassis? To help us answer that question, Gigabyte kindly provided us with a P57X v6 laptop equipped with a mobile GeForce GTX 1070. This version of the GTX 1070 is the mobile Pascal that's most changed from its desktop cousin. The Founder's Edition GTX 1070 has a boost clock range of about 1683 MHz, but the laptop variant is rated for 1645 MHz. That said, If you've read any of TR's Pascal reviews, you'll know that those numbers can significantly understate the actual clocks that those cards can reach. To make up for this potential deficit, Nvidia actually enabled a few more stream processors and texture units on its midrange mobile parts: 128 more stream processors than the desktop model, bringing it up to 2048 total, and eight more texture units, for a total of 128. Depending on how Gigabyte's cooling system shakes out, that's quite a bit of graphics power in a machine that can be taken on the go. Gigabyte tends to adhere to a minimalist aesthetic for its laptops, and the P57X is no exception. Its glossy black plastic chassis doesn't scream for attention, although the backlit keyboard might attract some interest from friends and coworkers. The generous venting on the bottom and back, however, identify the P57X as a gaming laptop. In addition to the small orange accents on the machine's hinges, sharp angles on the power button, speaker grilles, and vents give this machine some personality. Today, we're most interested in what's under the hood. Gigabyte paired the GeForce GTX 1070 with Intel's Core i7-6700HQ, a popular processor in gaming laptops this last year. It's a quad-core processor with Hyper-Threading that has a base clock of 2.6 GHz and a 3.5 GHz Turbo speed. 16GB of DDR4-2133 RAM round out the basic hardware package. One element of this laptop that might raise an eyebrow or two is the display. Gigabyte installed a lovely 17.3", 1920x1080 IPS panel that's bright, colorful, and provides excellent viewing angles, but some might consider that resolution rather low for such a large notebook screen. It also might seem to betray this machine's gaming ambitions. Our benchmarking of the GTX 1070 in a desktop system showed that it's more than capable of handling games at 2560x1440 and occasionally even at 3840x2160, depending on the game and settings. One might assume that a gaming laptop equipped with the GTX 1070 would ship with a tricked-out panel, perhaps with a higher resolution, higher refresh rate, G-Sync, or all three, for that matter. After running some benchmarks, however, we were reminded why it's bad to assume things. First, in a couple of instances we found ourselves capable of pushing settings so high that the P57X couldn't keep up, even at its native 1920x1080 resolution. Second, it appears that Nvidia's G-Sync technology still doesn't cooperate with its power-saving Optimus tech. Those who need robust battery life might hesitate before giving up Optimus. Finally, our tests show that 1920x1080 might be the highest resolution this laptop can really handle when it's running off of its battery instead of its 200W power brick. Though we'll get into more detail about this machine's performance shortly, it actually seems that a good old 1920x1080 display is still a fine choice for a powerful gaming laptop. For those interested, here's a full chart of the P57X's hardware:   Gigabyte P57X Processor Intel Core i7-6700HQ Memory 16GB DDR4-2133 Chipset Intel HM170 Express Graphics Intel HD Graphics 530 Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 with 8GB GDDR5 RAM Display 17.3" IPS panel with 1920x1080 resolution Storage Transcend MTS800 M.2 SATA SSD, 256GB Hitachi Travelstar 7K1000, 1TB Panasonic UJ8G2 DVD-RW Expansion options: Swappable drive bay for 9.5mm / 7mm drives (if DVD-RW is removed) Audio 2 2W speakers Expansion and display outputs 1 USB 3.1 Type-C 3 USB 3.0 HDMI 2.0 with HDCP 2.2 Mini DisplayPort 1 D-sub Card reader 1 SD card reader Communications Realtek Gaming Gigabit Ethernet adapter Intel 802.11.ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.1+LE Input Devices Backlit keyboard Clickpad Internal microphone Camera HD webcam Dimensions 16.57" x 11.42" x 1.13"  (421 x 290 x 28.6 mm) Weight 6.6 lbs (3.0 kg) Battery 75.81Wh Li-polymer Power adapter 200W OS Windows 10 Home A P57X v6 configured similarly to our test unit goes for about $2000 on Newegg right now.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe From the release of Tesla’s Autopilot to the proliferation of blockchain, 2016 was a watershed year for emerging technology. Smart watches got a little smarter; computers got a little smaller; and conversational interfaces got a little more, well, conversational. With 2017 just around the corner, many shoppers are already eagerly awaiting the gadgets and services the new year will bring. Though Moore’s Law, the exponential growth of computer chip power, officially kicked the bucket in 2016, the rate of innovation and progress in tech seems to be accelerating. Below are five technologies that promise another exciting year for both the technophile and average consumer alike. 5G Wireless Just about anyone who owns a smartphone (nearly two-thirds of all adults in the United States) has endured the frustration of a slow or inconsistent internet connection. Symptoms include interminable video buffering, stuttering music streams and social media feeds that won’t load. 5G connectivity aims to relegate these gripes to the same proverbial dustbin as dial-up modems. Promising download speeds of 10 gigabits per second, 5G will make it possible to download an entire HD movie in less than a minute. In contrast, 4G LTE maxes out at 1 gigabit per second and, given ideal conditions, will need about an hour to download an HD movie. Most U.S. telecoms have already conducted successful 5G trials. Virtual Reality Ever since Oculus Rift launched its Kickstarter campaign in the summer of 2012, consumers have been waiting anxiously for virtual reality to hit the mainstream. Four years later, that still hasn’t happened. But a confluence of factors points to 2017 as the year VR finally takes hold in a big way. For starters, when Oculus Rift launched its first consumer VR headset in March 2016, it was estimated that less than 1 percent of the world’s PCs were powerful enough to meet its recommended specifications, with Rift-capable laptops costing about $1,500. But fast-forward six months and $500 Oculus-capable PCs are readily available. Additionally, the launch of PlayStation VR in October delivered virtual reality to a much broader audience, especially given reports that the headset also works on competing platforms such as Microsoft’s Xbox One. Augmented Reality While virtual reality aims to immerse users in a digital world, augmented reality promises to make more of the physical one. Through high-resolution graphical overlays, AR creates a mixed reality that has proved useful for gaming, navigation and other areas. Now, with the viral success of Pokemon Go, consumers have demonstrated a keen interest in AR. And 2017 promises bigger and better implementations for the nascent medium. Microsoft’s HoloLens is among the first AR-dedicated wearables to hit the market, albeit as a preproduction developer’s edition with a $3,000 price tag. As the name suggests, the headset displays “holograms” on top of physical objects. One particularly eye-popping demo shows Minecraft playing out atop a coffee table. A secretive startup called Magic Leap is working on its own AR headset, though few outside the company have seen the hardware. Still, that hasn’t stopped Magic Leap from sharing stunning demo videos. Consumer release dates have yet to be announced by Microsoft and Magic Leap, but it’s widely speculated that both companies will ship new products in 2017. Internet Of Things The first wave of IoT offerings mostly amounted to a bevy of fitness trackers and smartwatches. These were followed in short order by personal assistants driven by artificial intelligence. While these were fine products in their own right, they didn’t exactly deliver on the promise of a connected, sensor-driven world. That could change in 2017, if tech giants like Intel and Qualcomm put their considerable weight behind a universal IoT ecosystem. The premise here is simple: Creating standards for interoperability among IoT products will give consumers a platform that delivers more than the sum of its parts. It’s not hard to see the potential benefits of such a platform. For example, connected fitness trackers and refrigerators already exist. Now imagine if the two could exchange data and then provide dietary recommendations based on activity levels and food currently in the fridge. Wireless Charging Nikola Tesla first demonstrated wireless power transmission more than 100 years ago when he illuminated a light bulb without a wired power connection. The principle behind that demonstration — inductive charging — has been used for years in everyday appliances such as electric toothbrushes. But the technology is far from reaching its potential. Although the dream of a fully wireless world is still a ways off, 2017 will see more wireless charging implementations than ever. Both Mercedes-Benz and Tesla will support wireless charging of electric vehicles next year. Apple is rumored to be integrating wireless charging into the iPhone 8. And drone makers are looking to wireless charging to drastically increase the amount of time a drone can stay in the air. With so much in the offing, 2017 promises to be a year to remember — one of faster downloads, smarter tools and more cut cords.

Passaic County Sheriff’s Officer Michael Webber was outside of 100 Hamilton Plaza when employees from the Market Street store told him what happened, Sheriff Richard H. Berdnik said.

Detectives of Berdnik's Criminal Investigative Division worked with their colleagues from his Gang Intel Unit to identify 28-year-old Israel Rodriguez -- a documented gang member -- as the suspect, the sheriff said. Last Wednesday, sheriff's detectives found Rodriguez at an Oak Street residence and arrested him, Berdnik said.

Lifestyle Tech Apple employees break their vow of secrecy to describe the best — and worst — things about working for Apple Jim Edwards, Business Insider Sunday 18 December 2016 15:46 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech Apple chief executive Tim Cook unveils the latest Macbook Pro range during an event at the Apple Headquarters in Cupertino, California EPA Apple has a strict code of secrecy that it expects all employees to live by. Anyone who breaks it is fired.  Unsurprisingly, employees rarely speak publicly about what it is like to work there.  Luckily, there are several Quora threads written by former and current employees devoted to answering questions about life inside the Fruit Company. We put some highlights together with info we got from our own sources, and reports elsewhere.  Their comments reveal how employees are prepared to pull all-nighters at a moment's notice, how their trash is monitored by security, and how much they enjoy working with the best. ↓↓↓ New interns get a box that contains the following hardcore message: (Quora) From Christina Quan, Apple software development intern. If Apple rejects your internship application, forget about trying again. Apple has software that prevents would-be interns from applying twice. So if you're rejected, that's it. According to Mac Consultant Frank Lazar: "Apple is such a golden opportunity for interns that it can be extremely choosy about who gets to play in their circular sandbox. They look for interns with amazing talent, and in their view, if you failed to show evidence of talent the first time around, a little experience somewhere else isn’t going to change anything." "We don't waste time with the dumb." UX designer Luis Abreu had a grueling job interview process in a failed attempt to get into Apple. He described it on his blog: "3 screening calls, 5 FaceTime interviews, a trip to Cupertino for 5 two-person interviews lasting a whole day and a lunch at the newest Café Macs. In the end, I got a shallow no." During one interview he was told, “We don’t waste time with the dumb.” Once you get in, "it's a tough place to be if you're more than 20 pounds overweight." Anonymous: "There are a lot more fit and good looking people at Apple, than otherwise. It's actually pretty ridiculous. Almost everyone is really athletic: many people do triathlons, bike races, and marathon. It's a tough place to be if you're more than 20 pounds overweight, but then again, it can also be that extra push you need to get in shape. I know of people who've lost 60 pounds and are no longer pre-diabetic because they started going cycling with their coworkers over lunch." "Trash bins were monitored." Tim Su wrote this list describing secrecy at Apple:  - code names for every product - no one referred to products any other way - team members who are also on "special" teams don't tell their coworkers what they do - black curtains and frosted windows - trash bins were monitored "Guys in the developer group had to show up for meetings at 4:00am." David Graham, former writer at Apple: "I remember when bleary-eyed guys in the developer group had to show up for meetings at 4:00am to allow for time-zone differences around the world. They had to do it every day, and I’m sure it disrupted their personal lives." "Apple employees don't just use Macs — they use really buggy Macs, often with really buggy apps." Brent Royal-Gordon, code writer: "Internally, most devices are running test builds of all the software on them, often updating every couple of weeks with the very latest code from the engineering teams. So Apple employees don't just use Macs—they use really buggy Macs, often with really buggy apps. People on the iOS teams often use really buggy iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, too. This ensures that the company catches a lot of bugs before anyone on the outside ever sees the software." Apple products are built in factories that run on ... Microsoft Windows. In 2014, CEO Tim Cook tweeted a photo of an Apple factory in Asia he had visited. The manufacturing line was run using screens that clearly showed Microsoft's Windows operating system. That is no surprise: Certain industrial CNC milling programs only run on Windows. In the stores, there is a lot of clapping. Renee Morales, former Apple Store Specialist: "There will be a lot of clapping. As a new hire you'll get ‘clapped in.’ At the end of every shift meeting there's clapping. When someone quits, on their last day they get ‘clapped out’. Sometimes just for kicks to make a little kid feel good you'll clap. ….there's just a lot of clapping." You might get death threats from customers whose devices break down. An Apple store worker told Business Insider: "I have had death threats before. I had someone, I can’t even remember why — it may have been an out-of-warranty fix — who told me that because we wouldn’t repair it for free that they would wait outside until I finished work to run me down with their car." You will have to learn Apple's weird internal secret culture — quickly. Wei Sun, Data Science / Software Engineering: "Almost everything will be at least slightly different from your previous job. If you’re an engineer, there are custom internal tools, unusual practices, and odd office culture norms — even more so than is typical at other companies. Questions should be asked as often as possible during your first month; don’t be afraid to ask." "Furthermore, since secrecy is so important at Apple, different teams’ cultures had a chance to become incredibly different from each other. When working in cross-functional projects, take the time to learn about the other teams’ preferred communication styles and other peculiarities. This will save you a lot of time." Apple controls what you talk about with your spouse. Justin Maxwell was a user interface designer: "The measures that Apple takes to protect its creative and intellectual environment are unparalleled in the valley, and it's been a disappointing experience since leaving there. Apple's security policy extends to blogs, to speaking engagements, to what we talk about with our spouses. Most people get it and respect it. The ones who don't -- the ones who need to put Apple under their name so they can get a speaking gig at SxSW -- are kindly ushered to move on." "If I was still at Apple, I would not be responding to this question, nor would I feel wronged for not being able to." Apple makes grammar and punctuation changes in its internal documents in order to track leaks. After Business Insider obtained a couple of leaked memos from retail chief Angela Ahrendts, the company began making changes to its internal communications to help it figure out where the leaks came from. It now sends differently worded memos to different sections of the company in hopes of tracking leaks back to the source when those memos are quoted in the media. "It's not the place for children." Anonymous: "It's an older demographic working there, not the 24-year old MBAs, most seem to be late 30's to 40's, super smart but with real life experience, too. There aren't any Nerf guns or any of that crap, just people past all that and at the top of their game. It's not the place for children." "I've been in meetings at 4pm where a dozen people decide we are going to all work all night that night." Anonymous: "Apple comes first.  Not to say you can't have some personal life or even a pretty normal one, but when stuff gets crazy, work comes first ahead of all else. I've been in meetings at 4pm where a dozen people decide we are going to all work all night that night in the office on a problem.  No discussion about 'hey, I have to pick up my kids' or 'let me call home first' - everyone nods and agrees, no hesitation." "You are in the office every day unless you are sick or dead." Anonymous: "No work from home. The company culture wants everyone face to face every day and they are very up-front and clear about it. You are in the office every day unless you are sick or dead. Nobody watches what time you are in every day but telecommute is something they very vocally say is not and will not be part of the culture." They will email you in hospital. Former Apple employee Ben Farrell wrote a lengthy, detailed blog post explaining the reasons he quit the company: "In recent weeks I contracted a nasty incapacitating mosquito born virus and was hospitalised for a short time. However, rather than receiving support, I was emailed a presentation to my hospital bed with a note that it needed to be completed ‘urgently’. Even on the very morning of my wedding I was still being harassed by phone and email to send a report someone had lost." Sunday is a work day. Don Melton was the former director of internet technologies. He did a podcast in which he described Apple's insane work schedule: "Sunday is a work night for everybody at Apple because it’s the exec meeting the next day. So you had your phone out there, you were sitting in front of your computer, it didn’t matter if your favorite show was on." Some hiring managers discriminate against older employees. There is a great story about JK Scheinberg in the New York Times:  Scheinberg was "the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he'd be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. 'On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, "We'll be in touch,"' he said. 'I never heard back.'" "I'd scare the engineer by telling them how bad things would be if anyone inside or outside knew what I was going to ask them to do." Simon Woodside, program manager in Core OS: "Having all these secrets was difficult from my perspective. I couldn't really engage in idle banter with my colleagues for fear of slipping something out." "... I'd scare the engineer by telling them how bad things would be if anyone inside or outside knew what I was going to ask them to do. They would verify with their director, and hopefully be able to fix the relevant problem. We'd slip them some PC hardware if needed or preferably use Virtual PC or the like to be more inconspicuous. They certainly couldn't tell their co-workers about this work." "Personally, I didn't talk either ... my close friends and family knew I was working on some secret project but they didn't find out what until Steve himself made the announcement. Apple had total control of the message. The secrecy paid off big time for the company." There is a serious risk of burnout. Steve Fenwick, hardware engineer: "You don’t work at Apple unless you are seriously motivated to work there. The ones who are there for a check, or stock, are the ones who burn out first and fastest." You will meet a LOT of different people with very different backgrounds. Rodrigo Estrada Gil, former maps engineer: "In my office there is a sports photographer, a documentary filmmaker, a pole dancer, a folk musician, engineers, translators, QA testers, a nurse, a forklift driver, advertising creatives, videogame testers, a trance producer, marketing people, a screenwriter, a documentary producer, ex-housewives, a Pink Floyd cover band singer, a pole dancer, a biologist, a theoretical physicist, a costumier, etc." “On a regular basis you either get positive feedback or are told to stop doing stupid s--t.” Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple designer: Every week, the highest-level execs review every aspect of Apple's business, Fortune reported: “From a design perspective, having every junior- level designer getting direct executive-level feedback is killer,” says Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple designer who now runs 80/20, a New York design shop. “On a regular basis you either get positive feedback or are told to stop doing stupid s--t.” Borovsky now works at CADRE. Folks who work in Apple's stores are so poorly paid they often cannot afford to buy the products they sell. An anonymous store worker told Business Insider: "I had a friend who worked there who absolutely loved the products and would go into his overdraft, go into debt, to buy the latest Apple product. It is crazy. One of the managers had to leave because his landlord wouldn’t renew his lease. He had to leave the store because he couldn’t afford to even move into a new studio flat on an Apple Manager salary. I think he went back to live with his parents. He was in his late 30s. Maybe 40." Ariel Maislos: Stay paranoid and keep running. The former CEO of Flash memory company Anobit, which was acquired by Apple, told ZDNet: "They say that Intel is full of paranoids, but at Apple, 'they' really are after you."  "At Apple, you have to run ahead just to stay in place, and there are very high expectations of everyone. Apple expects everything you do to be amazing." "Paranoid management, disrespect, constant tension, and long hours." Anonymous: "Generally speaking it is a pressure cooker and all communication is one directional (guess which way that is)."  "... Paranoid management, disrespect, constant tension, and long hours sum up most of the real culture in operations ... Most of the people in SDM (supply demand management) see it as something they need to suck up for a few painful years after b-school so they can move on to a better gig with the Apple brand on their resume. Like the investment banking of tech." "... Work here at your own risk.  On the upside, cafe food is pretty good and dress is casual." Andrew Guan, Apple China: It can be like a cult. "I don't know what the internal culture is like in the States, [but] in China, it's pretty insane. Imagine, on the quarter meeting, manager stand on the table and shouting 'WHO ARE YOU!' All the employees raise their hands over the head and answer 'WE ARE APPLE!'" Austin Meyer: Working at Apple is like being at war. A fun war. Meyer told this story, as published on Macrumors: "Being at Apple is almost like what I imagine it would be like to be inside of Boeing during World-War 2: Everything is running at 100% throttle, with knowledge that we are running at 100% of our abilities, and that is enough to guarantee the best product, and guarantee success in the final outcome, but nothing less than a 100% delivery is acceptable. Apple is fighting a War against Microsoft, with a clearly FAR superior product, but with the very clear knowledge that it is a FUN war to fight, that they are clearly WINNING, but that they can NOT slip up even the slightest bit if they want to have ultimate success." Brandon Carson, contractor: "Your work is peer-vetted." "They desire and demand a collaborative atmosphere. Your work is peer-vetted -- we had to present our work to the team and take feedback." "At first I found this a bit disruptive, cause I'm used to working on my own projects in a silo, but at the end of the day, the collaboration ensured a better product. And the work didn't progress too far without checks and balances." "More companies need to operate like that internally." "All the maple surfaces in all the retail stores are harvested at one particular time of the year in Canada so they all look the same." Richard Francis, formerly of Intel, who worked on a project with Apple says on Quora: "The brand is guarded with a zeal that borders on zealous obsession. For instance - I heard (unconfirmed) that all the maple surfaces in all the retail stores are harvested at one particular time of the year in Canada so they all look the same." Back when Tim Cook was only the COO, he gave this explanation for Apple's secrecy: “Well, that is a part of the magic of Apple. And I don’t want to let anybody know our magic because I don’t want anybody copying it,” Fortune reported. Apple used to sell this T-shirt at its HQ campus store.

The regulations promise to reduce energy consumed by computers by about one-third, saving power customers about $373 million in utility bills by 2027, and figure to have effects far beyond California. Computers and computer monitors in the state use an estimated 5,610 gigawatt-hours of electricity, representing up to 3 percent of residential electricity use and 7 percent of commercial use. “Such efficiency improvements are good for consumers, good for the electric system, good for the environment and frankly good for the green credentials of the manufacturers,” said Andrew McAllister, a commission member who helped guide the new rules through a four-year process of consultations with industry that culminated in Wednesday’s 5–0 vote in Sacramento. The first of the new standards will start Jan. 1, 2018, to be completed in stages by July 1, 2021. One of the rules’ chief targets is desktop computers, which use about four times as much power as a typical laptop or notebook computer. Sometimes called “energy vampires” by efficiency experts, desktops are switched on 77 percent of the time but sit idle for 61 percent of those minutes, according to a recent study from a research team at the University of California, Irvine. Under the new rules, desktops must reduce how much power they draw by about 30 percent when idle by the beginning of 2019 and nearly 50 percent by mid-2021. Most computer monitors will also be affected, with the new rules establishing thresholds for the amount of power a monitor or display can consume even when they are in sleep mode. The standards also apply to laptops, but it’s estimated that about three-quarters of notebook computers on the market already meet the requirements. By 2021, the commission estimates, the new rules will make each desktop about $14 more expensive, but consumers would save more than $55 over five years in reduced energy bills. Monitors will cost about $5 more but are expected to lead to $30 in savings over seven years, the commission said. It said laptops will cost about $1 more, but that energy savings in four years will be more than $2. The Consumer Federation of America praised the regulations and said the cost savings more than make up for the increase in prices. “Believe me, the average consumer who can barely get 2 percent on his CD today, that’s a pretty … good investment,” Mark Cooper, the federation’s director of research, said in a teleconference after the commission passed the rules. Representatives from Intel Corp. and HP Inc. also took part in the teleconference, with HP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford calling the energy limits “ambitious but achievable.” The California Energy Commission has emphasized that manufacturers will have flexibility to meet the standards. The rules apply only to computers in California, but the state’s share of the computer market is so formidable — California by itself accounts for 25 million computer monitors, 23 million laptops and 21 million desktops — the new standards almost certainly will have ripple effects. “It will have a global impact and significantly change the way future energy-efficient desktops and all-in-one computers are designed and manufactured,” said Andrea Deveau, vice president of state policy and politics for TechNet, a trade group whose members include Cisco Systems and Microsoft among its members. But Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank based in Los Angeles, questioned the commission’s cost savings estimates and said consumers already have a built-in incentive to buy energy-efficient computers: keeping their utility bills low. “It’s always easy to say, ‘Hey, this is a really cheap way for people to save a lot of money,’ but for some reason, (consumers) just aren’t doing it,” Moore said. “So we, the energy commission, being all wise and powerful here in Sacramento, can make this happen for them. Because we know as the energy commission, we know far more about computer markets than dumb old computer makers, much less dumb old computer consumers.” The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, worked closely with the commission to develop the new standards. Pierre Delforge, the group’s director of high-tech-sector energy efficiency, said the savings estimates are “relatively conservative” and that rules will lead to huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, helping California meet its aggressive climate goals. By California Energy Commission estimates, the efficiency standards will save 2,332 gigawatt-hours per year — the equivalent of the power used by households in San Francisco and San Luis Obispo counties combined.

Pulled out the plug, opened side door to see that my card was burned for no good reason. Warranty expired a year ago I believe. My computer still works fine once I took it out (IGPU, now I've tried Pci-e back up card and it works just fine), so I wonder why did it burn out with light gaming? I clean dust regularly, it wasn't dusty and it wasn't overheating, temps were around 70 to 80 c depending on games I play, haven't overclocked or overvolted the card, it has been ruining on stock from day one. So, with my limited knowledge of electronics I have no clue if this card could be saved somehow, what do you think, is it possible to fix even though the PCB has burned deep from the looks of it?

You know, the sad thing is that I've bought it for gaming, but since I lack time to game I pretty much game on average about 1.5-2h/day, imo that is really light usage for few years and I can't believe it crapped out on me. I have an old GTX 280 as a back up card, I've been torturing it for hours now just to see if my PSU killed my GPU but so far everything is fine and voltages are stable, will leave it for another 5 or 6 hours to run but its most likely just 7970 decided to die on me. I found out that someone else with the same card had the same happen to him/her: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrac..._morning_fire/ It's possible that Gigabyte messed something up in design or something of that sort, has anyone else experienced same or similar problem?     Vicious-Deeds View Public Profile Find all posts by Vicious-Deeds   (#4) sykozis Ancient Guru     Videocard: XFX RX 470 Processor: Core i5 6600K Mainboard: MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Memory: Corsair DDR4-2666 Soundcard: Creative SB-Z PSU: Corsair CX750M 12-18-2016, 18:03 | posts: 19,702 | Location: US East Coast From the looks of it, repairing that card is unlikely.     sykozis View Public Profile Find all posts by sykozis     (#5) Extraordinary Ancient Guru     Videocard: EVGA GTX980 SC ACX2.0 4GB Processor: FX-8350 @ 4.8GHz / H100i Mainboard: ASUS Crosshair V Formula Memory: 12GB 2133 G.Skill Soundcard: Creative SB1040 7.1 PSU: Corsair RM1000 12-18-2016, 18:13 | posts: 16,460 | Location: 127.0.0.1 I agree with Sykosis, too much looks damaged to repair (without a huge amount of effort and time, sourcing the right parts, which may or may not work), time to upgrade IMO     Extraordinary View Public Profile Find all posts by Extraordinary   (#6) Vicious-Deeds Master Guru     Videocard: Radeon HD 7970 3gb Processor: Intel I5-2500K @ 4.0GHz Mainboard: Z68X-UD3h-B3 Memory: 12GB DDR3 Kingston Soundcard: PSU: Cooler Master rs-850-esba 12-18-2016, 18:47 | posts: 317 Yeah, its probably not worth bothering with it, its most likely beyond repair... A friend of mine is offering me Gainward GTX 670 Phantom for $100, though I haven't used nVidia since mx440 lol, and looking at benchmarks its about the same as 7970 if not little stronger. Maybe its wrong forum to ask about nvidia card in Radeon forums, but is it ok card, no problems, defects, etc.? In any case, thanks for responding, its much appreciated.     Vicious-Deeds View Public Profile Find all posts by Vicious-Deeds   (#7) vase Maha Guru     Videocard: - Processor: - Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: - 12-18-2016, 18:49 | posts: 1,359 | Location: #1 http://www.3dmark.com/fs/8257155 the part i circled in is the voltage reference ic, which is 99% the cause of the issue here. it stabilizes voltage/current independently from temps and power input/+draw. the components that are integrated downstream of this IC are affected of course. so either: - internally related - 1) the IC itself was faulty - externally related - 2) you had voltage(=current) spikes in the supplying main circuit (PSU) that strained the IC with out of spec numbers (most probable) 3) your card had a high power limit set and "asked" for more current than the IC could handle. (did you have the power limit manually adjusted?) of course it can be a combination of 1) + 2) or 1) + 3) as well. its a little sad to lose a card over that component. but repairing it still will need you to identify the damaged capacitors/resistors, remove them and the voltage reference, search for exact replacements, clean the circuit board of residue, resolder the new components. way too much effort especially considering not everyone has the tools... if you're an etech guy... sure go for it. although keep in mind the possibility that not all damage may be visible. leaving you with endless trial and error which parts have been affected additionally to the burnt ones. what you SHOULD do in any case though would be measuring your 8pin pcie rails of your PSU under medium gaming load (just as when the problem occurred). because an old faulty PSU (if that was the reason) will render your next new GPU useless again, just a question of time. the coolermaster is by the way known to have a relatively high standard deviation in its line regulation functionality. just as a sidenote.

I still have my GTX 280 torture testing (though the card is messed up, shows some little artifacts in 3d, but I use it for testing purpose and as just in case card because in 2D it works fine, dont care if it burns or dies). Anyways, I managed to find multimeter and I measured 2x6 pins for PCI-E, it shows aprox. 12.12v and 12.11 (it fluctuates by 0.01-0.02v up and down) under full load, that should be great I guess, not sure how stronger 7970 is but I dont think its pulling that many more amps then 280. In HW monitor for 12V it says 12.122V value and 12.120V as minimum (12.172V as maximum). Ive bought this PSU because I've read few reviews on it and found out that it was pretty solid unit with CWT OEM stuff inside, I think there was review on JonnyGuru where he tested it heavily and it passed pretty much everything, and it was on sale so I said why not. But yeah, CM PSU's arent that great mostly. About power limit, if you mean through Afterburner manually adjusting it then yeah, that and Fan speed I manually adjusted, fan speed to more aggressive settings to keep GPU cooler and Power Limit to 125 because it kept dropping to 85 which affected my FPS (instant drop in FPS when Power Limit drops). I had no clue that raising it can kill something, damn... I also have APC UPS unit rated at 2000W, even if there was current spike that should've protected my components, but who knows what the hell happened here.

I had no clue that raising it can kill something, damn... if everything is in order a raised power limit should be fine. just... when push comes to shove... it can be a deciding factor, amongst other preconditions that have to be present of course. again in general, raising power limit (inside the software boundaries, i guess thats +25% - 50% depending on tool ?!) in a perfectly stable system with healthy components is not a problem. if you raised it higher than your software slider offers to (for example through BIOS mods) then it's another story though...

Software-based encryption is carried out with the help of software to encrypt and decrypt data stored in the files/folders, hard drives, removable media, data travelling over the internet network through emails, etc. Encryption software use specific algorithms to convert data into a meaningless cipher text or encrypted text, which can only be converted to meaningful text using key, symmetric key (single key) or asymmetric key (pair of keys). Different encryption algorithms are available for symmetric and asymmetric keys. The most widely used algorithms under symmetric key are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple-DES, and Blowfish. Similarly for asymmetric key, the most commonly used algorithm is RSA. Regulatory frame work set by the governments about data privacy and compliance demands tighter security measures. With stringent regulations, the need for effective data security technologies is vital. While developed geographies such as America and Europe already have federal level regulations that require mandatory compliance with data privacy laws; however, developing regions such as APAC and LAMEA, are in the process of implementing more concrete data protection legislations.

Korea FOCUS Select Language ALL HEADLINES All Headlines (Yonhap Interview) For Sandoll CEO, creating Korean fonts equals finding true identity 2016/12/19 17:42 Tweet Facebook Share Google +1 Reduce Enlarge Print By Woo Jae-yeon SEOUL, Dec. 19 (Yonhap) -- Only a few Koreans might have heard of Sandoll Communications. But they are probably using the company's products every day when reading a book, using a computer, sending a text message or finding their way around town via traffic signs. CEO Seok Geum-ho has spent more than three decades in developing typography for the Korean alphabet hangeul, a task that was hardly given any attention when he first started in the late 70s. After graduating college, majoring in Applied Fine Arts at Hongik University, a popular art school in Seoul, Seok started his career as a designer for the Korean version of "Reader's Digest," a globally popular American monthly lifestyle magazine. He designed the cover page by handwriting the headlines and drawing the layouts with a fine brush. This undated photo shows Sandoll CEO Seok Geum-ho. (Yonhap) Soon after he started working, the Korean publishing industry began importing Japanese phototypesetting machines, which were considered a breakthrough in printing technology. Previously it had heavily depended on movable type pieces made mostly of metal lead. Along with the machines came a few imported Korean fonts. "I was so shocked to learn that our country was unable to print a single book without using Korean fonts that were made in Japan. For many days, I could neither eat nor sleep," he said in a recent interview with Yonhap News Agency. "I thought it didn't make sense and it hurt my pride."    He shuddered to think how his future children would react to the fact and his inaction. He even imagined that they would demand one day, "Daddy, you were a designer when your company imported hangeul from Japan. What did you do to change that?"    He couldn't just sit idle and watch, and he made a decision that would change his life. He quit the company to "do something about it." In the spring of 1984, he rented a small studio and started studying Korean typography and developing various fonts. With little demand for Korean fonts at that time, he did odd jobs like designing book covers for several years. He barely got by. "I remember I was always hungry. I ate instant noodles every day but I was just happy because I knew what I was doing and why I was doing it," he said. The image, taken from the website of Sandoll Communications on Dec. 19, 2016, shows various Korean typefaces the company has developed. (Yonhap) As the personal computer began to be released in the late 80s, the demand for different types of Korean fonts started to pick up. "I was like a fish in water. Suddenly I had to work overtime to meet the rising demand from businesses who wanted me to develop Korean fonts for word processor," the 61-year-old said. Now the company has developed nearly 600 Korean fonts, which are widely used not only by Koreans but by many global corporations including Microsoft, Apple, Intel and Google, to name a few. It also develops custom fonts for businesses, including Hyundai Card, Naver and Kia Motors, which increasingly use typography as a way to define their corporate identity. Sandoll Communications developed a custom font for Kakao Talk, a widely used Korean chat application. The image is taken from Sandoll's website on Dec. 19, 2016. (Yonhap) In 2008, the company has rolled out stationary and emoticon brand "Sandoll Tium." Its products -- ranging from notebooks to pencil cases to large emoticons on popular chatting app Kakao Talk -- became very popular, largely by provoking nostalgia with images and designs seen in the school textbooks from the 70s and 80s. Along with the friendly design that Koreans feel close to, smart and funny hangeul phrases are considered another reason for its popularity. Though his company diversifies, the core message Seok tries to give remained unchanged, he said. "I believe the core to Korean identity could be found in the spirits of King Sejong who sacrificed himself to create hangeul to make the lives of his people better and comfortable," he said. "When you fully accept the spirits and live by them, you would never forget who you are and where you came from."    The image, taken from the website of Sandoll Communications on Dec. 19, 2016, shows various badges with Korean wordings.

Brian J. Barth December 19, 2016 Environmental advocates may find that an unlikely ally—big business—helps them erect a firewall against the most damaging aspects of a polluter-heavy Trump administration’s agenda. PinItInstapaperPocketEmailPrint <a href="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=4ea03cc6b7f8a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=92678&cs=4ea03cc6b7f8a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> AP Photo/Elaine Thompson Solar panels and a green roof are among the sustainably-built features of the new Google building on the company's campus Tuesday, February 16, 2016, in Kirkland, Washington.  Environmentalists can be excused for feeling apocalyptic about Donald Trump’s presidency. Compared with Barack Obama, who championed the Paris Agreement, enacted the Clean Power Plan and preserved major swaths of open space, President-elect Donald Trump can come off as the planet’s grim reaper, ready to usher in a new era of dirty water, polluted air, and melting glaciers. Trump’s cabinet selections make crystal clear that his anti-environment rhetoric as a candidate was no mere campaign swagger. To head the Environmental Protection Agency, he has tapped Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a man who has repeatedly sued the agency. For energy secretary, he’s picked Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who once vowed to eliminate that agency. For secretary of state, Trump has tapped ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. To put the icing on the cake, he wants to install Arctic oil drilling advocate Ryan Zinke, the House Republican from Montana, as interior secretary. As League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski has put it, the incoming administration looks to be “a polluter paradise that is completely at odds with public support for protecting our air, water, lands, and wildlife.” But environmentalists may yet have a way to fight back. Though their public protests may fall on deaf ears as long as Trump is in the White House and Republicans control Congress, environmental activists may find more of an audience in corporate boardrooms. At a time when consumers are increasingly eager for green products, services, and energy sources, corporations are seeing the value of resource conservation as a long-term investment strategy, not just good PR or a grudging response to government regulations. And it’s not just Ben & Jerry’s these days that is taking earth stewardship, especially climate change, quite seriously; sustainability is baked into the structure of more and more Fortune 500 businesses. The imperatives of profit have never been so closely intertwined with those of our finite planet. Take Trump’s pledge to bring back coal. In economic terms, that’s a campaign promise that looks destined to fizzle. Simply put, natural gas, a significantly cleaner fuel than coal, has become a more economically viable energy source. David Victor, an energy policy expert at the University of California, San Diego, says that while the price per unit of energy for natural gas and coal are roughly the same right now, natural gas enjoys a decided market advantage, because 21st century grid operators prefer its properties as a fuel source. “Modern power plants need to be able to be turned on and off fairly quickly, but a coal plant is the exact opposite of that,” says Victor. “You need to keep a coal plant warm; the ramp-up for a coal plant from a cold start is many hours, if not longer. Gas plants are much more responsive.” And the “clean coal” that Trump likes to reference? It’s an idea that sounds seductive, but that doesn’t do much to reduce the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Clean coal refers to the application of carbon capture and storage technologies to coal-fired power plants—a process that involves diverting carbon dioxide from the smokestack and sequestering it underground in natural geologic formations that prevent it from seeping back to the surface. In practice, this technology is outrageously expensive. The only power plant in the world that has made the numbers come even close to working—the Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan, Canada—has done so by pumping the carbon dioxide into nearby oil fields, where it has value as an aid for fossil fuel extraction—a process known as enhanced oil recovery. But that can hardly be called a clean technology. While the process itself apparently is not polluting, it produces no net gain in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions—the entire point of clean coal. Just storing the CO2 in the ground would be a net improvement. But if the only economically feasible use of carbon capture is to extract more oil, it’s a zero-sum game. That’s because any oil extracted releases enough emissions when it’s burned to cancel out the potential benefit. Making truly clean coal a financially viable reality would require massive government incentives, whether in the form of tightened-up emission standards or a price on carbon—both approaches that run counter to Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly, roll-back-the-regulations ideology. The technology holds promise in places like China, where the coal industry is booming, and the political appetite exists for a nationwide carbon market. But in the U.S., clean coal is a non sequitur, both fiscally and environmentally, for the foreseeable future. Even many of the coal company executives with whom Trump is trying to ingratiate himself agree that natural gas is America’s new energy king. “The basic economics of the power sector now favor gas, and that has come directly out of the hide of coal,” says Victor.   NOT THAT TRUMP HASN’T ALSO PROMISED to pump up domestic production of natural gas, which is by no means the holy grail of clean energy. It has about half the greenhouse gas emissions of coal, but the “fracking” technology used to extract much of the nation’s natural gas supply is fraught with environmental problems of its own, from air and water pollution to increased earthquakes and habitat destruction. Nevertheless, some environmental advocates say natural gas offers a pragmatic alternative to dirtier fossil-fuel energy sources as a short-term bridge to buy time for wind and solar to scale up, given that the renewable energy industry is still in its infancy. And scaling up they are. In 2015, renewable energy sources accounted for two-thirds of the new electricity generating capacity in the U.S.—3,500 times greater than the new coal capacity. Investment in renewables is spurred on by the provisions of the Clean Power Plan, clean energy incentives in more than 30 states, and a pair of federal tax credits, which were authorized—with bipartisan support in Congress—through 2020 and 2021. Even if Trump is successful in eviscerating these incentives, the clean-energy sector has enough legs at this point to continue expanding, albeit it a reduced rate. For example, the 2016 Annual Energy Outlook, a publication of the U.S. Energy Information Agency, forecast that without the Clean Power Plan in place the growth of wind and solar would drop from 7.5 percent per year to 6 percent per year. Without the federal tax credits, the forecasted growth rate is cut in half. “The political coalition in favor of continued investment in renewables is much bigger and more powerful than [it] has been at any time in American history,” says Victor, who is one of the authors of an upcoming Brookings Institution report that will offer recommendations on energy policy to the Trump administration. “Trump himself can’t reverse the tax credits. The Republicans, as part of a tax bill, could undo that system of credits. But it’s not a simple left-right question—you have a number of red states in the middle of the country that are big wind producers, for example.” Thanks to the combination of market dynamics and government incentives, many of the world’s largest corporations already have plenty of eggs in the clean energy basket. Google, the world biggest corporate energy consumer, announced last week that it will be powered entirely by wind and solar in 2017. “I didn’t think it would happen so fast … [but] we’ve seen prices come down precipitously, which has helped us ramp up,” one Google executive told Bloomberg. Google is one of 83 major corporations that has publicly committed to operating with 100 percent renewable energy as part of the RE100 initiative, a joint project of the climate advocacy nonprofits The Climate Group and CDP; Apple, Walmart, and GM are all on board. Microsoft reached the 100 percent renewable energy milestone in 2014, and a majority of the other RE100 corporations are on track to do the same within a decade. The private-sector accounts for about half of the planet’s energy use, so having the biggest corporate trendsetters decide that renewable energy is a worthwhile investment tips the scales considerably. Some of the world’s biggest transnational corporations, moreover, are even spending political capital on clean energy. During the Marrakesh climate talks, which unfolded rather quietly in the week of the U.S. presidential election last month, 365 companies signed a statement directed at the incoming administration, urging Trump to uphold the Paris climate agreement and embrace the global effort to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Mars, Nike, General Mills, Hewlett Packard, Ikea, Intel, Kellogg, Monsanto, Dupont, Unilever, eBay, and Starbucks were among the largest and most influential companies represented. Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy programs for CERES, a nonprofit aimed at mobilizing the business community to take action on sustainability issues, and one of the groups behind the Marrakesh declaration, says that 10 years ago the idea that the private sector would lead the way on climate and other environmental issues would have seemed overly optimistic. But she is now fairly confident that, even if Trump does everything in his power to undermine the environmental movement, market forces will at least in part pick up the slack. “The economic equation has evolved so much, particularly in terms of the traction that clean energy has gotten with private sector entities,” says Reid. “So there is some real staying power now irrespective of what happens in terms of federal policy.” Not everyone agrees that private-sector environmentalism will offset the damage a Trump administration can do. Though the average global price of solar energy dropped 58 percent between 2010 and 2015, it still provides just 1 percent of global energy supply. And Reid says just 18 companies purchase 60 percent of the renewable energy produced in the U.S. today. “We definitely need to move beyond that to the small and medium enterprises,” she says. “But part of getting to those price declines was the role of large companies making these commitments. It has allowed renewable energy developers to take those contracts to the bank and get cheaper financing. And that has had this beneficial snowball effect of driving down the cost.” There is also the uncomfortable fact that the U.S., despite the efforts of the Obama administration, is not on track to meet its 2025 target of cutting emissions to one third of 2005 levels—nor are the signatories of the Paris Agreement on track to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius. Which means the federal government needs to do more in coming years, not less. David Festa, senior vice president for ecosystems programs at the Environmental Defense Fund, says he’s not fully convinced that the private sector will pick up where federal efforts lag under Trump, and will shepherd the environmental movement forward. “Optimistic is probably too strong a word,” says Festa. “It’s more like an absence of pessimism.” But he says the EDF, which long ago migrated from a primarily “sue the bastards” approach to a strategy of “aligning with companies to get things done,” is a firm believer in harnessing market forces to achieve a sustainability agenda. In the 1990s, the organization was instrumental in persuading McDonald’s to do away with Styrofoam packaging, which snowballed into a successful global effort to curb ozone depletion. He sees a similar phenomenon taking hold today on environmental issues ranging from climate change to habitat loss. “If you look at where some of the smartest and shrewdest business people are, where some of the most famous companies are, where the thought leaders are—including thought leaders on the right—they are looking at the need to be more resilient, the need to use our resources in a way that leaves more nature for future generations,” says Festa. “The next two years are going to be rough, no question. We are going to have to play a lot of defense. But if you step back and look at the longer time frame, the political pendulum will swing back to having productive conversations about the planet. In that light, I move from the absence of pessimism to cautious optimism.” PinItInstapaperPocketEmailPrint You may also like Rex Tillerson: An Oligarch’s Dream at the State Department Adele M.

After releasing the Yoga Book in Windows and Android OS variants, Lenovo has now confirmed that the 2-in-1 tablet will soon be available with Chrome OS. As per the report by Laptop Mag, Lenovo will bring the Yoga Book with Chrome OS in 2017. However, we don't know if this also stands for India as Lenovo launched only the Windows variant earlier this month starting at Rs 49,990. Further, the company didn't gave any estimated time period for the global launch. In a statement made to Laptop Mag, Lenovo's Vice President and General Manager of the Android and Chrome Computing Business Group, Jeff Meredith said - "We've had a lot of interest. It's an interesting idea for education, especially with the form factor. Over time, we probably see the Android and Chrome versions melding together, especially based on the fact that we've now seen Chrome roll out the Google Play store capability into Chrome. We'll probably maintain the three distinctive products throughout this year at least," Not only this, he also assured that the Chrome OS variant will come with all the features and components including the Real Pen as seen in the Windows or Android variant. Chrome OS has been under continuous development and is finally up as a strong OS after Android Apps integration. The OS is extremely light and should work well after all the Android Apps now available on the OS. Coming to the Yoga Book, the 2-in-1 tablet from Lenovo sports a 10.1-inch IPS full HD display coupled with Dolby Atmos for the audio making it up for perfect media consumption. On the inside, it is powered by an Intel x5 processor paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. For the ports, the device comes with a microUSB, micro HDMI and a microSD card slot for storage expansion. Lenovo Yoga Book comes with either Windows 10 Pro platform or runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. For the battery, there is an 8,500 mAh cell which Lenovo claims can provide up to 15 hours of use on Android and up to 13 hours on Windows. To know more about the launch, click here.

Ahead of CES 2017, the company is refreshing its Notebook 9 devices with improved hardware. But don’t get too excited, it’s a fairly minor refresh. The main upgrade with the new Notebook 9 devices is the new CPU which Samsung has upgraded to Intel’s latest Kabylake processors which offer slightly better performance the Skylake processors. The refreshed Notebook 9 line is also a bit lighter than the original Notebook 9 devices — the 15-inch variant of the device now weighs 2.17lbs (around 1kg) and 1.8lbs (around 840 grams). Here’s the full spec sheet: Feature Samsung Notebook 9 (15-inch) Samsung Notebook 9 (13.3-inch) OS WINDOWS 10 Home WINDOWS 10 Home PROCESSOR  7TH GEN INTEL® CORE™ i7 7TH GEN INTEL® CORE™ i5/i7 DISPLAY 15.0?, 350nit, FHD (1,920X1,080), 178°, LR, sRGB 95% Delta E<2.5, Outdoor mode (500 nits), Video HDR 13.3”, 350nit, FHD (1,920X1,080), 178°, LR, sRGB 95% Delta E<2.5, Outdoor mode (500 nits), Video HDR GRAPHICS SHARED SHARED STORAGE PCIe NVMe, up to 256GB SSD SATA3 SSD, up to 256GB SSD MEMORY DDR4 dual channel, up to 8GB (on board) DDR4 dual channel, up to 8GB for i3, up to 16GB for i7 (on board) WIRELESS 802.11 ac 2X2 802.11 ac 2X2 BLUETOOTH Bluetooth 4.1 Bluetooth 4.1 SOUND 1.5W X 2 SPEAKERS 1.5W X 2 SPEAKERS INTEGRATED CAMERA 720p 720p MIC Internal Dual Array Digital Mic Internal Dual Array Digital Mic KEYBOARD 1.5mm stroke, backlit, curved keycap, fingerprint sensor 1.5mm stroke, backlit, curved keycap, finger print sensor I/O PORTS 2XUSB 3.0, 1XUSB 2.0, 1XUSB-C, HDMI, MicroSD, HP/Mic 2XUSB 3.0, 1XUSB-C, HDMI, MicroSD, HP/Mic AC ADAPTER  45W small adaptor 45W small adaptor DIMENSIONS 347.9 X 229.4 X 14.9mm 309.4 X 208 X 13.9mm WEIGHT 2.17lbs 1.8lbs BATTERY 30Wh, Fast Charging, External Battery Charging 30Wh, Fast Charging, External Battery Charging MATERIAL / COLOR   Light Titan   Light Titan SOFTWARE Wi-Fi Transfer, Simple Sharing, PC Message, PC Gallery, SideSync Wi-Fi Transfer, Simple Sharing, PC Message, PC Gallery, SideSync Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

The basis of the legal challenge, according to Reuters, is the method the Gaggle of Red-tapers used to come to the lofty figure. Apple is seemingly calling the Gaggle of Red-tapers a bunch of money-grabbing so-and-sos after claiming it ignored tax experts and corporate law to use methods to maximise the amount it was demanding. Such devices inflated the tax bill unduly to €14 billion, Apple’s lawyers believe. The Gaggle of Red-tapers are accusing Ireland of dodging international tax rules, allowing Apple to shelter billions in profits in the country in exchange for keeping jobs in the country, a claim which is denied by both the accused. The current system in the European Union does not allow for individual companies to receive preferential treatment. Apple has paid €50 million on €22 billion sales since 2011, so the Gaggle of Red-tapers do have a point, though Apple contends is has used the opportunity to squeeze the company for as much as possible, making an unjust example of a brand which will generate headlines for the gold-digging bureaucrats. It does appear the Apple legal team has accepted it will have to pay some taxes back, but as with many legal battles, this one will come down to who has the best negotiating team. The rhetoric in the public domain from Apple will focus on how unjust the punishment is, though this is likely to be a PR play for sympathy against the Gaggle of Red-tapers, who have gone in hard with a strong opening hand. Pessimists will argue the Gaggle of Red-tapers have never intended to recover the full €14 billion, though it’s a good starting point to negotiate down. While keeping Apple happy will be a top concern for the Irish government, the impact should the appeal be lost could be much more disastrous in the long-run. Company Number of employees (estimated) Turnover (2015) Google 2824 €22.6 billion Microsoft 2000 €19.3 billion Dell Ireland 2500 €11.2 billion Apple Ireland 5000 €8.9 billion Oracle 1282 €8.1 billion Facebook 1500 €7.9 billion VMWare 661 €2.9 billion Intel Ireland 5200 €2.4 billion Symantec 987 €1.6 billion HP Ireland 4000 €1.3 billion Source: The Irish Times The table is a cherry picked selection of some of the global technology firms who have operations in the country. The nature of the relationship between the organization and the Irish government will vary, and some may not benefit from the same tax conditions the Apple team do, though there certainly is a tax incentive for these companies to operate in Ireland over many other countries in the European Union. Whether this saga creates ripples which will negatively impact the emphasis technology companies places on Ireland remains to be seen, though this will be the primary concern of the Irish government. A country which saw felt the brunt of the recession more than most during the 00s can ill-afford another mass exodus to cripple the economy. Apple will most likely have to repay some of the tax bill, though how much remains to be seen. The Gaggle of Red-tapers may not get anywhere near the €14 billion figure, Telecoms.com is betting Apple lawyers are slightly better than those representing the Gaggle of Red-tapers, though any win could set a precedent which allows bureaucrats with sticky fingers to start poking around in the financial affairs of (apparently) sovereign nations within the EU. Whether this move will offer the Gaggle of Red-tapers more opportunity to poke it’s nose into national affairs or create more complicated (and sometimes unnecessary) regulations remains to be seen, though with such incidents you can start to see where the rise of Brexit-style support is coming from.

As macOS does not have a comprehensive drive health indicator, DriveDx fills a critical role in measuring the overall health of both SSD and HDD drives. Because DriveDx tracks more indicators of impending failure than any other product on the market, users will get an advanced warning before their drives fail. This will allow them to take action to avert the failure, and save themselves from resulting data loss and downtime. Unlike many other drive health diagnostics utilities that simply check built-in S.M.A.R.T. status, DriveDx performs overall drive health diagnostics using drive health indicators (like SSD wear out / endurance, reallocated bad sectors, offline bad sectors, pending sectors, I/O errors, and more) that most closely correlate with drive failures according to the statistics reported in the latest researches focused on identifying drive failure trends. This gives a user a comprehensive picture of a current drive health status and enables foreseeing potential problems with drive failure and loss of sensitive data. Moreover, DriveDx shows this information on a user-friendly Mac-style interface in an easy-to-understand format. "Here's a DriveDx triumph. DriveDx showed my just out of AppleCare iMac with two pre-fail conditions for the hard drive. Made appointment and took it to Genius Bar yesterday. Tech looked at DriveDx and was very impressed. Even though out of warranty - they replaced the drive without question," said Michael Sidoric, CapMac User Group Treasurer, ex-Vice President of CapMac.org. "God knows how many dollars and troubles DriveDx saved me since I had several vital FinalCut projects on it." DriveDx is a combined drive health analysis and forecasting tool. It monitors and analyzes changes to S.M.A.R.T. attributes in order to continuously evaluate drive health status and predict drive failures. In addition to "Failed" and "OK" drive statutes DriveDx supports "Warning" and "Failing" statuses indicating that a drive is in a pre-failure status and backup of sensitive data is highly recommended. DriveDx performs both SSD and HDD health diagnostics. Moreover, it uses a separate set of indicators for SSD and HDD to monitor drive health status. This is particularly important as SSD works different from HDD, and requires a different algorithm to check its health status. Also, SSDs typically are more dependent on firmware than HDDs, and DriveDx has been programmed to support many versions of firmware (please see our website for a complete list of supported firmware). DriveDx allows configuring the delivery of customized drive status and free space reports by e-mail and therefore does not require user presence to inform about drive status changes. In addition, DriveDx can launch built-in drive diagnostics self-tests. Drive self-tests will help to quickly identify if the drive is faulty. DriveDx is the first utility of its kind to have a real user-friendly Mac-style interface. It is organized in a way that allows a user to view and understand drive status and its performance at a glance. User can switch between different view modes to drill up or down data related to drive health, including S.M.A.R.T. indicators and attributes, drive statistics and errors. What's New in DriveDx 1.5.1: * improved diagnostic algorithms and heuristics * secure updates over HTTPS * improved support of macOS Sierra * improved support for Apple SSDs * improved support for SanDisk SSDs * improved support for Samsung SSDs * improved support for Crucial/Micron SSDs * improved support for Toshiba SSDs * improved support for OCZ SSDs * improved support for Intel SSDs * improved support for Transcend SSDs * improved support for Kingston SSDs * improved support for Corsair SSDs * improved support of recent Seagate HDDs * improved support of recent Western Digital HDDsra * many stability improvements * many cosmetics tweaks and fixes DriveDx feature highlights: * support of modern SSDs and HDDs * SSD lifetime left indicator * different routines for SSD and HDD health evaluation * real-time SSD & HDD health status monitoring * user-friendly and intuitive UI * multi-tier warning system that will inform the user about deviations from the normal state of drive attributes * diagnostic Knowledge Base online auto-updating * drive overall health rating * drive overall performance rating (if drive supports this subset of indicators) * device statistics * I/O errors monitoring * drive free space monitoring * support of drive short and full (extended) self-tests * sending a warning whenever a problem with a drive firmware exists * saving detailed drive status reports to a file * warning a user with pop-up notifications about errors and failures * displaying drive status on a macOS status bar * runs natively on macOS System Requirements: * macOS 10.6.8 or newer Pricing and Availability - DriveDx 1.5.1 has 4 types of licenses that are currently being offered on promotion: * Personal License - $19.99 (USD) * Family License - $39.99 * Business License - starting from $99.99 * IT-Consultant License - starting from $49.99 DriveDx can be purchased from the BinaryFruit website or through the Mac App Store (Personal license only).

In fact earlier this year during CES 2016, the company unveiled a refreshed lineup of the Notebook 9. However given that we’re reaching the end of the year, some time has passed and if you wanted another hardware refresh, you’ll be happy to learn that Samsung has obliged. In an announcement on its website, Samsung has revealed a refreshed lineup of the Notebook 9 laptops. The refresh isn’t particularly major so don’t expect any major overhauls to its design or hardware components. Instead Samsung has given the laptop a more subtle revamp in its design by curving its edges more, introducing slimmer bezels for its display, and giving the keyboard a similar color scheme to the laptop. It will also feature Intel’s latest processors, so if you’re trying to futureproof yourself as much as you can, this is one way to do it. The laptops will be offered in a 13.3-inch and 15-inch options. Regardless of display size, the resolution is at 1920×1080, so in reality the 13.3-inch option should be sharper. Both laptops will support up to 256GB of SSD storage and up to 16 GB of RAM (for the i7 model). There is also a built-in fingerprint sensor for additional security, and will run on Windows 10 with support for Windows Hello. Unfortunately there is no word on pricing or availability just yet.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search VR trends to look out for in 2017 JC Torres - Dec 19, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Virtual reality, or VR for short, is already being hailed as the next wave in computing, but it’s still a few iterations away from becoming as commonplace as mobile devices, which is the current wave of computing. That said, proponents and advocates of VR continue to push the envelop in order to drive this fledgling market. Though delayed by a few months, VR was off to a great start this year. In 2017, we expect it to get over its teething pains and present a more mature image to consumers. Just how that’s going to happen has been laid out by our crystal ball, and here’s how it goes. Explosion of 360-degree content Already we’re seeing dozens of 360-degree videos popping up, covering both tech and non-tech events. While these have mostly been pushed by tech companies, we’re bound to see a surge in such videos coming from anybody and everybody. 360-degree videos will be the new selfie with the coming of affordable 360-degree cameras, either as independent accessories or attachments or smartphones. Just as, in the beginning, few were concerned about the quality of front-facing cameras, so too will few be too obsessed with relatively low res 360-degree photos and videos, as long as they’re cheap to make. A few smartphones and social networking sites, YouTube and Facebook included, already support 360 degree content, and that number will only increase in the coming months. Games will dominate Let’s face it. Until the day VR becomes as commonplace as mobile, people will continue associating it with games. And that’s fine as well. Games are usually great at pushing the boundaries of technology, especially when it comes to high frame rate graphics. The VR experiences being released today are only the tip of the iceberg. Consider them tech demos, if you wish. It won’t be surprising to see first-person shooters proliferating in this arena, but, with a little imagination, more can be made beyond roller coaster simulators. Card battle games, for example, is ripe for the picking. Old-school RPG like Might & Magic are also begging for a VR remake. Mobile VR: poor man’s VR Pushing virtual reality to the forefront of computing requires making it more accessible to the masses. Current “serious” VR rigs, however, are anything but. That mass VR adoption will come via what else but our smartphones. VR viewers do exist today, partly in thanks to Google Cardboard’s push for cheap peripherals. Sadly, those are but a far cry from what VR is truly capable of. With a more capable Daydream platform and viewer, there is a chance that accessory makers will also make the switch to headsets that at least have some modicum of control, like a remote control. That, in turn, will make VR on mobile more than just a simple demo, which will raise the stakes for VR as a whole. And as smartphones continue to close the gap between phone and computer, and with resolutions hitting 2K or even 4K marks, these computers in our pockets become even more capable of running more substantial VR experiences than ever before. More portable VR No, this isn’t a repeat of the above. Currently, VR systems like the Vive, Oculus, or PlayStation tether you in more ways than one. They physically connect you to computers or consoles via cables. Or, at the very least, they require rigs that need to be located in one place alone, usually indoors. Next year, VR will start to break free of those chains in two ways. The first is something we’ve already seen in development: VR backpacks. These are practically gaming-ready, desktop-grade PCs stuffed inside a backpack. It might not be the brightest idea at times, as it could encourage dangerous VR behavior, but it offers more freedom of movement compared to VR setups today. Alternatively, VR headsets will also become wireless. Intel has already demonstrated that possibility. With the push for more consumer-friendly VR products, the need for a more comfortable headset becomes even greater. In the future, you might not even need such a VR backpack, just your VR ready gaming laptop and a wireless HMD. Let’s get social Virtual reality is both an immersive technology as well as an isolating one. By nature, it occludes anything outside of the display in front of the user’s eyes, a limitation addressed by another synthetic reality technology. While it does place you virtually in the middle of the action, you do so alone. At least physically alone. And yet, VR has the potential to become a hub for social interactions. It could make something like Facebook a thing of the past. Or rather, it could become “Facebook 2.0”, so to speak. Virtual worlds, where users are represented by avatars, not necessarily in their own image and likenesss, could give an even more personal flavor to social networking. A virtual world like Second Life, for example, bcomes even more “real” seen through the eyes of VR. And where social goes, users, and money, usually follow. Input needed All these, however, are dependent on one critical development in VR technology: input. Compared to displays, input in VR is a tad harder to get right. It needs the right combination of technology and design to become even approachable. Cardboard, which lacked significant input methods, is an example of how things go wrong. But even the wands more sophisticated VR systems are simply an approximation of an ideal control system for VR. The instinct of most people who experience VR or AR for the first time is to reach out for objects, betraying what ordinary people come to expect of such technology. It’s not easily feasible, however, with current technology. VR gloves are far from being easily accessible, not to mention comfortable to wear. But 2017 will be marked by an increased focus in figuring that out, if not from mainstream companies like HTC and Oculus, then from dreamers and makers. One foot in AR Ironically, VR’s future might actually lie outside of itself. There are definitely legit use cases for VR, when content must be experienced without the rest of the world intruding into view. But often, VR is quite limiting and could use an injection of real world objects. And, indeed, there are some movement from the VR front to include some elements of augmented reality into VR, without exactly going overboard and totally into AR territory. That usually involves sensors and cameras, smokes and mirrors, but the end result is the same: a cohesive, mixed reality experience. Wrap-up It’s still not certain if virtual reality is just a lingering fad or if it has the strength to be a long-lasting technology that will embed itself into our future lives. It definitely has a lot of potential, and we’ve barely scratched its surface. As much as it is a wish list or prediction, these very same points are the matters that the nascent VR industry will have to address if the technology is to take root and truly become the next computing frontier.

Browse more... BlackBerry opens a research center for self-driving tech in Canada Posted Dec 19, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Xura buys Mitel Mobility for $385M and Ranzure to double down on 5G A former smartphone powerhouse wants to be an instrumental part of the coming smart car revolution, and BlackBerry is deepening its investment int he field with a new autonomous driving research center opening for business on Monday in Ottawa, Reuters reports. BlackBerry is one of three initial organizations to get clearance from the government of Ontario to test self-driving vehicles in the province on public roads. BlackBerry’s bet on self-driving is mainly riding on QNX, the company it acquired in 2010, and whose software later became the basis for its BlackBerry 10 mobile operating system. QNX had been a part of Harman International at the time, and was focused on infotainment system software even back then. For its initial tests, BlackBerry will be using Ford Lincoln vehicles retrofitted with autonomous vehicle hardware and software, and the former smartphone maker also has an agreement in place with Ford to work with it directly, with an expanded mandate that includes not only infotainment, but also security software and likely also autonomous driving features, though neither BlackBerry nor ford are getting quiet so specific about their work together just yet. BlackBerry may be able to ride the interest in self-driving tech to renewed relevance, but it’s also going to face a lot of competition. At the software level, companies like Delphi are looking to provide production-ready autonomous hardware and software to automakers, and a number of other players are also in the space, including chipmakers like Qualcomm (through NXP), Intel and Nvidia, and while these companies focus on hardware, they’re also developing software that they could end up supplying to push sales of their primary business. The new research facility will be an extension of BlackBerry’s existing QNX operations in Ottawa, and will also focus on advanced driver assist features like automatic emergency breaking and intelligent cruise as well as development of full autonomy. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Happy New Year from Crunch Report!

Here's how it'll get there Comcast wants in on your smart home. Here's how it'll get there The cable company wants to be known for more than delivering "The Walking Dead" as it pushes its own products for smart homes. Smart Home by Roger Cheng December 19, 2016 5:00 AM PST @RogerWCheng by David Priest December 19, 2016 5:00 AM PST @david_p_priest Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home The Xfinity Home hub gives you full touchscreen control over your home. Photo by Comcast When Fraser Stirling was 16, his father asked him what he wanted to study in school. His answer: industrial design. His father, who's been an assistant principal and a soccer coach, wasn't pleased. "[He] said that was not a proper job for a man in his house," Stirling recalled in a thick Scottish accent. "He wanted me to get a job where I could actually make some money." Twenty years later, Stirling is in charge of designing products for the unlikeliest of companies: Comcast. Yes, the nation's largest cable company, known for delivering "The Walking Dead" to your TV and making you wait hours for a repair technician, is (kinda) entering the hardware business. Comcast has unveiled its first family of products specifically designed by the company to serve its Xfinity Home business. Related stories Comcast expands into home security biz AT&T opens the door to its smart home platform to Samsung, LG, Qualcomm AT&T Digital Life review The focus on design comes as Comcast is amping up the business of automating your whole home -- a contrarian approach in a market largely aimed at DIY enthusiasts piecing together their own smart home setups. Comcast is instead going after mainstream customers who don't have the time or desire to fiddle with touchscreen-controlled deadbolts and their finicky apps. The cost for this convenience is a contractual monthly fee instead of a larger one-time fee. Comcast has no aspirations to go after the likes of Apple or Samsung when it comes to slick products sold by the millions. And it's still working with partners to actually build its devices. But by putting resources behind design and not just using something off the shelf, Comcast hopes to establish an identity that goes beyond a basic cable company. And, hopefully, surprise some people. "What do you want people to feel when they pick it up?" Stirling said in an interview last week. "We want to drive the idea that this is a premium product." A design identity Comcast launched its Xfinity Home service in 2011, but hasn't been particularly vocal about the business. It has used security as the primary hook, with the intent to sell you on additional automation services. Under the Xfinity umbrella, you'll find the Home xCam, Home Wireless Keypad, Home Motion Sensor and Home Door and Window Sensor. The sharp angles of the Motion Sensor allow it to be placed flush against two walls. Photo by Comcast The products have a unique look. Stirling employs sharp 35- to 40-degree angles in the manner of triangles and even parallelograms, which he said lends a sense of motion to static objects. They share the same "Comcast white" color scheme. Stirling, who previously worked for Intel on its ill-fated TV set-top box business and spent a decade at Sky UK (then known as British Sky Broadcasting), said his goal is for someone to look at his products and go, "You know what, somebody thought about that." The consistent look reinforces the idea that this is a single package of products and services, rather than the early-adopter model of a piecemeal system. Comcast isn't the first to do this, but it is one of the biggest service providers to get into this business. The Comcast pitch Comcast relies on two strengths to distinguish it from the DIY market: lower upfront costs and professional, pain-free installation. In exchange, users pay a monthly fee -- the service starts at $40 a month, with 24-hour recording an additional $10 -- and sign a two-year contract. "We have knowledge and expertise to drive this into the wide mass market," said Daniel Herscovici, head of Comcast's Xfinity Home business, in an interview. AT&T Digital Life offers a similar service that also pitches the same service, using security as primary hook.Photo by CNET As of the first quarter of 2015, it had 500,000 customers, although it now claims to be the fastest-growing home security company in its regions. It's hardly alone in hoping to cash in on the smart home boom. There are 6.4 billion connected devices around the world in use this year, and the volume is projected to more than triple to 20.8 billion by 2020, according to Gartner. Many of those devices will be in the home. Elements of the Xfinity Home package will remind you of AT&T's Digital Life, another massive service provider trying to hook you with the idea of convenience over the pain of installation and maintenance. Herscovici said the two compete in less than half of their respective markets. AT&T declined to comment on Comcast. Not for everyone Younger consumers, however, may not find the offer so compelling. After all, it means waiting for an installer to show up, dealing with service contracts and committing to services for years at a time. DIYers could take the one-time financial hit and install their own custom systems, employing setups that work with Apple's HomeKit or Google Home. August's latest Smart Lock gives Siri the keys to your house The $229 Apple-HomeKit-enabled August Smart Lock gives Siri control over your front door. by Megan Wollerton 1:19 Close Drag Both Comcast and AT&T partner with a number of smart home device makers like August for door locks or GE for lightbulbs, which bridges the gap between the DIY approach and the managed service model. Comcast's pending acquisition of Icontrol Networks could open the door to partnerships with more specialized developers. Icontrol's flagship product, a smart cam called the Piper NV, was notable for its ability to communicate using the Z-Wave protocol -- a radio technology that many devices popular among DIYers use to talk with each other. But for now, Comcast has tight control over its family of products, with just a few "trusted" partners. As for the products of its own design, home security is just the start. Stirling's fingerprints will be on future Comcast hardware. That's enough to earn his father's respect. "He thinks it's magic," Stirling said. Correction, 6:39 a.m. PT: Fixes Fraser Stirling's name.

Check out their risks Enjoy — but first strengthen your passwords, update the software and read all that fine print By Ramona Pringle, for CBC News Posted: Dec 19, 2016 5:00 AM ET Last Updated: Dec 19, 2016 5:00 AM ET Before you power up that internet-connected device that Santa Claus is bringing you, don't forget to read the fine print. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters) About The Author Ramona Pringle Technology Columnist Ramona Pringle is an assistant professor in the RTA School of Media and director of the Transmedia Zone at Ryerson University. She is a CBC contributor who writes and reports on the relationship between people and technology. Related Stories Yahoo hackers threaten to reveal you still have a Yahoo email address Ho! Ho! No! Don't let online thieves steal your holiday joy Next year's Ontario literacy test will be paper-only as investigation into cyber attack continues Could hackers shut down Presto card like they did to San Francisco's transit system? San Francisco transit system hijacked by ransomware attack External Links National Cyber Security Alliance (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) It's Christmas morning. You unwrap the shiny paper, and there, in front of you, is the gadget you just knew you needed to have. The one that would make your life easier, better, more convenient. Maybe it's a camera that sends a live feed to your phone and alerts you when it detects motion. Maybe it's a smart TV or, if you're an epicure, a smart fridge. Or it's a smart toy— a coveted talking doll or AI-powered dinosaur. Whether it's on your own holiday wish list or your shopping list for someone else, chances are someone in your family is getting a connected gadget — part of the internet of things — this holiday season. In the holiday exuberance and new-gift euphoria, in can be tempting to rush past the fine print. But before you dash to power up your new fitness tracker or connected thermostat, make sure you're taking the right steps to keep your device secure and your personal information safe. According to a recent survey by the National Cyber Security Alliance, more than one-third of all holiday gift givers plan to purchase a connected device this year. But people are still a little fuzzy about what the risks are and how to protect themselves. Giving or receiving a smart TV or other electronic device this holiday season? Make sure you're taking the right steps to keep your device secure and your personal information safe. (Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press) Half of all consumers are unsure whether they've taken the right security precautions or even what those steps might be. The risk that usually motivates people to strengthen their passwords or update their software is the possibility of someone gaining access to their personal data. If your passwords are weak, a hacker could access your files and snoop through emails or other personal information. That raises concerns over the potential for identity theft and the financial repercussions. Transit system hijackedby ransomware Beyond the obvious information that our devices store, such as name, address, email and credit card information, household smart devices also save telling clues about your activity that you may not want the wrong person knowing. A connected thermostat can give you more control over the temperature of your home and help cut your heating bill, but it can also create a log of details such as what time you leave for work and when you're on vacation. Beware malware Then there's the risk of smart devices being infected with malware and used without our knowledge in a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, like the one that took down almost half the internet in the United States this fall. Despite these risks, we all have more urgent things to do than read over terms of service and security statements — deadlines to meet before the office empties out for the holidays, cookies to bake and presents to wrap. So, quickly, here's what you need to know. Devices are different Not all smart devices are created equal. Cheap, mass produced cameras and baby monitors were the culprits in the recent DDoS attack that took down Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and many other major websites. As Intel points out, some gadgets have weak security standards. Others lack any security standards at all. While everyone loves a bargain, beware of brands you've never heard of that make no mention of security. Reset the password One of the biggest problems is a password that cannot be reset. That essentially means someone else has more control over the device than you do. First things first — change the default user name and password. Passwords should be strong and unique to each device, app or service. Password managers can help create and manage strong passwords across all your devices and accounts. Use safe Wi-Fi Smart devices need a Wi-Fi connection. Make sure your Wi-Fi not only is password protected, but also has a complex password, as all your devices should. Update the software Often, a new device will have updates waiting as soon as you take it out of the box. So when you turn on your device for the first time, check to see if there are updates you need to install. Ask the internet It's worth a quick Google search to see what other people think of the product. Some of the biggest criticism for connected consumer devices, aside from having weak security in the first place, is that vulnerabilities are not made apparent at the point of sale. The packaging doesn't tell you what the potential risks are. So, before you head to the checkout, read online reviews for the connected device you're considering. They will raise red flags about past security beaches and provide information the packaging doesn't reveal, such as having a password that can't be reset.

Melchert Noteworthy Locomotives One of the most noteworthy locomotives in the history of the railroad was the Alco 2-8-2 (Mikado) locomotive. Six of these large locomotives, commonly referred to as “Mikes” for short, were purchased between 1937 and 1939, putting the GB & W on a par with the large first class railroads in terms of locomotive power. These heavy new locomotives required heavier rails and upgraded bridges, but they enabled the GB & W to pull longer trains with more tonnage at higher speeds. They served the railroad well during World War II with the demands of heavier freight traffic. However, time marches on, and the age of steam was nearing the end. The other most noteworthy locomotive, in this writer’s opinion, was the Alco FA 1 diesel. Five of these locomotives were purchased between 1947 and 1949, truly placing the Green Bay and Western into the modern age of railroading. Many rail enthusiasts would argue that these FA diesels were the most handsome diesels ever built, but more importantly, they were efficient. What they did was silence steam forever on the GB & W. Although recently overhauled, the six “Mikes” were retired, and by 1950 the GB & W was completely dieselized, making the railroad one of the first in the U.S. to rely completely on diesel power. The Closing of the Depot in Seymour The original depot was constructed in 1873, and the current depot was built in 1915, making it 101 years old at this writing. It was the center of railroad freight activity in Seymour for more than sixty years, and now houses the Seymour Model Railroad Club. Due to competition from other forms of transportation, new technology, and other factors, by the 1970s the Green Bay and Western decided to close depots, including the one in Seymour. However, since the depot agent, Carl Pintsch, was a valued employee, whose seniority date was October 3, 1929, the GB & W felt an obligation to Mr. Pintsch to keep the depot open until he retired. Carl Pintsch’s last day was Friday, June 27, 1975. When the last train went through, Carl was confused as he received another order from the dispatcher. When he finished taking it down he was speechless. Train order #18 read: “Please accept this train order as our acknowledgement and appreciation for the many years of diligent, cooperative, and faithful service you have rendered to the Green Bay and Western Railway Co. May you enjoy many years of health and happiness in your retirement. Our best wishes to you and your family on this occasion”. Signed ( President H. Weldon McGee and all the officers of the GB & W). After this date all railroadfreight business in Seymour was handled through the Norwood yard office in Green Bay, and trucks from that office handled deliveries to Seymour businesses. The Final Years As freight traffic on the railroad continued to decline, the railroad was sold to the Intel Corporation in 1978. The last straw, so to speak, was the cessation of rail car ferry service across Lake Michigan to Kewaunee in 1990, and the railroad was sold in 1993 to the Wisconsin Central Railroad to form a new subsidiary railroad, the Fox Valley and Western. By 1999 rail traffic through Seymour had decreased to the point where service was discontinued. The last train through Seymour was reportedly in July of 1999. One hundred and twenty-seven years of railroad service to Seymour had ended, and in 2001 the Wisconsin Central was purchased by the Canadian National Railroad. As with many, if not most towns and cities, Seymour was shaped and influenced by the railroad. How could it be any different with the railroad being the lifeblood of existence for well over one hundred years? Hopefully, this brief glimpse into the past will bring back memories for some, and for everyone a greater appreciation for the impact the railroad had on the development and growth of Seymour and similar communities. Locomotive Alco 2-8-2 put the Seymour Railroad on par with other train railroads as their power enabled these engines to pull heavier loads. – Submitted photo Post navigation ← News from the Outagamie County Executive Seymour grad returns home to assist local law firm → Search Search for: NOAA Weather Green Bay, Austin Straubel International Airport, WI Last Updated on Jan 2 2017, 7:53 pm CST Weather by NOAA Current Conditions: Light Rain Temp: 35°F Wind: NE at 15mph Humidity: 93% Windchill: 25°F Your 5-Day Forecast at a Glance BUSINESS LISTINGS ADVERTISER COMMUNITY NEWS AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY APPLE VALLEY NURSERY BAYLAKE BANK BEYOND HORIZONS REALTY LLC CITY OF SEYMOUR COMMUNITY CARE RESOURCES COMMUNITY FIRST CREDIT UNION COONEN'S QUICK STOP – SHELL DOERSCH GARAGE DOOR SALES & SERVICE DON'S QUALITY MARKET FREEDOM FOODS GENERAL DENTISTRY OF SEYMOUR GOOD SHEPHERD SERVICES GUSTMAN'S OF SEYMOUR JEZESKI ACCOUNTING JJ'S AUTO CLINIC MC MULLIGAN'S PUB MENARDS MUEHL BOETTCHER FUNERAL HOME ONE CHOICE WIRELESS ONEIDA OCIFS OUTAGAMIE COUNTY FAIR ASSOC.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 18, 2016December 18, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Better Buy: NVIDIA Corporation vs. Broadcom Image Source: Getty Images. As we hurdle toward the finish line, 2016 will go down as a uniquely active year in the semiconductor market. Spurred on by the onset of several generational tech trends — the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and the like — major semiconductor companies have gone on a buying spree to prepare them to cash-in on this growth. Two such names that sit smack dab in the middle of these growth markets are NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , whose shares have handily outperformed their benchmark over the past five years. AVGO data by YCharts . Both NIVIDIA and Broadcom are attractive in their own right, but which semiconductor stock is the better buy today? In this article, we’ll run both stocks through a three-part gauntlet to see if one is more deserving of investors’ attention. 1. Financial fortitude The first prism through which we’ll analyze these semiconductor stocks is the strength of their balance sheets. Though their investment theses lie in their revenue and profit growth stories, investors need to understand a given company’s financial strength in any investment scenario. In looking at NVIDIA and Broadcom, though, both companies appear fine for the most part. A few important distinctions emerge, however. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio NVIDIA $6.6 billion $2.9 billion $7.4 billion 4.1x Broadcom $2.0 billion $15.0 billion $3.4 billion 2.3x Data Source: NVIDIA & Broadcom Investor Relations, Yahoo! Finance. To get this out of the way, NVIDIA is the clear winner in every category here. NVIDIA has more cash and liquid assets on hand, carries less debt, and generates more cash flow from its core business. There’s really no way around this or disputing it. However, the important nuance in comparing the two companies is that Broadcom’s financial position isn’t a negative either, especially given the company’s intelligent acquisition strategy (see Part 2 below). Simply stated, Broadcom, along with its pre-merger counterpart Avago, has been one of the most prolific acquirers of semiconductor companies, a part of the broader trend of rapid consolidation we’ve seen within the chip industry. In fact, Avago funded part of last year’s transformational merger with Broadcom by issuing $9 billion in fresh debt. The combined company is undeniably stronger as a result of the Broadcom-Avago merger and other recent acquisitions, so Broadcom’s current debt burden is most appropriately viewed as the cost of the company’s transformation into a company poised to dominate the Internet of Things chip market in coming years. Winner: NVIDIA. 2.  Durable competitive advantages Unlike the above section, it’s far harder to determine which company holds stronger competitive advantages. Simply said, both companies are enviably positioned to dominate their markets for years to come. Broadcom’s area of focus is connectivity. The company operates four reporting segments — wired infrastructure, wireless communication, enterprise storage, and industrial and other — that help make our increasingly connected world tick. Its chips appear in smartphones, cellular base stations, Internet of Things devices like smart appliances, data centers, and more. The company’s semiconductors touch multiple points of the connectivity value chain, as well, which is fantastic news given the unprecedented growth opportunity the IoT presents. According to Ericsson , the number of IoT connected devices is set to grow from 4.2 billion to 14.2 billion by 2021, and Broadcom’s offerings will be selling directly into this trend from a place of market leadership. As such, there’s little doubt that investors should love Broadcom’s competitive stance at present. As enviable as Broadcom’s competitive positioning is, though, graphics chip leader NVIDIA’s competitive advantages are every bit as compelling. Akin to Intel ‘s dominance of the CPU microprocessors that power PCs, NVIDIA is the undeniable leader in the high-end graphics chips that lie at the heart of growth markets like self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In fact, NVIDIA’s chips power the budding AI or cloud platforms for Amazon , Facebook , Alphabet , IBM , and Microsoft . Its chips also underpin the self-driving car efforts of Tesla , Audi , Baidu , and many more. It’s for this reason that analysts see NVIDIA’s earnings per share compounding at a 28% annual clip over the next five years, and there’s a legitimate case to be made that Wall Street still underappreciates NVIDIA’s growth story. Winner: Tie. 3.  Valuation When it comes to valuation, the case becomes somewhat more clear cut. As you can see below, NVIDIA is priced for meaningful growth, deservedly so as we learned from the section above. However, Broadcom’s valuation multiple is more appealing, though a bit harder to gain a sense of as the result of some merger-related accounting. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA NVIDIA 63.0x 35.8x 25.9x Broadcom 15.7x 12.5x 16.3x Data Source: S&P CapIQ. In the past three quarters, Broadcom has booked $1.5 billion in non-cash merger-related charges, which has artificially depressed its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings. In backing those charges out, the company’s normalized earnings per share for 2016 come to $10.84 per share, a very reasonable price for a company with Broadcom’s positive growth outlook. Winner: Broadcom. Putting it all together Both NVIDIA and Broadcom sit at the middle of some of the most important growth markets in tech today. As such, each company should experience impressive sales and profit growth in the coming years. If we’re splitting hairs here, you can make a plausible case that Broadcom’s lower valuation makes it the better bet. However, the more important big-picture takeaway is that both NVIDIA and Broadcom are fantastic options for investors looking to participate in the next wave of semiconductor market growth. 10 stocks we like better than Broadcom When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The S&P 500 stock index has surged over 8 per cent since the November 8 election, due in large part to sectors that are expected to benefit from an inflationary policy. The S&P financial sector has led the charge, with a gain of more than 17 per cent. “We are putting fuel on the fire here potentially, because nothing has actually happened, everybody is acting like it is already happening,” said Richard Bernstein, Chief Executive Officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. Those expectations, along with improving economic data and the US Federal Reserve’s recent decision to raise interest rates while signalling a quicker pace of hikes next year, have also served to strengthen the dollar and push bond yields higher. It is the rising dollar that risks undercutting the earnings of large multinational firms, just when the overall earnings from S&P 500 companies were ending an earnings recession in the latest quarter. And while rising bond yields may be beneficial to banks, they lift the overall cost of capital for companies and shrink the relative valuation advantage stocks have had over fixed income investments since the financial crisis. “The thought is that earnings will be better and the economy is strong enough to be able to withstand higher interest rates, and that is why we’re not seeing a decline in stocks,” said Paul Nolte, Portfolio Manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “That being said, the stronger dollar and higher interest rates will at some point filter through to earnings. It’s just a matter of when and how.” The dollar hit a 14-year high of 103.56 against a basket of major currencies following the Fed’s announcement on Wednesday. Stocks also appear to be getting pricey, with the current price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 at 20.8, well above its long-term average of 16.6, according to Thomson Reuters data. Higher bond yields is also increasing bonds’ attractiveness over equities. The S&P 500 dividend yield is 2.07 per cent versus a yield of almost 2.6 per cent for the benchmark 10-year US Treasury after its sixth straight week of gains. “That is a big valuation disconnect, that will continue to keep people invested in bonds,” said Greg Peters, Senior Investment Officer at PGIM Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey. These twin challenges for equities could be mitigated, however, should the economy continue to improve. A climb in rates and the dollar are hallmarks of economic growth, provided the increases happen at a steady pace. “This economy is in good shape in our view,” said Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. “So, rates are rising for the right reasons and the economy is proving that, and that should be a potential positive for equities.” US STOCKS: The S&P 500 and the Dow were little changed in early afternoon trading on Friday, but the Nasdaq was dragged down by a fall in technology shares. The Dow is on track for its sixth weekly gain and less than 1 per cent away from 20,000, a level it has never breached. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates for the second time in nearly a decade on Wednesday, sees a faster pace of rate hikes in 2017, partly due to the potential economic benefits from President-elect Donald Trump’s policies. US stocks have been on a tear since the November 8 presidential election, with the S&P rising 5.7 per cent on bets that Trump’s plans to deregulate sectors and increase infrastructure spending will boost the economy. “We’re at a point where there’s not much to factor in,” said Mohannad Aama, Managing Director at Beam Capital Management in New York. “You had the Trump rally, and then you had the anticipation about what the Fed was going to say. For the next two weeks, we have somewhat of an aimless market, where people are getting ready to close the books for the year.” However, there are some concerns that the “Trump rally” may have gone too far too soon and that valuations are stretched. The S&P 500 is trading at 17.9 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. At 12:34 pm ET (1734 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial average was up 12.23 points, or 0.06 per cent, at 19,864.47. The S&P 500 was down 1.19 points, or 0.05 per cent, at 2,260.84. The Nasdaq Composite was down 5.88 points, or 0.11 per cent, at 5,450.98. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the utility index’s 1.37 per cent rise leading the gainers. The technology sector fell 0.66 per cent, weighed down by Oracle and Intel, which fell 1.5 per cent fall. Oracle dropped 4.2 per cent to $36.59 after the business software maker’s adjusted revenue missed analysts’ estimates. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P. Chipotle Mexican Grill rose 1.9 per cent to $389.83 after the company, under pressure from activist investor Bill Ackman, appointed four more members to its board. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,856 to 1,026. On the Nasdaq, 1,640 issues rose and 1,113 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 21 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 143 new highs and 24 new lows.— Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Maduro delays removing currency bills amid crisis, protests Scotland says to unveil single market Brexit plan → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Govt units to submit revised payrolls Ministry mulls private investment in public schools Municipal Council heads in Governorates take oath Municipal Council Chief takes oath Read More ...

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will attend the launch by the Waterloo, Ontario-based smartphone pioneer, the prime minister's office said on Sunday. A Blackberry spokeswoman deferred any comment on the project until Monday. Blackberry, once known for its phones but now betting its future on the more profitable business of making software and managing mobile devices after largely ceding the smartphone market to the likes of Apple and Samsung, is expanding subsidiary QNX's Ottawa facility to focus on developing advanced driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technology. After a detour where QNX's industrial-focused software was used to reinvent the now-discarded BlackBerry phone operating system, BlackBerry is focused on how its embedded software interacts with the explosion of sensors, cameras and other components required for a car to drive itself. But while deep-pocketed Silicon Valley has invested heavily in the artificial intelligence and machine learning required for autonomy, more financially-constrained BlackBerry has not, eyeing instead a niche role as a trusty sidekick. "What QNX is doing is providing the infrastructure that allows you to build higher-level algorithms and to also acquire data from the sensors in a reliable manner," said Sebastian Fischmeister, a University of Waterloo associate professor who has worked with QNX since 2009. "Our play in this is that we provide the software foundation for these high-performance compute platforms," QNX head John Wall said in an interview on Friday . BlackBerry and the university's research teams got the green light to test Ford Motor Co Lincoln vehicles with autonomous features on Ontario's public roads late last month. The company has also inked a deal to work directly with the Detroit-based carmaker as it works to get fleets of robot ride-sharing vehicles to market by 2021. Wall said the company is in advanced discussions with "more than one or two" other major global automakers about similar partnerships, but also cautioned that the hype of robot cars would take a long time to be fully realized. QNX already powers infotainment and telematics systems in millions of cars, giving an option to automakers watching the speed at which firms such as Tesla Motors Inc, ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc, and Alphabet Inc's Google have advanced their self-driving projects. "If they can prove that they have the whole package and the security, they could absolutely dominate the market" for autonomous vehicle operating systems, said Sam Fiorani, an analyst at Auto Forecast Solutions. Risks remain, including the challenge from chipmakers such as Intel Corp who, eyeing demand for their processors in future robot cars, could discount or give away their own security and safety software in order to sell more hardware. "Some of these companies can afford to lose a lot of money in their pursuit of adoption and market share," said Chris Rommel, who leads embedded technology research at VDC Research.

be software-based or hard-ware based, and it is dependent on the organizations' security needs and their IT budgets. Software-based encryption is carried out with the help of software to encrypt and decrypt data stored in the files/folders, hard drives, removable media, data travelling over the internet network through emails, etc. Encryption software use specific algorithms to convert data into a meaningless cipher text or encrypted text, which can only be converted to meaningful text using key, symmetric key (single key) or asymmetric key (pair of keys). Different encryption algorithms are available for symmetric and asymmetric keys. The most widely used algorithms under symmetric key are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple-DES, and Blowfish. Similarly for asymmetric key, the most commonly used algorithm is RSA. Regulatory frame work set by the governments about data privacy and compliance demands tighter security measures. With stringent regulations, the need for effective data security technologies is vital. While developed geographies such as America and Europe already have federal level regulations that require mandatory compliance with data privacy laws; however, developing regions such as APAC and LAMEA, are in the process of implementing more concrete data protection legislations. Based on the Application type, the Encryption Software market is segmented into Disk Encryption, File/Folder Encryption, Database Encryption, Communication Encryption and Cloud Encryption. Based on Organization Size, the market is segmented into Small & Medium Sized Enterprises and Large Enterprises. Based on deployment Type, the market is segmented into cloud based and On-premise. The Verticals highlighted in this report include BFSI, Healthcare, Government & Public Utilities, Telecom, Retail, Aerospace & Defence and Others. Based on region, Encryption Software market is segmented into North America (US, Canada, Mexico and Rest of North America), Europe (Germany, UK, France, Russia, Spain, Italy and Rest of Europe), Asia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Rest of Asia-Pacific) and Latin America, and Middle East & Africa. North America remained the dominant region in the global Encryption Software market in 2015. Asia-Pacific would witness promising CAGR during the forecast period (2016-2022). The report covers the analysis of key stake holders of the Encryption Software market. Key companies profiled in the report include Symantec Corporation, Check Point Software Technologies, IBM Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Intel Corporation, HP Enterprise Company, FireEye, Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, AT&T Inc. and Dell Inc.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo By Alastair Sharp | OTTAWA OTTAWA Canada's BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) will open an autonomous driving research center on Monday, as it tries to make itself an indispensable under-the-hood piece of the automotive industry's weaponry in the self-driving vehicle arms race. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will attend the launch by the Waterloo, Ontario-based smartphone pioneer, the prime minister's office said on Sunday. A Blackberry spokeswoman deferred any comment on the project until Monday. Blackberry, once known for its phones but now betting its future on the more profitable business of making software and managing mobile devices after largely ceding the smartphone market to the likes of Apple and Samsung, is expanding subsidiary QNX's Ottawa facility to focus on developing advanced driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technology. After a detour where QNX's industrial-focused software was used to reinvent the now-discarded BlackBerry phone operating system, BlackBerry is focused on how its embedded software interacts with the explosion of sensors, cameras and other components required for a car to drive itself. But while deep-pocketed Silicon Valley has invested heavily in the artificial intelligence and machine learning required for autonomy, more financially-constrained BlackBerry has not, eyeing instead a niche role as a trusty sidekick. "What QNX is doing is providing the infrastructure that allows you to build higher-level algorithms and to also acquire data from the sensors in a reliable manner," said Sebastian Fischmeister, a University of Waterloo associate professor who has worked with QNX since 2009. "Our play in this is that we provide the software foundation for these high-performance compute platforms," QNX head John Wall said in an interview on Friday . BlackBerry and the university's research teams got the green light to test Ford Motor Co (F.N) Lincoln vehicles with autonomous features on Ontario's public roads late last month. The company has also inked a deal to work directly with the Detroit-based carmaker as it works to get fleets of robot ride-sharing vehicles to market by 2021. Wall said the company is in advanced discussions with "more than one or two" other major global automakers about similar partnerships, but also cautioned that the hype of robot cars would take a long time to be fully realized. QNX already powers infotainment and telematics systems in millions of cars, giving an option to automakers watching the speed at which firms such as Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O), ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google have advanced their self-driving projects. "If they can prove that they have the whole package and the security, they could absolutely dominate the market" for autonomous vehicle operating systems, said Sam Fiorani, an analyst at Auto Forecast Solutions. Risks remain, including the challenge from chipmakers such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) who, eyeing demand for their processors in future robot cars, could discount or give away their own security and safety software in order to sell more hardware. "Some of these companies can afford to lose a lot of money in their pursuit of adoption and market share," said Chris Rommel, who leads embedded technology research at VDC Research.

"What QNX is doing is providing the infrastructure that allows you to build higher-level algorithms and to also acquire data from the sensors in a reliable manner," said Sebastian Fischmeister, a University of Waterloo associate professor who has worked with QNX since 2009. "Our play in this is that we provide the software foundation for these high-performance compute platforms," QNX head John Wall said in an interview on Friday . BlackBerry and the university's research teams got the green light to test Ford Motor Co (F.N) Lincoln vehicles with autonomous features on Ontario's public roads late last month. The company has also inked a deal to work directly with the Detroit-based carmaker as it works to get fleets of robot ride-sharing vehicles to market by 2021. Wall said the company is in advanced discussions with "more than one or two" other major global automakers about similar partnerships, but also cautioned that the hype of robot cars would take a long time to be fully realized. QNX already powers infotainment and telematics systems in millions of cars, giving an option to automakers watching the speed at which firms such as Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O), ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google have advanced their self-driving projects. "If they can prove that they have the whole package and the security, they could absolutely dominate the market" for autonomous vehicle operating systems, said Sam Fiorani, an analyst at Auto Forecast Solutions. Risks remain, including the challenge from chipmakers such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) who, eyeing demand for their processors in future robot cars, could discount or give away their own security and safety software in order to sell more hardware. "Some of these companies can afford to lose a lot of money in their pursuit of adoption and market share," said Chris Rommel, who leads embedded technology research at VDC Research.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:40 AM, December 19, 2016 OTTAWA - Canada's BlackBerry Ltd <BB.TO> will open an autonomous driving research center on Monday, as it tries to make itself an indispensable under-the-hood piece of the automotive industry's weaponry in the self-driving vehicle arms race. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will attend the launch by the Waterloo, Ontario-based smartphone pioneer, the prime minister's office said on Sunday. A Blackberry spokeswoman deferred any comment on the project until Monday. Blackberry, once known for its phones but now betting its future on the more profitable business of making software and managing mobile devices after largely ceding the smartphone market to the likes of Apple and Samsung, is expanding subsidiary QNX's Ottawa facility to focus on developing advanced driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technology. After a detour where QNX's industrial-focused software was used to reinvent the now-discarded BlackBerry phone operating system, BlackBerry is focused on how its embedded software interacts with the explosion of sensors, cameras and other components required for a car to drive itself. But while deep-pocketed Silicon Valley has invested heavily in the artificial intelligence and machine learning required for autonomy, more financially-constrained BlackBerry has not, eyeing instead a niche role as a trusty sidekick.
