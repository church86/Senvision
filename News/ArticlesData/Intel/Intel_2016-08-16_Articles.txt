Virtual Reality Intel launches wireless Project Alloy headset for 'merged reality' The company won't make the headsets but will sell the technologies to other firms By Matt Burgess 17 Aug 2016 By Matt Burgess Wednesday 17 August 2016 Intel The increasingly crowded virtual reality market has a new player. Tech giant Intel has unveiled its take on VR with the launch of Project Alloy. ADVERTISEMENT At the company's developer conference in Silicon Valley, the firm's CEO, Brian Krzanich, showed off the new "all-in-one virtual reality solution". Working in "merged reality" the completely wireless headset aims to combine objects in the real-world with those the wearer sees through their headset. The hardware can sense whether a person is about to walk into a wall and show the approaching object through the internal viewer. Read more VR will allow us to live in another world of our own design VR will allow us to live in another world of our own design By Philip Rosedale The technology also uses internal cameras and motion sensors to allow wearers to see their hands – providing the opportunity for interaction with real objects while they're in virtual worlds. At present the HTC Vive allows for movement control with a whole room set-up and Oculus is working on hand controllers for its Rift device. Intel At the core of Intel's Project Alloy is its RealSense technology. First released in 2014, it is able to 3D scan a room in real-time and has since been used to help service robots navigate buildings. ADVERTISEMENT Read more The WIRED World in 2017 The WIRED World in 2017 By Greg Williams In June, WIRED saw how the technology was being developed for VR; a hand stretched in front of the cameras and sensors could be seen on a digital display and interact with objects in pixellated environment. A hand movement could knock a digital object over, or disrupt the water flow of a digital fountain. Intel isn't the only company developing headsets that bring together the physical and digital worlds. Often called 'mixed reality,' Magic Leap, the secretive US startup, is developing digital overlays for environments and has received more than $2 billion in investments – despite not having released a product. Meanwhile Microsoft is creating HoloLens. Intel said the headset is capable of "a free range of motion with 6 degrees-of-freedom across a large space". And, unlike competitors, the developed device is completely wireless and self-contained; no cords are needed to power or input content to the device. ADVERTISEMENT Those hoping to buy the headset will have to wait for some time as Intel isn't going to make the devices. Instead it will offer Project Alloy as an open hardware platform from next year. This means the company will not be selling the headsets itself but will make the technology available to other manufacturers. The hope from Intel is other companies, specialising in VR and augmented reality hardware, will combine its technologies and parts into their own devices. This is in line with previous company statements saying it isn't going to sell its own headsets.

Intel Snaps Up Nervana to Jump-Start AI By David Jones Aug 16, 2016 2:27 PM PT Intel last week announced the acquisition of startup Nervana, in a bid to enhance the company's capabilities in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Nervana jumped out of the gate at its 2014 launch with a robust platform for deep learning, a framework called "Nervana Neon," and the Nervana Engine -- a groundbreaking ASIC chip scheduled for introduction by the first quarter of 2017. Nervana's IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel's capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence, according to Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel's Data Center Group. "We will apply Nervana's software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks," she said. The Nervana Engine and its silicon expertise will advance Intel's AI portfolio, added Bryant, enhancing the deep learning performance and lowering the total cost of ownserhip of its Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors. Rapid Advance "Nervana has developed a unique capability to process data more quickly across various environments, ranging from open source to highly customized computing systems," observed Jeff Kaplan, managing director of ThinkStrategies. "Like in many M&A situations, Intel's acquisition is aimed at quickly obtaining technological innovations, along with the talented team that developed the new solution," he told the E-Commerce Times. That talent pool includes Nervana CEO Naveen Rao, a former Qualcomm researcher with a PhD from Brown University, and CTO Amir Khosrowshahi, among others. The firm has raised more than US$28 million in funding from investors. Nervana earlier this year introduced its Nervana Cloud platform, which the company has described as 10 times faster than competing AI cloud platforms. It allows organizations of various sizes to build and deploy deep learning solutions without having to make large investments in machine learning or data teams. Nervana Cloud customers include Blue River Technologies, which uses agricultural robots along with the Nervana Cloud to boost crop yields, and Paradigm, an oil and gas software developer that uses the cloud platform to help identify subsurface faults embedded in 3D seismic images. The new Nervana Engine chip will be able to handle a high level of data at speeds that its competitors cannot match, according to the company, through incorporation of a new technology called "high bandwidth memory," which combines 32 GB of on-chip storage with memory access speeds of 8 terabits per second. Intel Lagging Intel doesn't have much of a machine learning business at the moment, so it needed to acquire Nervana in order to catch up with the competition in the segment, said Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "They have invested in software, including some open source work," he told the E-Commerce Times, "but anyone doing AI and machine learning R&D or deploying deep learning at scale will use hardware accelerators." Nvidia's GPUs are currently the most favored accelerators in the business, "which has to rankle Intel," Teich said. "Xeon Phi simply didn't move in the right direction. This is reminiscent of Intel putting a lot of investment into a new Itanium 64-bit architecture instead of adding 64-bit instructions to their X86 cores, which AMD eventually did for them," he pointed out. Deep learning takes a "fundamentally different approach than big or little x86 cores," explained Teich. "Intel's software folks saw deep learning coming, but their silicon architecture and design teams did not." David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

The company gave recommendations at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, Lilputing is reporting. OEMs should consider ditching the fan, using MicroSD ports instead of full-sized ones, replacing USB Type-A with the smaller USB Type-C, and putting the circuit board in the middle of the tablet instead of on the sides, to save on internal cables. Related: Nobody wants Intel’s Core M processor, and Computex proves it All that could get things down to 0.27, but the current sweet spot, according to an Intel slide, is 0.31 to 0.37 inches. A quick look at tablets we’ve recently reviewed suggests this is accurate: Acer Switch Alpha 12: 0.59 inches Surface Pro 4: 0.333 inches Lenovo ThinkPad X1 tablet: 0.33 inches Huawei Matebook: 0.27 inches iPad Pro: 0.27 inches The Acer Switch Alpha 12 falls outside Intel’s sweet spot, and from experience we can tell you that it feels bulky. That tablet sports a Core i5 processors, and uses liquid cooling, which of necessity takes up more space. The Matebook, meanwhile, is super thin and light, but is a little short on power, especially considering the price point. Occupying the Goldilocks space outlined by Intel are the Surface Pro 4 and the ThinkPad X1. We feel like both these machines managed to offer a considerable amount of computing heft without sacrificing portability. The goal, then, is for devices like these to eventually fit into the current form factor of the Matebook and the iPad Pro. A few of the suggestions outlined by Intel include: Switching to OLED displays, instead of cheaper, thicker LCDs Single-sided circuit boards Reduce I/O connectors, using USB-C instead Solder cards like Wi-Fi into place, instead of offering replaceable parts What does this all mean for users? That tablets are going to get thinner, but possibly harder to repair. It’s a trade-off for sure, but for now it seems like one the market demands. It will be interesting to see if more OEMs manage to hit 0.27 inches without compromising power, and we’ll let you know when that happens.

This new Intel board is provided in two variations: the Joule 570x packed with a quad-core Intel Atom T5700 “Broxton-M” processor, and the Joule 550x with a quad-core Atom T5500 chip. According to Intel, these two processors promise up to 50-percent better performance than the previous “Cherry Trail” generation. However, consumers likely won’t see these chips in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other popular computing platforms given that Intel is moving to use its “Apollo Lake”-based Celeron and Pentium processors in mobile devices instead. During one of the IDF 2016 sessions provided to developers, the company compared the T5700/T5500 chips to the Atom Z34xx, showing up to 10 times better application performance in the newer processors. The company also compared them to the Atom x5-Z8500, revealing slightly better performance in games using DirectX 9 and OpenGL ES 2.0, better single-thread performance in integer compute intensive applications, and better throughput with multiple threads in the same applications. According to one of the slides, the Atom T5700 processor includes four “Goldmont” cores, a Gen9 Low Power graphics component, an image processing unit, an audio processor, and a security processor. The chip can support up to six cameras, Wireless AC and Bluetooth 4.1 FMR connectivity, Intel’s RealSense Camera ZR300 for developers, LPDDR4 memory, multi-lane PCI Express bus connections, eMMC 5.0 storage, and more. Related: Look ma, no wires! Intel’s Project Alloy gives VR full freedom of movement In an entirely different session, the company showed that its next-generation Atom chips are based on 14nm process technology. The graphics core is capable of 4K encode and decode, and up to three independent displays: 4K at 60Hz via embedded DisplayPort, or 4K at 60Hz through DisplayPort and HDMI. Both chips support Windows 10, Windows 10 IoT Core, Linux, VxWorks, and Android. That all said, Intel said in its original Joule announcement that the Atom T5700 chip has a clock speed of 1.7GHz and a burst clock speed of 2.4GHz. The Atom T5500 chip is a bit slower with a base clock speed of 1.5GHz (the burst speed is unknown at the moment). Processors based on Intel’s Goldmont core architecture have thermal envelopes ranging from six to 12 watts. Looking back on the previous Cherry Trail generation of Atom processors, the new versions are a big improvement. Based on Intel’s “Silvermont” core architecture, the older Atom chips include a Gen8 Low Power graphics component, support for LPDDR3 and DDR3L memory at 1,600MHz, display resolutions up to 3,840 by 2,160 at 30Hz through DisplayPort and HDMI, and eMMC 4.51 storage. However, the newer Atom chips demand more power, as the 2015 chips have thermal envelopes ranging between a mere four and six watts. As previously reported, the Joule 570x will come packed with 4GB of LPDDR4 system memory, 16GB of eMMC storage, interfaces for USB 3.0, MPI CSI and MIMO, Wireless AC/Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity, and a Linux-based operating system fine-tuned for IoT and smart devices. The Joule 550x kit has 3GB of LPDDR4 system memory, 8GB of eMMC storage, and the same features (outside the Atom chip) as the other Joule kit. Both support the Intel RealSense cameras and libraries. Finally, we’ve compiled all the Intel slides related to the two new Atom processors from IDF 2016 in a gallery embedded below.

The new part, currently under the codename of Knights Mill, is being aimed at the deep learning market and is scheduled for release in 2017. At this point there are more unknowns than knowns about Knights Mill, in part because Intel has not offered much detail on how it fits into the larger Xeon Phi brand. The company had previously announced in 2014 that the successor to the current Knights Landing design would be Knights Hill, a true 3rd gen Xeon Phi built on Intel’s 10nm process. However this week there has been no mention of Knights Hill, whether Knights Mill is Knights Hill renamed, or what the manufacturing process Knights Mill is being made on. With that said, as Knights Mill is scheduled for 2017, it’s unlikely that it’s Knights Hill (at least as initially planned), as 2017 would be too early for a very large 10nm chip from Intel’s fabs. Announced In 2014 And Currently MIA: Knights Hill Working on the assumption at the moment that Knights Mill is in fact its own part, what we do know is that with it, Intel is making a very clear play for the rapidly growing machine learning market, and indeed this will be its defining characteristic. Among the features/design tweaks for the new processor, Intel is adding what they are calling “variable precision” support.  What that fully entails isn’t clear, but the use of lower precision modes has been a major factor in the development and subsequent high performance of machine learning-focused processors, so it’s likely that this means that Intel is adding FP16 and possibly other lower-precision modes, something the current Knights Landing lacks. As machine learning typically does not require high precision, these lower precision modes potentially allow for a major increase in processor throughput, as more, narrower operations can be packed into a SIMD. Also on the feature list is improved scale-out performance. It’s not clear right now if this is some kind of fabric/interconnect change, or if Intel has something else in mind. But the ultimate goal is to make clusters of Xeon Phi processors perform better, which is an important factor in bringing down the training time of very large and complex datasets. Meanwhile there are also unspecified memory changes for Knights Mill, with Intel touting the chip’s “flexible, high capacity memory.” Competitively, this is a shot across the bow at NVIDIA’s own Tesla products, and in their comments here at IDF and in previous presentations, Intel has not shied away from comparing their tech to GPUs and touting why they believe Xeon Phi to be superior. One such example, though briefly mentioned, is that like Knights Landing, Knights Mill is capable of acting as a host processor. So expect to see Intel promoting the benefits of not needing separate host processors & co-processors, and how Knights Mill can be attached directly to system RAM. This, along with the performance differences between the GPU architectures and Knights Mill, will undoubtedly be a recurring fight between the two companies both now and next year when the new processor actually launches. In the meantime, we’ll keep digging for more information on Knights Mill, and hopefully get a better idea of how it fits into the Xeon Phi family.

Especially during times where the CEO have stock trades like lets say the CEO sold a thousand shares the week after he lied, that's a pretty big crime. NVIDIA also has certain modes in software that detect when a benchmark is taking place and clock up higher(since they know its a short period of time), but these days every company Samsung, Intel and etc do this to some degree.

More like this Intel's megachips will take on Nvidia's GPUs and Google's TPUs Intel's Knights Mill mega-chip to take on GPUs in A.I. AMD mulls a CPU+GPU super chip in a server reboot Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles In 2009, Intel gave up on developing Larrabee, a homegrown discrete GPU, targeted at PC gaming systems. Now, some analysts are questioning whether Intel needs its own high-performance GPU, a driving force behind the fast-growing gaming, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence markets. GPUs aren't a big presence at the ongoing Intel Developer Forum, which is centered around the chip maker's A.I. and VR strategy. Intel is highlighting its CPUs and FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) for those categories, and the lack of a GPU to chase the hot markets could be a hole in the company's product line. Intel has never been a leader in graphics, and it hasn't aggressively competed in the area, like Nvidia and AMD have. This week, it showed some progress in its graphics technology, saying its upcoming Kaby Lake PC chips will have integrated graphics processors with 4K support. For A.I., Intel is pitching high-performance chips called Xeon Phi, which were derived from Larrabee. At IDF, the company announced a specialized Xeon Phi chip called Knights Mill for A.I. It also pitching FPGAs, which can be reprogrammed for specific machine-learning tasks. With its current chip lineup, Intel doesn't believe it needs a pure-play GPU to pursue its A.I. strategy. "Really, what most high-performance computers need -- they don't need a GPU -- they need parallel application performance, there are many ways to get that," said Jason Waxman, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Center Solutions Group. But in multimedia applications, a homegrown GPU could help. If Intel had highest-performance GPUs like AMD and Nvidia do, the company would be able to participate in a wider capacity in VR and AR, said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. "With what they have now, they can participate in VR and AR all the way from head-mounted displays to mainstream A.I. and VR ... with their CPUs," Moorhead said. But to use VR headsets like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, PCs with Intel CPUs will still need high-end GPUs from Nvidia or AMD. Intel may not need a GPU for A.I. with its Xeon Phi and software stack, but time will tell, Moorhead said. Having one quality GPU to tackle the A.I., gaming, and VR and AR markets could help Intel kill many birds with one stone, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. But the company has already burned a lot of money trying to build a GPU and hasn't seen success, McGregor said. Intel may not have the appetite to make a high-performance GPU, which can be challenging. Moreover, Intel doesn't believe in the idea of a co-processor, or a separate processor, to accelerate certain workloads. It believes in building fully capable host chips that boot up computers and take on all workloads, McGregor said. In the meanwhile, it can turn to AMD, Nvidia, or even Imagination Technologies for its graphics needs, McGregor said. Intel in the past also turned to ARM for graphics on its now-defunct low-end Atom X3 chip code-named Sofia.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Intel enters the drone market 18 August 2016 An unlikely player has announced its entry into the rapidly growing drone market: Intel. According to the company, they will be launching a new "ready to fly" drone in the fourth quarter of this year and that drone will be promoted as a development platform for software developers. At the heart of the drone will be Intel's Aero Compute board, an SBC that uses a quad-core Atom processor and runs a Linux OS. It also supports the AirMap geofencing system and RealSense computer vision technology. From a hardware perspective, this drone is pretty boring and looks more like the sort of thing that a high-school student might come up with rather than the results of an engineer's attention -- but given its intended application that's probably okay. The real question has to be "just why are Intel doing this?" Traditionally, Intel has its roots in the CPU and commercial, industrial and consumer computing component markets so a shift into the realm of unmanned aerial vehicles is not something commentators were expecting. Most of the electronics in commercial and consumer-grade drones are based around ARM processors so perhaps Intel has decided that they need to create a presence before they're left completely out of this lucrative market. Just looking at the specs, the electronics Intel are using (the Aero Compute board) is far more suited to development activities than actual use in any commercial system. It is quite large by modern standards and there are far better options for production-level use. It will be very interesting to see whether developers opt to get on board with this "development kit" drone or if they prefer to stick with the more commonplace ARM-based hardware. This could turn into an embarrassing flop if Intel can't attract the developers it's targeting with this bit of kit. I've not seen a final price for the drone but the Aero board itself is pitched at US$399, which isn't too bad at all. Interestingly enough, Intel has already dipped its toe into the drone market by way of investments in other companies and related technologies. They have a stake in Yuneec, a Chinese company which set out to rival DJI, the recognised world leader in consumer-grade drones. Intel has also invested in several technology startups that have a drone focus. Personally I'm quite excited by this offering, not for what it does but for the potential it has to open the doors for armies of wannabe drone software developers that don't have the smarts to do their own hardware. Who knows what clever software will start appearing next year when this hits the market. One thing is for sure... love them or hate them, it is becoming increasingly clear that drones are the future of aviation (even though certain district councils around here refuse to acknowledge that or take advantage of the opportunities presented them).

Capcom's Street Fighter V installs hidden rootkit on PCs ARM emits Cortex-R52 Despite IANA storm, ICANN shows just why it shouldn't be allowed to take over internet's critical functions IDF16 Intel is working on a powerful Xeon Phi processor for servers and workstations that is "optimized" for artificial-intelligence software – and it's codenamed Knights Mill. Chipzilla's data center group boss Diane Bryant flashed up this slide during this morning's Intel Developer Forum keynote in San Francisco: The chip is geared towards deep-learning applications, and is expected to be available in 2017, we're told. It will use RAM stacked into the top of its die, feature many, many cores, and have a focus on high-performance floating-point calculations – all of which should help it perform the operations necessary for high-throughput machine learning. Crucially, the Mill is not an accelerator or coprocessor: it can run x86 code and can boot and run operating systems and apps without the need of a host CPU. This sets it apart from rival chips, like Nvidia's GPUs, which need a host processor to direct them. According to Intel, Knights Mill "is optimized for scale-out analytics implementations, and will include key enhancements for deep learning training. For today’s machine learning applications, the large memory size of the Intel Xeon Phi processor family helps customers like Baidu make it easier to train their models efficiently." The Mill is the latest in the Xeon Phi family, which keeps growing and growing. Its Knights Hill sister, a third-generation 10nm Phi announced in 2014, will be used in supercomputers, such as the US Department of Energy's forthcoming 180PFLOPS Aurora beast. Meanwhile, Knights Landing, the second-generation 14nm Phi announced in 2013, went on sale in June. It sports up to 72 Atom Airmont cores, and can access up to 16GB of stacked 3D RAM and up to 384GB of normal DDR4 memory – you can find all their specs here. It will be used in Uncle Sam's Cori supercomputer. Before them were Knights Corner and Knights Ferry. The Xeon Phi clan is aimed at high-performance servers and systems, and carry high price tags. A Knights Landing part will set you back at least $2,500. Up until now, they've been touted to academics and government boffins running simulations and material studies and the like. Now, with AI startup Nervana in its pocket, Intel's turning the Phis to artificial intelligence, and Nvidia is in its sights. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 21 Comments More from The Register Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Will Virtual Reality Be Intel's Next Frontier? The chipmaker launches VR headset Project Alloy and announces new customers for its foundry business on the first day of Intel Developer Forum. Jaewon Kang Aug 17, 2016 2:02 PM EDT As chip giant Intel (INTC) continues to search for new sources of growth outside of its legacy PC business, virtual reality may be one of its next big focus areas. On Tuesday, Intel kicked off its three-day Developer Forum in San Francisco. Virtual reality and its foundry business of manufacturing chips for other companies were among the main themes in the first day of the chipmaker's conference. In fact, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker launched VR headset Project Alloy and introduced a new concept it calls merged reality in which users switch back and forth between virtual reality, which offers a computer-generated environment that blocks out the real world, and augmented reality, which adds computer-generated images to the physical world. Intel touts Project Alloy as an all-in-one VR headset that includes sensors, cameras, batteries and a central processing unit. (CPU refers to a type of chip that essentially handles the majority of a computer's calculations.) On the VR software front, Intel will partner with Microsoft (MSFT) with Windows Holographic, the software that powers Microsoft's VR product HoloLens. On the hardware front, it will open-source the Project Alloy hardware to developers in the second half of the year. "Virtual reality is obviously in its early stages," said Northland Securities analyst Tom Sepenzis via phone, adding that while it will take a couple years for the concept to fully develop, it bodes well that Intel is making a push toward VR, espeically as it looks to diversify outside of its core PC business.

After years of research, the chipmaker has begun selling a product using a technology called silicon photonics that builds lasers directly into computer chips. That means communications can take place using light traveling over glass fiber-optic cables that can carry much more data than electrons on traditional copper wires. "We see a future where silicon photonics optical input-output is everywhere in the data center," said Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, at the company's Intel Developer Forum Wednesday in San Francisco. More from IDF 2016 USB Type-C could kill your headphone jack. Here's how ​Intel's next-gen PC chip works, it's the fastest ever, and it's coming this fall Intel strikes deal to make ARM-based chips It's not technology you'll plug into your PC or phone any time soon, but silicon photonics could help you out. That's because data centers packed with thousands of servers are shouldering more and more work -- everything from Facebook's face recognition to Google's language translation. Opening up communication bottlenecks between those servers means new services are economical and existing ones can run faster. Intel's first silicon photonics communication chips can transfer data at 100 gigabits per second -- roughly 100 times faster than home Wi-Fi under the most optimistic circumstances. A next-generation version will quadruple that to 400Gbps, Intel said. Enlarge Image Intel's silicon photonics communciation modulePhoto by Intel Servers' data appetite has been growing explosively, said Kushagra Vaid, general manager of cloud hardware engineering for Microsoft's widely used Azure server infrastructure. Copper cables already struggle to hit 25Gbps with lengths just 10 feet long, he said, but silicon photonics could help the company scale to the next level. "When we get to 100 gigabits per second, we're going to hit a brick wall," Vaid said. "That's where silicon photonics is very interesting. It's a great way for us to continue that scaling." Fiber optics are widely used for long-haul communication links like undersea cables. Intel and other photonics fans expect integrating laser communications into chips will lower costs for the technology so it can be used for shorter distances within data centers and eventually inside a computer chassis. Intel's new module can send signals as far as 1.2 miles -- an immense improvement over copper cabling. Intel isn't alone in the market. IBM, Luxtera, Fujitsu and Silicon Valley startups are working on silicon photonics, too.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Advertisement Intel Corp. (IW 500/20), the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, said it’s licensing technology from rival ARM Holdings Plc, a move to win more customers for its business that manufactures chips for other companies. The two chipmakers, whose designs and technology dominate in computing and mobile, unveiled the agreement on August 16 at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. The accord will let Intel offer third-party semiconductor companies its most advanced 10-nanometer production lines for manufacturing the complex chips usually used in smartphones. Intel, which gets the majority of its revenue from making personal-computer processors, has failed to gain ground in the larger and faster-growing phone market -- the stronghold of ARM’s technology. Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, Intel is trying to persuade other chipmakers to use its factories for their production. Adding licenses for ARM’s technology could open up that business to fabricating chips based on those designs for companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Apple Inc., which now have their chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and others. Intel’s embrace of the competing technology comes as the PC market continues to decline and growth in the lucrative server-chip market slows. The Santa Clara, California-based company began offering foundry services -- outsourced manufacturing -- under Krzanich’s predecessor, Paul Otellini, but hadn’t announced any major customers placing orders in large volume. Popular Now What the 2016 Elections Mean for Manufacturers Trump Takes on Legal Immigration First with H-1B, Skilled Guest Worker Programs Economics to Keep Wind and Solar Energy Thriving With Trump Indicating that those fortunes may be changing, Intel announced that LG Electronics Inc., South Korea’s second-biggest phone maker behind Samsung Electronics Co., will use Intel’s foundry business to manufacture 10 nanometer mobile-phone parts. Separately, Intel said it won’t use extreme ultraviolet lithography as a manufacturing technique in its 10-nanometer production. The technology isn’t ready for the next generation of production, 7 nanometer, Intel also said, and the company won’t use the chipmaking technique until it delivers the promised efficiency. ASML Holding NV is the main manufacturer of EUV machinery and has been trying to make it ready for full use for more than a decade. ASML’s stock fell as much as 3.5 percent in U.S. trading Tuesday following the comments by Mark Bohr, Intel’s head of process architecture. “I can’t say whether it’s a year from now or three years from now,” Bohr said of the technique at the Intel conference. “I am hopeful.” By Ian King Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 Tom Cobett on Aug 18, 2016 I object to the use of the term "Foundry Services" to describe any business activity that is not based on the melting, pouring and shaping of metals. As a life-long participant in the foundry industry, and a current owner of a foundry, I can tell you that NOTHING else is like a foundry. We take cast off materials (scrap metals) from other industries, melt and refine them, and then pour them into high value, close tolerance, highly engineered components. Only a foundry does this kind of work. Only a business doing this kind if work should be referred to as a foundry. Foundry Services does not equate to Outsourced Manufacturing. Not all foundries do outsourced work for other companies. Outsourced Manufacturing implies that you could do the work in-house and in country, but, you have decided for whatever reason (probably profit) to have the work done by someone else (not in your country). Foundries exist because the metal casting process can only be done in a foundry. ALL METAL PRODUCTS start out by someone first melting and refining the raw ore or scrap metal and then pouring it into an engineered shape. Most companies who need to have metal castings buy them from foundries because that is the only place that they can be made. Is buying milk from a dairy farm outsourcing? Is buying tires from a rubber company outsourcing? Is buying automotive glass from a glass company outsourcing? We buy products from these specialty manufacturers because they have the knowledge and equipment to make things that we cannot make ourselves. If you think that making semiconductor products for another company is the same or even similar to a foundry, you have never been in a foundry and you don't have any idea what they really do. Go see a foundry and find out where the metals industry really starts. Log In or Register to post comments Please Log In or Register to post comments.

With Apple rumored to remove the jack with the iPhone 7 and devices like the Moto Z already having ditched the port altogether, consumers are justifiably concerned about a standards war they didn't ask for. As it stands, USB-C is only used in a select few phones and laptops like the aforementioned Moto phone and the newer Apple MacBook. Intel, however, thinks the versatile new USB-C standard won't just make for a viable headphone jack replacement, but a superior one as well. At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail explained how improvements to the USB-C standard, slated to arrive later this year, could make it a far better port for the modern-day smartphone, according to CNET. The most obvious advantage, at least to devices manufacturers, is slimmer phones. Without needing to route analog circuitry, a phone maker could switch to digital audio and shave off precious millimeters from the device's body. With digital audio, Saunders added, software and device makers could help cheaper earbuds take advantage of features reserved for more expensive headphones, like noise cancelling and bass boosting. Intel has been one of the biggest proponents of USB-C technology Beyond the need for cumbersome adapters, one of the biggest concerns with the loss of the headphone jack is power use. USB controllers are inherently more power-hungry than a 3.5mm port, and if there's anything that will push consumers to resist change, it's detrimental effects to battery life. Saunders says he and Ismail's revised specifications for USB-C could allow it to detect when users are not using the microphone on headphones and turn it off to save battery. "The difference in battery life is negligible" with USB headphones, Saunders suggested. There's also some video potential with USB-C, the duo explained. While not a viable HDMI replacement, USB-C is capable of high-throughput data transfers. That means you could hook a smartphone or computer up to a display through USB-C to run apps or watch movies. It may not be viable for gaming, but it's certainly a way to work around extra cable needs. Plus, USB-C can handle multiple connections at once, so you'd be able to use a USB hub to transmit video or mirror a display from a single port while at the same time charging the device and connecting a separate cable for peripherals. These changes collectively "will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio," Saunders concluded. This isn't Intel's first vocal push for USB-C. Back in April, the company detailed a proposal to remove the 3.5mm audio jack at its Shenzhen developer forum. The proposal laid out how the port is antiquated when considering the multi-purpose needs of modern phone users. It's not just video or audio improvements — USB-C opens up the possibility for all sorts of health tracking and other fitness-related functions that can be controlled from a single port. And last year at Computex, Intel became the most high-profile industry name to throw its weight behind USB-C, declaring that its Thunderbolt 3 interface would use the new standard instead of the existing Mini DisplayPort.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links Search Microsoft plans for all Windows 10 PCs support HoloLens in 2017 By Paul Lilly A major AR push. Shares At $3,000 for the Development Edition, Microsoft's HoloLens headset is expensive, even compared to the Oculus Rift ($599) and HTC Vive ($799). It's also not as far along as the Rift or Vive in terms of commercial availability and applications. Nevertheless, Microsoft sees a bright future for its AR headset and is committed to making sure all future Windows 10 PCs support mixed reality content. Microsoft's Windows boss Terry Myerson made that clear during Intel's annual developer's conference in which he announced a partnership with the Santa Clara chip maker. "All Windows 10 PCs next year will include a holographic shell," Myserson said, according to The Verge. He added that all PCs running Windows 10 will work with a head-mounted display and support all Windows holographic applications. The support Myerson is talking about will come by way of a Windows update, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications. Microsoft says it will enable an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, one that blends 2D and 3D apps at the same time while supporting a range of devices. When Microsoft talks of this working on mainstream PCs, it means that even those tiny Intel NUC machines will support the experience. Here's a video of Windows 10 Holographic shell running on a NUC at 90 frames per second. "Intel and Microsoft are collaborating on a specification for mixed reality ready PCs and HMDs. Our shared goal is to enable our hardware partners to build a broad range of devices for the mainstream consumer and business markets. We are working with several partners on the spec today, and plan to publicly release v1 of the spec at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) conference in Shenzhen in December," Microsoft said in a blog post. Microsoft's push to support HoloLens on all Windows 10 PCs seems focused on productivity at the moment, though it also paves the way for gaming, at least when the price of the headset comes way down. To that end, Microsoft earlier this month called to attention what Legendary was doing in the entertainment space with HoloLens and how it enables fans to get closer and interact with characters in new ways. It seems like a lot of hype the moment, but with Microsoft making a push to support HoloLens on mainstream PCs, things could start to fall into place rather quickly beginning next year.

 Intel's $25 million man says there are 3 massive changes happening in tech right now Eugene Kim Aug. 17, 2016, 1:56 PM 33,542 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel president Venkata "Murthy" RenduchintalaIntel Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, the high-profile exec Intel paid $25 million to poach from rival Qualcomm, shared the three biggest changes happening in tech during his keynote speech at Intel's annual Developer's Forum on Wednesday. Calling it "the greatest change in tech that’s going to happen to us in decades," Renduchintala laid out his vision for how the increase in connected devices and resulting volume of data, as well as new 5G connectivity, will reshape the tech space: 1) Computing will become more pervasive and ambient: Renduchintala believes computing, through PCs, smartphones, wearables, or even autonomous cars, will only become more pervasive in the coming years. Intel expects to see 50 billion connected devices and 200 billion connected sensors by 2020. These will create massive amounts of data.  2) Massive overhaul in the networks: Because of all the connected devices and resulting data that needs to be processed, the current network environment will need a massive overhaul, Renduchintala believes. That means faster processing and much more sophisticated data analysis capabilities across the board. That'll make the entire network faster, more secure, and more efficient. 3) 5G connectivity: Renduchintala believes the upcoming 5G connection will be the "lifeblood" binding everything together. He believes the shift to 5G will be as profound as the move from analog to digital, and will only make everything more intelligent, scalable, and secure. Renduchintala's vision is, of course, almost identical to where Intel's trying to take its business. Intel has been struggling to deal with the shrinking PC market, historically the largest revenue driver for the company. With its PC chip revenue declining, Intel has been putting more of its resources toward building connected devices, as well as network and data center chips, while touting the upcoming 5G connected world. Renduchintala's keynote was also notable because it was his first external public presentation since joining Intel last year. And it seems like people were impressed by his speech, as seen from industry analyst Patrick Moorhead's tweet: Murthy doing well on-stage. Fun, different to hear him talk about experiences driven by PCs and datacenter. #IDF16 pic.twitter.com/DcXeHbldpS — Patrick Moorhead (@PatrickMoorhead) August 17, 2016 SEE ALSO: After announcing plans to cut 12,000 people, here's what Intel's CEO says he wants to do next NOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception Loading video...

More like this Intel's megachips will take on Nvidia's GPUs and Google's TPUs Intel tunes its mega-chip for machine learning Lack of a high-quality GPU may hold Intel back on A.I. and VR Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel has pulled open the curtain on a secretly developed mega-chip called Knights Mill, a key component in its artificial-intelligence strategy. The chip, which belongs to the family of high-performance Xeon Phi processors, gives Intel a legitimate opportunity to tackle machine learning. It is targeted at servers and workstations and will be available in 2017. Intel was caught off-guard with the emergence of artificial intelligence as a way to analyze and present data. Knights Mill, introduced on Wednesday at the Intel Developer Forum, will fill a big hole in the company's chip lineup. Knights Mill is a "next generation" Xeon Phi chip, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, during a keynote at IDF. Based on what Intel has said so far, the chip will have stacked memory and fast throughput, but more detailed information won't be revealed for a while. It's a new kind of Xeon Phi chip, and it won't succeed the recent Knights Landing supercomputing chip. The goal with Knights Mill is to create a chip that can calculate quickly and make decisions based on probabilities and associations, said Jason Waxman, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Center Solutions Group, in an interview. The chips will have many cores and will make approximations using learning models and algorithms, Waxman said. The new chip is not to be confused with Intel's next-generation supercomputing chip called Knights Hill, which doesn't have a release date yet. The Knights Mill chip won't upset the release of Knights Hill, which was first outlined in late 2014 and will succeed the recent Knights Landing chip, which has up to 72 cores and was released earlier this year. With Knights Mill, Intel finally has a chip to take on the dominance of Nvidia's GPUs in machine learning, which allow software to be trained to do tasks like image recognition and  data analysis more efficiently. Google has also developed its own Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which is used alongside GPUs in machine learning. But there's a difference between Knights Mill and competitive chips. Knights Mill will be a primary chip, meaning it will be able to boot up computers. That will give it an advantage over Google's TPU and Nvidia's GPU, which are co-processors and still need CPUs to work in servers or workstations. The chip also gives a big boost to Intel's A.I. strategy, which is still coming together. Intel last week announced plans to acquire Nervana Systems, which offers deep-learning software and chip technology, for an estimated $350 million. The Nervana acquisition brings talent, intellectual property and also most importantly, software, which will be optimized to work with Knights Mill, Waxman said. High-performance chips typically focus on double-precision performance for more accurate calculations, but Knights Mill is designed differently. The chip's cores focus on "low precision calculations," which can be stringed together for approximations that can help the chip make a decision. The low-precision calculations help create powerful, and power-efficient, neural network clusters. The Knights Mill design also brings more floating point performance to calculations, which is important in machine learning, Waxman said. Intel is advancing its A.I. roadmap at a frantic pace, and Knights Mill is a leap forward, Waxman said. Many machine learning models are being used in data centers. Beyond its homegrown software stack, Intel could make Xeon Phi compatible with different machine-learning models like the open-source Caffe and Google's TensorFlow. Intel has shown a willingness to collaborate. Intel is working with Baidu on a "Deep Speech" speech recogntion technology with its Xeon Phi platform, Waxman said.

Diane Bryant holds up one of the gizmos 17 Aug 2016 at 17:51, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles Today the web was broken by countless hacked devices – your 60-second summary AMD is a rounding error on Intel's spreadsheet and that sucks for us all Intel stock falls on glum Q4 IDF16 Intel is beginning volume shipments of its fabled Silicon Photonics networking technology, which uses light through thin glass fibers to replace copper wires. This tech can shuttle up to 100Gbps over 2km or more of cable that's just a few millimeters thick, creating a high-speed nervous-system for clusters and data centers. As its name suggests, Silicon Photonics uses patterned silicon to emit and receive precisely aligned data-carrying laser signals. These devices can be fabricated just like normal CMOS chips, meaning they should be relatively cheap and easy to make at high volumes. The dream is to embed this technology into processors and chipsets so they can shift data directly from their internal buses to external networks. That's the ultimate goal. Right now, though, we're just being offered discrete transceivers. You can basically whack a load of Intel's PSM4 and CWDM4 Silicon Photonics modules into a switch, or similar, and use them to network with other Silicon Photonics-equipped boxes, effectively running 100G Ethernet between devices. This technology has been in development for about 16 years. Module ... What Intel's transceivers look like up close Today we learned that these modules have been shipping to selected customers since June. Microsoft, for one, has been playing with the technology in its Azure data centers, we're told. Diane Bryant, Intel's data center group boss, showed off one of these podules on stage at Chipzilla's developer forum in San Francisco. "Electrons running over network cables won’t cut it," she told the keynote audience this morning. "We are the first to light up silicon.” According to Intel veep Alexis Bjorlin: Intel Silicon Photonics is now in volume production and shipping in the form of 100G optical transceivers. The products, Intel Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 (Parallel Single Mode fiber 4-lane) and Intel Silicon Photonics 100G CWDM4 (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing 4-lane) are small form-factor, high speed, and low power consumption products, targeted for use in data communications applications, in particular for switch-to-switch optical interconnects in data centers. "Today, these products are already being deployed to connect switches to switches in large data centers," Bjorlin added. "In the future, as bandwidth to the server increases, the optical network will connect servers, displacing the copper interconnects that are increasingly limited in reach as bandwidth goes up." You can find some more info on the PSM4 here, and the CWDM4 here. From what we can tell, these are components for switch builders to create 100GbE devices – they don't come with PCIe interfaces or similar, in other words. As we mentioned earlier, this tech has been in development for years, and not just by Intel. Uni boffins and businesses, including IBM, have been working on silicon photonics. Meanwhile, of course, networking gear makers like Mellanox have 100Gbps Ethernet hardware that runs over 2km of cable, too. ® PS: We nicked the headline from our sister site The Next Platform, which has more background on Silicon Photonics here.

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY SAN FRANCISCO—At the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) here this week, Intel has done a lot to shed its processor-focused image, most notably with its Project Alloy "merged reality" initiative. But in case that's too earthbound for the company (and for you), Intel made another announcement that should really get things flying: Project Aero. Rather than a specific product, Aero is a platform on which developers can build any kind of drone they can conceive. The playing-card-size Aero device is based on a quad-core Atom processor, and offers the storage, communications, and I/O capabilities needed for any drone. An optional Vision Accessory Kit gives the device the ability to run applications as needed. The Aero compute board is currently available for purchase for $399 at click.intel.com. Those who are feeling less adventurous have another option. The Aero Ready To Fly Drone is a preassembled quadcopter based on Aero that also incorporates an Intel RealSense camera to give it what the company calls "depth and vision capabilities." Plug-and-play options make it easy to adapt the Ready To Fly drone to other usages, and include flight control, vision, and airspace service. According to Intel, the Ready To Fly Drone will be available by the end of the year. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY In a specially designed "Drone Cage" established on the second floor of the Moscone Center, Intel held multiple demonstrations throughout the day of the Ready To Fly Drone in action. Though limited space precluded the possibility of any fancy aerial tricks, the (obviously experienced) drone pilot showed how the Ready To Fly model was just as flexible and maneuverable as larger models. Considering this was the base platform model, it stands to reason that creative and enterprising developers will be able to spin off Aero into even more visually and technologically exciting directions in the months to come.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Gadgets Intel’s Project Alloy is a wireless VR headset for merged reality experiences Gadgets Intel’s Project Alloy is a wireless VR headset for merged reality experiences By Bindu Nair - Intel has officially entered the world of virtual reality with its very own VR headset called Project Alloy. The Head-Mounted Device (HMD) promises merged reality experiences which blur the line between the real and the virtual. Project Alloy is set apart from the likes of the Oculus Rift by virtue of being completely untethered. All its computing power is derived from inside the headset itself, which means people won’t have to deal with or be limited by wires. There aren’t even any controllers to go with it since their hands can be used to interact with elements of the virtual environment thanks to Intel’s RealSense technology. Such a merged reality scenario is possible because of the in-built Intel RealSense 3D cameras, getting rid of the need to set up external sensors or lenses around a room. The company has even put up an intriguing demonstration of the device’s AR and VR potential in a video. In it, a person walks into a party where people interact with them in a realistic manner. They can walk in any direction, use their hands to pick up a drink, and even pause the proceedings to move people around. It’s an interesting concept and could take the current crop of VR games to the next level. Also Read: Intel’s new 10-core CPU costs more than $1700 Intel has also announced its collaboration with Microsoft to out a set of specifications for mixed reality PCs and head-mounted displays. The latter is currently working on its Windows Holographic Shell for developers to run and make mixed reality applications. The platform is set to arrive for all Windows 10 PCs next year. It’ll allow all VR and AR headsets, including Microsoft’s own HoloLens, to run 2D and 3D apps. Meanwhile, Intel is planning to release the Project Alloy hardware and open APIs to developers and partners in 2017.

Dubbed a "merged reality" device, Intel's Project Alloy sounds like something straight out of a science-fiction novel, allowing the wearer to see their hands and other objects in virtual worlds and environments. Project Alloy works by using Intel’s RealSense depth-sensing cameras - the same ones used in Windows 10 laptops and computers for facial-recognition systems. These cameras can accurately capture and map a user's hands, and place them into the virtual space. Merging this with a virtual world on the headset's screen, wearers can use their hands to physically interact with their environment. During Project Alloy's unveiling at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich claimed the device would, "redefine what is possible with computing". From footage shown on stage, it's clear that Intel's RealSense camera can pick up low-resolution scans of real-life objects to import into a virtual space. It's also evident that objects are only detected when held close to a user's face. Still, as a Medium post by Krzanich points out , the technology does have advantages over the likes of Oculus Rift or HTC Vive , which require users to install and setup sensors to capture a room for positional tracking. Here, Intel’s headset does the heavy lifting itself, using depth-sensing cameras to work out your position within a given space. Project Alloy is like Microsoft's HoloLens , in that it's a completely wireless system. This has its advantages, such as never becoming tangled in a wire or being "jolted" out of an experience due to the limitations of a cord. However, by processing everything onboard, it's unlikely that Intel's Project Alloy will be able to replicate the silky smooth experience of a proper VR headset running on a high-end PC. If anything, it will be more akin to Samsung’s Gear VR headset. It's also hard to imagine exactly what something like Project Alloy would feel like, without controllers. Krzanich describes a scenario where you "pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually onto the court at Wimbledon… fully lean into practicing your back swing – bringing both your hand and racket into the virtual field of play.” While that approach to play may work for Krzanich and his tennis-court-sized living room, most of us would be a little nervous about swinging a full-sized tennis racket around our houses. Intel isn't looking to actually manufacture Project Alloy itself. Instead, it wants to ensure it doesn't miss out on a vital new market like it did with the rise of the smartphone. Intel plans to sell its Alloy technology to manufacturing partners who can use it to develop their own "mixed reality" products. Currently, nobody has been named as working with Intel on the headset, but Microsoft has stated that Windows 10 will soon support Alloy via an update.

During the session Jon ‘Elmor’ Sandstrom was able to break the World Record for the highest CPU clock frequency on the Intel Core i7-6950X processor. Elmor was able to overclock the Intel Core i7-6950X processor up to 5731.78MHz on one of the 10 processor cores. Elmor used the recently released ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 motherboard and a good amount of Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) to reach this epic overclock that is validated. This is almost double the base clock frequency of this specific processor and shows just how far you can push an Intel Core i7-6950X processor if you have the right hardware. Hitting frequencies this high on a Core i7-6950X are the usually the result of cherry picking processors though, so don’t expect to be able to repeat this at home with a single off the shelf processor. Prior to this the overclocking record was 5726.84MHz and was turned in by slamms on an ASUS Rampage V Edition 10 motherboard as well. YOUDIEMOFO Siiiiiiiiiiiiick…..!

The company also suggests that Apple is making the wrong move using Lightning for audio. Via CNET, Intel has announced it will be adding digital audio to the USB-C spec later this year. At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail sketched out a coming USB audio standard that could help push the 3.5mm jack aside. The new specification, due this quarter, adds features to ensure a USB headphone doesn’t drain too much battery power and defines how buttons for pausing music or lowering volume work. The work “will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio,” Saunders said. The company is also adding a new video standard to USB-C, to incorporate HDMI. However, this video standard will not provide the frame rate required to play games. More notably, Intel will be adding device authentication to improve security in the latest USB-C spec. While jumping on the USB-C bandwagon on the iPhone could resolve some issues, it’s unlikely that Apple will move away from Lightning. The iPhone maker has already gotten a ton of flack (and still does to this day), for moving from the 30-pin dock connector to Lightning.

The decision could strike a major blow to semiconductor company Qualcomm, to which LG is a major customer. Korean phone manufacturer LG will use Intel's 10-nanometer process to develop a new generation of mobile processors, based on ARM's 64-bit technology. These will be built in Intel factories and used within LG's own electronics and mobile devices. It's unclear whether LG's home-grown chips will be limited to certain product ranges or used across all devices. Either way, it's sure to have a knock-on effect for Qualcomm, who has traditionally provided the processors for LG's smartphones. LG has been attempting to cut its dependency on the chipmaker for some time. Earlier this year, the companies became embroiled in a lawsuit over licensing fees for Qualcomm's chipsets. LG is not the first customer Qualcomm has seen depart either: Samsung famously snubbed Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 for the Galaxy S6 back in 2015, and since then its growing self-reliance has been damaging to Qualcomm. Apple and Huawei, who rank highly in Eastern and Western respectively, also have their own chip designs. Meanwhile, low-cost players like MediaTek and Marvell are gaining market share as they offer a cheaper alternative to Qualcomm'. It's unclear when the first LG-powered devices will hit the market, although it's unlikely to be for some time given that actual production has yet to begin. LG's forthcoming V20 flagship, for example, is widely expected to come packing Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chipset.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 2 min read Layoffs Cisco Systems to Lay Off About 14,000 Employees Reuters From Reuters Overtime Judge Blocks Obama Rule Extending Overtime Pay to 4.2 Million Workers Make More Happen Retailers Push Deals Early as Black Friday Loses Focus Facebook Facebook Builds Censorship Tool to Get Back Into China August 17, 2016 This story originally appeared on Reuters Cisco Systems Inc. is laying off about 14,000 employees, representing nearly 20 percent of the network equipment maker's global workforce, technology news site CRN reported, citing sources close to the company. San Jose, California-based Cisco is expected to announce the cuts within the next few weeks, the report said, as the company transition from its hardware roots into a software-centric organization.  Apart from Cisco, the other tech giants, which have announced job cuts in the face of PC industry decline in recent years, are Microsoft Corp., HP Inc. and Intel Corp. Microsoft Corp. kicked off one of the largest layoffs in Tech history in July 2014 after it said it would slash 18,000 jobs.  HP Inc. said in September 2015 that it expected to cut about 33,300 jobs over three years. Intel said in April that it would slash up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce. Cisco, which had more than 70,000 employees as of April 30, declined to comment. Cisco increasingly requires "different skill sets" for the "software-defined future" than it did in the past, as it pushes to capture a higher share of the addressable market and aims to boost its margins, the CRN report said citing a source familiar with the situation. Cisco has been investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers, to offset the impact of sluggish spending by telecom carriers and enterprises on its main business of making network switches and routers. The company has already offered many early retirement package plans to Cisco's employees, according to CRN. Up until Tuesday's close of $31.12 on the Nasdaq, the company's stock had risen about 15 percent this year, compared with a 10.5 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Hardware & Equipment index.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  Exclusive: Gigabyte Brix Gaming UHD Inside Pics and CPU Temps Exclusive: Gigabyte Brix Gaming UHD Inside Pics and CPU Temps Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Wed, Aug 17, 2016 - 10:13 AM Earlier this year, Gigabyte unveiled the Brix Gaming UHD and it looked to be the most powerful Brix mini-PC ever designed to target the gamer market. The Brix Gaming UHD is still on track to be released by the “the end of the year” and at IDF 2016 we were able to witness Gigabyte remove the enclosure on this Intel NUC alternative for the first time. The Brix Gaming UHD measures in at 220 x 110 x 110 mm and comes in a sleek looking back and silver tower. Gigabyte hopes this design solves the noisy fan complaints that plagued the original Brix Gaming systems as this entire design was drawn up to improve air flow thanks to being able to use a larger fan. Gigabyte was able to take off the cover for us on their demo system to show us for the very first time what the inside looks like! As you can see the CPU and GPU are on different PCBs that are connected with two cables and each has a large heatsink covering the chip to help keep them cool. The DDR4 memory slots and M.2 storage slot is located in the middle of the housing, so it looks like this will be a bit tricky to work on and is likely why most will be sold pre-built. The Gigabyte Brix Gaming UHD on display at IDF 2016 was the Gigabyte GB-BNi7HG4-950 BRIX. Inside this model is an Intel Core i7-6700HQ quad-core processor with Hyper-Threading (2.6GHz base/3.5GHz boost), an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 GPU, 32GB (2x16GB) HyperX Impact DDR4 SO-DIMM memory running 3000 MHz and a HyperX Predator 960GB PCIe M.2 SSD. You also have an Intel Wireless-AC 8260 card for dual-band 2×2 Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2. Not bad hardware for a device that obviously has some size constraints when it comes to what you can shoehorn inside it. It should be noted that Kingston was using a barebone version and installed their own hardware inside to showcase it. We aren’t sure what the barebone version will be priced at, but we have been told that a fully configured model with Windows 10 already installed will be around $1300. A wild guess might put a barebone model at $899 to $999 as it wouldn’t come with an M.2 PCIe SSD, DDR4 memory kit or a Windows 10 license.   Since the Gigabyte Brix Gaming UHD was running in the Kingston booth it gave us the opportunity to look at the CPU temperatures. Kingston was running MemTestPro to show the 32GB HyperX Impact DDR4 3000MHz memory kit was stable, but it also put the CPU at 100% load. We took a quick peak into AIDA64 and saw the CPU sitting at 92C. Not exactly a cool running machine, but AIDA64 showed that it wasn’t thermal throttling and the system was running all the tests at 3.1GHz, which is well over the CPUs base clock speed. We can’t comment about noise as we were on the floor of a trade show with hundreds of people walking around. We hope that Gigabyte can launch the BRIX Gaming UHD here soon we’ve been talking about it for months. The discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 graphics card is nice, but the GeForce 10-series is rolling out and there doesn’t appear to be an upgrade path for the graphics on this ~$1300 system. It will be interesting to see if Gigabyte rolls this PC out later this year with GTX 950 graphics or if they’ll update to GTX 1050/1060 graphics. The GeForce GTX 950 reference design has a 95W TDP rating and a GeForce GTX 1060 3GB/6GB is 120W, so we don’t think that is going to be likely for this form factor if we are hitting 92C on the CPU with basically no load on the GPU.   Matthew Elvidge A low rpm, replaceable and controllable fan to shift air through the entire ‘brick’ would probably be very welcome to the design. Not only would it make it last longer, but itd run smoother and with less throttling. Could make it a very viable LAN pc. Mohit Dua Thanks for sharing this quality information with us.

(Seeking Alpha) Following better-than-seasonal notebook ODM shipments in Q2:16, July notebook shipments declined 21 percent month-on-month, below normal seasonality. Citi’s Christopher Danely reiterated a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), with a price target of $35. July Shipments “We continue to believe the recent PC strength was due to re-stocking, and expect notebook shipments to be seasonal during 3Q16 before falling below seasonality in 4Q16,” Danely mentioned. July shipments fell 21 percent month-on-month, as compared to the normal seasonality of a 16 percent month-on-month decline. However, this decline was in line with the estimate. Related Link: Proofpoint Has Upside On High-Profile Cyber Attacks Notebook units are expected to increase 5–8 percent quarter-on-quarter in 3Q16, in line with the normal seasonality of a 6 percent quarter-on-quarter rise. “Last year, notebook shipments were above expectations in 3Q15 due to re-stocking, in line with expectations in 4Q15, and below expectations in 1Q16. This year, notebook shipments were above expectations in 2Q16, and we expect notebook shipments to be in line with expectations in 3Q16 before falling off in 4Q16,” Danely stated. Risk To Consensus The analyst believes the PC space drives Intel’s shares, given that half the company’s EPS is derived from the PC end market. However, with a recovery in Intel’s server business already accounted for in the consensus forecasts and guidance, Danely believes the risk to the consensus expectations was increasing.

An anonymous reader writes: Nvidia has called out Intel for juicing its chip performance in specific benchmarks -- accusing Intel of publishing some incorrect "facts" about the performance of its long-overdue Knights Landing Xeon Phi cards. Nvidia's primary beef is with the following Intel slide, which was presented at a high performance computing conference (ISC 2016). Nvidia disputes Intel's claims that Xeon Phi provides "2.3x faster training" for neural networks and that it has "38 percent better scaling" across nodes. It looks like Intel opted for the classic using-an-old-version-of-some-benchmarking-software manoeuvre. Intel claimed that a Xeon Phi system is 2.3 times faster at training a neural network than a comparable Maxwell GPU system; Nvidia says that if Intel used an up-to-date version of the benchmark (Caffe AlexNet), the Maxwell system is actually 30 percent faster. And of course, Maxwell is Nvidia's last-gen part; the company says a comparable Pascal-based system would be 90 percent faster. On the 38-percent-better-scaling point, Nvidia says that Intel compared 32 of its new Xeon Phi servers against four-year-old Nvidia Kepler K20 servers being used in ORNL's Titan supercomputer. Nvidia states that modern GPUs, paired with a newer interconnect, scale "almost linearly up to 128 GPUs." fraud gpu intel ← Related Links → NSA Worried About Implications of Leaked Toolkits Apple iPhone 7 Plus Packs 3GB RAM, Early A10 Fusion Benchmarks Look Very Strong Intel To Manufacture Rival ARM Chips In Mobile Push This discussion has been archived.

Real-world loads don't tend to follow benchmarks religiously, and the newer benchmark might favor a configuration that's not as good in real-world loads. The classical marketing maneuver is to select from multiple sets of up-to-date benchmarks and pick the ones that favor your particular product. CPUBoss usually shows that one CPU outperforms another consistently (except for single-core vs threaded with dissimilar cores or SMT--fast clock wins single-core, many-cores wins threaded); and frequently shows the same benchmark tool using different strategies and rating each CPU faster than the other based on how it was configured, or shows that one benchmark favors one CPU and another favors the other. This goes all the way up to real-world functional tests, where you select games which perform better because of some feature or strategy of your GPU and CPU. You have better shaders? Pick a shader-heavy game. Heavy parallelism? Pick a game that meshes with that. You've got fewer parallel operations, but a higher clock? Avoid games that work best with 387-core GPUs and pick ones that like that 1185MHz clock. Show off 6 or 7 games running at freakishly-high 292fps.

The new gadget is dubbed to be a rival for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Project Alloy uses Intel's RealSense technology, which includes cameras that measure relative depth, position, and orientation. Тhey're located on the headset and allow for "room-to-room" tracking, letting you move around your environment. Intel revealed it is in continuous collaboration with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content on the Alloy and other Intel-based VR gadgets. The Alloy will serve as a platform to third-party companies to make their own all-in-one VR headsets. Intel pledged to open the VR headset's hardware, APIs and other necessary tools to developers and partners in 2017.

SAN FRANCISCO—Intel and ARM have been the major players in what has become the central competition in the processor market. Intel has failed to make much headway into a mobile chip space dominated by ARM and its partners, while ARM has been looking to make traction in data centers, where Intel silicon powers more than 95 percent of servers. Now, these two rivals are coming together in a partnership that promises to benefit both companies. At the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) here Aug. 16, officials from both vendors announced that Intel's chip foundry business will build chips for mobile and consumer devices based on ARM's architecture. The agreement will boost Intel's custom manufacturing business, which has been building for the past few years, by adding IP from the company whose architecture powers almost all of the smartphones and tablets in the world. For ARM and its partners—including Qualcomm, Samsung and Apple—the deal gives them access to Intel's powerful chip-manufacturing capabilities and cutting-edge technologies, as well as a foundry option beyond Globalfoundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacture Corp. (TSMC) and Samsung. "Bringing these [vendors] together makes sense," Will Abbey, general manager of ARM's Physical IP Group, said during a technical session at IDF. Both Abbey and Zane Ball, vice president and general manager of Intel's Custom Foundry business, noted that Intel and ARM had at times worked together in the past—for example, Ball pointed out that field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) by its Altera subsidiary are built on ARM's architecture. In a post on the ARM blog, Abbey wrote that "Intel and ARM have worked together for years to help enable the ecosystem, and this is just the latest milestone in that long-standing relationship." However, this is a significant step for both companies. Intel launched its foundry system several years ago, giving third parties access to its substantial chip-manufacturing technologies. Ball said the company has grown its foundry capabilities from its 22nm and 14nm FinFET processes, and is now doing the same at 10nm. The business "is helping customers around the world by providing access to Intel's technology and manufacturing assets through turnkey services including design, wafer manufacturing, packaging and testing," he wrote on the company blog. "We're enabling new products and experiences on Intel's leading-edge technologies with industry standard design kits, silicon-proven IP blocks, and design services spanning from low-power SOCs [systems-on-a-chip] to high-performance infrastructure devices." ARM will be able to leverage that 10nm design platform for its Artisan physical IP, which includes memory compilers, high-performance and high-density libraries and point of presence (POP) IP for future mobile chips, Ball said. IP development is underway and ARM chips manufactured by Intel are expected to be available in early 2017. Intel famously missed out on the rise of smartphones and tablets, and failed in its efforts over several years to catch up. Under CEO Brian Krzanich, the company in April announced it was canceling development of several low-power chips that had been aimed at mobile devices, opting instead to focus those resources on such emerging growth areas as the cloud, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics and the internet of things (IoT). Intel has been working with Qualcomm, Applied Micro, Cavium and other chip makers to drive its low-power architecture into the data center to compete with Intel in such areas as hyperscale environments and cloud service providers. In addition to the ARM announcement, Intel's Ball said LG Electronics also will build chips using the foundry business' 10nm process, while Spectrum, a major mobile chip maker in China, is using Intel's 14nm foundry platform. Achronix Semiconductor and Netronome are using Intel's 22nm process for their respective networking chips, and Altera is using the foundry platform to build what Ball called "the first true 14nm FPGA."           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple Starts Program to Repair iPhones With 'Touch Disease' for $149 Google Touts Encryption Support On New Pixel Android Phones MobileIron Adds Single Sign-On to Box, Office 365, Salesforce Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Intel was an ARM license holder back in the early days of the personal digital assistant (PDA), and found its StrongARM and XScale chips in devices like the HP Compaq iPaq 5450 and other products of that ilk. But Intel jettisoned its ARM division in 2006 to focus on x86 processors, only to see a huge surge in ARM processor deployments with the rise of smartphones a few short years later. Intel tried to counter with its own low-powered, x86-based smartphones SoCs, but its efforts proved futile. Now, Intel is deciding to wade back in to the ARM waters as an ARM licensee. The chip giant will not design and market its own ARM-based designs, but it will offer its mammoth custom foundry business to produce ARM processors for other companies. This move will put Intel in contention to steal away contracts from ARM industry stalwarts like Samsung, Global Foundries and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). Intel Custom Foundry will even make its upcoming 10 nanometer process technology available to customers looking to produce ARM processors using ARM’s Artisan Physical IP. “Our 10 nm technology will provide improvements in transistor scaling and offer new performance, power and cost benefits as well as a wide range of device features to meet different product requirements,” writes Zane Ball, Intel Technology and Manufacturing Group VP and co-GM of the Intel Custom Foundry. “Having leading IP providers in our portfolio will accelerate ecosystem readiness while providing greater flexibility and time-to-market advantages to our customers.” Speaking of customers, Intel has already lined up LG Electronics, Spreadstrum, Achronix Semiconductor, Netronome and Altera. Of those customers, LG will be the first to tap into Intel’s 10nm goldmine.

The all-in-one solution allows a user to experience VR without cords connecting to the computer, and also provides an immersive experience through “merged reality.” In addition, Intel announced it is collaborating with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy. Intel will open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem — allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products from the Alloy design — in 2017. The collaboration is going to allow the industry to get to scale, Kim Pallister, director of the Virtual Reality Center of Excellence at Intel, tells Forbes. “That’s a necessary component for the whole ecosystem to become profitable and take off,” Pallister notes in that interview. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled the project, which leverages Intel RealSense cameras attached to the headset, so it’s not dependent on setting up any external sensors or cameras around the room. VR fans who find cords hanging from a VR headset annoying will like that the computing power is located in the Alloy head-mounted device (HMD), allowing the user to experience VR untethered. That gives a free range of motion with 6 degrees of freedom across a large space, Intel points out in a statement. Along with collision detection and avoidance, users can utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space. Intel also highlighted in its statement the merged reality experience, “where you can see your hands, see your friends … see the wall you are about to run into.” With Intel RealSense technology, users can see these elements from the real world as well as use their hands to interact with elements of the virtual world, merging realities. In related news, The Los Angeles Times is reporting that Intel plans to open a studio in L.A., dubbed Intel Tech Experience Labs, which will focus on helping third parties develop VR content using Intel technology. Particulars about that are limited, but the newspaper quotes Krzanich as saying it will be “dedicated to pushing the limits of the technology for production, to really define what is possible with the tech.” Intel’s Craig Raymond displays the Project Alloy virtual reality headset during the Day 1 keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016.

There were other announcements from the show that highlighted the company's vision for the future of the industry. Here is the roundup of Day 1 of the Intel's event being held in San Francisco. At the event, Intel announced Project Euclid, based on company's RealSense "perceptual computing". In its current form, it is a dongle that "brings sensors to any robot," as explained by company's Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich at the event. The stick runs Linux and packs an Atom processor. It further has a RealSense camera, inbuilt motion sensors, and a detachable battery.Intel has reportedly said that Project Euclid will be made available in first half of 2017 and will be carrying the current generation of RealSense camera. Another module powered by Intel's RealSense technology that was launched by the company at Day 1 of IDF 2016 was Joule. Meant to help power machine vision, Joule is being termed as a powerful developer kit that's essentially a tiny computer for devices that use cameras for vision, like robots or drones. Two kits were unveiled, the Joule 550x and the Joule 570x, with the top-end variant costing $369 (via The Verge). The Intel Joule machine vision developer kits - which run a Linux OS - are available to purchase online and the company has said that it plans to make it available in around 100 countries by the end of this year. In another exciting announcement made on Wednesday, Krzanich announced that Intel will make a studio in Hollywood in order to produce 360-degree virtual reality content related mostly to sports and entertainment. The studio will be used to build upon the company's 360 Replay technology that was earlier used in the NBA Finals. At the event, Intel also announced that ditching headphone jack, a move which Apple is widely expected to make, might be the right choice after all. Rahman Ismail and Brad Saunders from Intel supported the argument by saying that such a move will enable the move from analogue to digital and will therefore present more advantages than problems. As we mentioned, Intel at the its developer event launched its first mixed reality headset - Project Alloy. The Project Alloy headset does not need to be tethered to a PC and allows user with the freedom to move around. Microsoft had also announced its partnership with Intel and explained how the company is working on a set of specifications so that Windows 10 PCs can be used with headsets such as company's own HoloLens. Perhaps the biggest announcement that Intel made at Day 1 of IDF was its licensing agreement with rival chip designer ARM Holdings to produce 10nm ARM-based chips. LG will be the first major manufacturer to use chips from Intel's new service.

Intel shows off cordless virtual reality set USA TODAY 8/17/2016 Allana Akhtar and Alexandra Mosher © Bloomberg Brian Krzanich, chief executive officer of Intel Corp., displays a Project Alloy virtual reality (VR) headset during a keynote speech at the 2016 Intel Developers Forum (IDF) in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016. Intel staked a solid claim in virtual reality Tuesday at its developer forum, introducing the prototype for an untethered, all-in-one virtual reality headset it calls Project Alloy. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.13 -0.67 -0.60% Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 68.24 -7.75 -10.19% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.32 -7.01 -0.89% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.34 -0.79 -1.28% In his keynote, CEO Brian Krzanich made clear Intel wants its chips and technology to play a major role in this emerging market. "Virtual reality represents one of those fundamental shifts that redefine the way we work, how we are going to entertain and how we communicate," he said. Krzanich demonstrated a battery-powered, untethered virtual reality headset system that includes all the computational and graphic power it needs onboard. That in turn will set users free to move through virtual reality constructs without running into the physical constraints of a cord. It also would allow the wearer to interact with the world in what’s being called augmented reality, technology that shows users an image overlay of their surroundings, giving them information about what they’re looking at or allowing them to manipulate virtual objects. The Project Alloy headset incorporated Intel’s front-facing 3-D camera technology, which it calls Real Sense. That gives users the ability to use hand gestures to execute commands. The headset Krzanich showed the audience was a single unit, no trailing wires, no tethering to a computer. The design contrasts with Facebook's Oculus Rift, the $600 VR headset that has been dinged by some reviewers because it tethers users to a box and limits movement.  “It’s completely self-contained virtual world all in one package. To me, that’s what virtual reality means,” Krzanich said. It doesn’t appear that Intel actually plans to build VR headsets but rather to provide the design for various developers to work with. By the second half of 2017 the company plans to make the specifications for Alloy available to all, “allowing everyone access to the build sheets, exactly what it takes to build an Alloy themselves,” Krzanich said. That’s not surprising as Intel has never been a consumer product company, but instead enabling consumer products such as PC, said Brian Blau, a senior Intel analyst with Gartner. “I suspect Project Alloy is similar to Google Daydream. It’s potentially a device, it's being prototyped, but it’s more of a set of specification that partners can use to build devices,” he said. He noted that historically, Intel has worked hard to associate the Intel brand with new technologies, the long-running “Intel Inside” campaign for PCs branded that into consumers brains.  Now the Mountain View, Calif. company’s task is to associate the Intel brand with this new, all-in-one form for virtual reality, Blau said. Intel did not announce how much the Project Alloy headset might sell for. The bigger news long term may be that Intel and Microsoft plan on working together on virtual and augmented reality, said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. Both companies were late to the game when it came to smartphones and it appears they don’t plan to miss this virtual train. “Microsoft and Intel working together on mixed reality is a very positive sign and historically, more has been accomplished with the two working together than against each other,” said Moorhead. Microsoft executive vice president Terry Myerson joined Intel's Krzanich on stage to say the two companies were working together on software to run virtual reality devices. Microsoft is developing its own VR headset, the HoloLens, which contains Intel chips. Additionally, Microsoft has said that all Windows 10 systems will have some capability of augmented reality capability. Together, that adds up to a lot of ways for consumers to access this emerging technology, Moorhead said. No cords The untethered headset Krzanich showed the audience represents what could be the breakthrough form factor that will take VR from a niche device for game players to something that is truly becomes part of daily life in the way smartphones have. How users enter virtual and augmented reality spaces today tends to fall into three groups. There are tethered headsets that plug into a computer, smartphone-based headsets that snap a phone into a headset and all-in-one headsets that contain all the processing and battery power. “It’s a really interesting device because they have everything in one package, you don't have to worry about having the right smartphone or which headset you have, you don’t have to buy an expensive headset,” Blau said.

By Conner Forrest | August 17, 2016, 6:34 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus The Intel Custom Foundry. Image: Intel As a result of a new partnership between ARM and Intel Custom Foundry, Intel will begin producing chips based on ARM's physical intellectual property. The collaboration could boost Intel's prowess in the Internet of Things (IoT) space, and potentially gain them a larger audience with mobile OEMs. The announcement was made Tuesday at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum, hosted in San Francisco. For those who may seem surprised at the partnership, a blog post by ARM's Will Abbey said that it is nothing new. "Despite press stories, Intel and ARM have worked together for years to help enable the ecosystem, and this is just the latest milestone in that long-standing relationship," Abbey wrote. In the post, Abbey noted three specific benefits to the SoC (system on a chip) partnership: "The benefits to our partners by expanding the ARM ecosystem to offer more manufacturing choices for premium mobile and consumer SoCs." "Intel Custom Foundry will give its customers access to world-class physical IP and ARM implementation solutions." "All the major foundries now offer Artisan platforms, further confirming it as the industry standard for physical IP." SEE: Mobile device computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) Partnering with ARM is merely the latest step on Intel's road to restructure more strongly around IoT and the data center. ARM, which stands for Advanced RISC Machines, is Britain's largest technology firm and its chips are in most smartphones in the market today. However, ARM was recently acquired by Softbank for £24.3 billion specifically for its IoT expertise. By partnering with ARM, Intel could strongly improve its offerings in IoT, and broaden its customer base.

In addition to strengthening its offerings in IoT, the ARM partnership could get Intel closer to a very important ARM customer—Apple. As noted by ZDNet's Larry Dignan, Apple "could use Intel to diversify its supply chain." In fact, some reports even predict that the upcoming iPhone model will use Intel chips. Either way, the ARM partnership is good news for Intel's foundry business, as it gives their customers more options in terms of increasing options in chip design. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers ARM and Intel Custom Foundry are partnering to build SoCs (system on a chip) using the 10nm process. The partnership will see Intel utilizing the ARM Artisan platform, which could improve the company's offerings in the connected devices and IoT space. This collaboration could also mean Intel getting closer to producing key chips for Apple's iPhone, as Apple is a long-time ARM customer. Click here to subscribe to our Mobile Enterprise newsletter.

X Intel’s chips deal with ARM helps it into the mobile market As the PC market declines in favour of tablets and smartphones, Intel needs help switching Wed, Aug 17, 2016, 11:30 Updated: Wed, Aug 17, 2016, 15:12 Ciara O'Brien Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (left) and technical marketing engineer Craig Raymond demonstrate its Project Alloy virtual reality headset: the company is a major employer in Ireland so we have an interest in its success. Photograph: Intel Corporation/EPA         The news that Intel had signed a deal with ARM to produce its rivals chips may be seen by some as an admission of defeat of sorts. At one point, Intel was trying to crack that market with its own line of mobile focused chips, hoping to replicate its success in the PC market in the new generation of mobile devices. It needed to make the change. Intel still gets much of its revenue from the ever declining PC market, which hit a peak five years ago and has been on a steady fall ever since. Hastening its demise is the new generation of internet connected devices: tablets and smartphones. The impact has been huge: by the end of 2016, experts believe the PC market will have 100 million units less than the 2011 high. It should have been an easy transition for Intel. The company was once the undisputed king of the chip makers. If you had a PC, chances are there was an Intel chip running it. Consumers knew and trusted the name. Many could repeat the little chime that ran at the end of PC television ads along with the “Intel Inside” log. Times have changed. The shift from PCs and laptops to tablets and mobiles has left the company appearing to flounder, unable to find a solid enough footing in the market. Intel has, by and large, missed the mobile boat. And yet it has 10 nanometer production lines that could be put to good use in making chips. Intel strikes technology licensing deal with ARM Intel to buy startup Nervana System to add cloud service Strong microchip sales help Intel post 2.6% rise in revenue With its PC business diminishing, something needed to give. Licensing technology from third-party rivals will give Intel a way into the mobile industry. Mobile market domination ARM on the other hand has dominated the mobile industry. Its chip design is used by Apple, Samsung, Nvidia and Qualcomm among others. ARM-based chips are in iPads, iPhones, most Android phones, even Kindles. Largely flying under the radar with consumers, the Cambridge-based company has got itself into a nice position, and it was one that even the might of Intel couldn’t conquer. ADVERTISEMENT So the deal with ARM makes sense for Intel. It could lead to more business with Qualcomm and Apple, putting Intel at the heart of the mobile industry, a position it has tried – and failed – to reach under its own steam. Intel is still a major player in the chip space. The company makes 80 per cent of the chips that run the world’s servers, but rivals have designs on its territory. AMD, once considered a major rival for Intel in the server industry recently announced plans to downgrade its ARM chips and return to x86 chips. As a major employer in Ireland, we have a vested interest in Intel’s success. The company employs around 5,000 people in its plant in Leixlip, and has invested more than $12.5 billion (€11bn) in the facility over more than 25 years. But not everything has been positive. Earlier this year the company announced it was cutting 11 per cent of its global workforce – 12,000 jobs – and some of that would be in Ireland. Indirectly, the company also suffered a defeat when a case brought to the Supreme Court by farmer Thomas Reid against a compulsory purchase order by the IDA for his family’s land, beside the Leixlip campus, was decided in favour of the farmer. There is a bit of optimism though. Under chief executive Brian Krzanich, the company has been pushing into new markets. Keen to take advantage of the growing trend for the Internet of Things and to avoid a repeat of the mobile strategy fiasco, Intel has shown off chips that are the size of a button and could cost as little as $10. The Irish operation has played a part in the design of these systems through its work on the Quark chip and the Gallileo board. Strongholds The cheaper chips won’t be as lucrative as the company’s former product strongholds. The Internet of Things only accounts for 4 per cent of the company’s sales, and with the cost per chip much lower than the PC or server business, it will take a lot of Internet of Things adoption for Intel to reach its previous heights. That’s not all Intel is getting involved in. At the Intel developer forum, the company showed off a virtual reality headset that removes the wired connection to a computer and allows objects from the real world to be integrated in the digital. It uses an array of cameras and sensors that also allow the user to move throughout multiple rooms and interact with objects. “Project Alloy takes the cord off the VR headset,” said Mr Krzanich. “To me that’s what virtual reality means.” The design is set to be open-source material, so developers can put their own spin on it. Intel is making the right noises at least. The Internet of Things is expected to grow to more than 30 billion devices by 2020, about treble its size in 2015. Getting in there early will – hopefully – stop the mistakes of Intel’s mobile era repeating themselves.       Topics: Brian Kzranich Thomas Reid AMD Apple Intel Nvidia Qualcomm Samsung Leixlip Read More Intel considering sale of cybersecurity unit Final wave of Intel staff in Ireland leaves in restructuring Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

It wasnt long ago that the advent of computers in cars prompted jokes about cars being hacked or enduring a blue screen of death, but hackers tinkering with our trucks is now a reality, and it means every link in the automotive supply chain needs to think about their role in security. The tipping point was when connectivity was added to vehicles, Steve Grobman, president of Intels Automotive Security Review Board (SRB), told EBN in a recent telephone interview. If you an have embedded system that has a vulnerability, but it is air gapped and isolated, it doesn't pose a risk. But when these systems become connected, a latent vulnerability becomes exploitable, he said. Its just not network connectivity that makes automobiles less secure, but the ability to plug other devices into a vehicle through other means such as USB creates opportunities to hack what used to be otherwise isolated, embedded components. The formation of the SRB, that includes Intel Security, IBM, Rambus and others, is one of the first steps in addressing the multifaceted objectives of improving security in vehicles without creating barriers by understand what reference architectures are required to support enhanced integration to external networks and capabilities. Grobman said that rather than looking vulnerabilities in existing automotive systems, the focus of the SRB will be forward thinking to so it can get in front of threats and foster the development of more resilient platforms by defining reference architectures and their implementations. He said its really difficult to quantify how many players in the supply chain are involved, as different automotive manufacturers take different approaches. Some have greater flexibility to design from the ground up. Continue reading on EE Times' sister site, EBN.

Meanwhile Microsoft’s effort, which is far more refined and mature, would be better for the industrial implementations that currently define it. I’ll get to that in a moment; let’s first discuss Mixed Reality. Mixed Reality This is similar to what Microsoft called Holographics, but with one distinct difference.   Mixed reality allows real objects to interact with virtual objects in what is a VR world.  Holographics let virtual objects interact with real objects in a real world.   So, if you look at Intel’s headset, it is just like a VR headset except it has Intel’s Real Sense cameras on the front and sides.  This places the viewer in a rendered world and any real objects are seen by the cameras and integrated into that rendered world.   Microsoft’s Hololens is basically a semitransparent set of goggles; it also has cameras but they are positional, which allows rendered objects to appear like magic in the actual room you are in.  The advantage to the Intel approach is that you can create a photorealistic world based on real or imagined objects and, in theory, make each indistinguishable from the other—except nothing you see is truly real.  The advantage to Microsoft’s approach is you can actually see everything around you, even through the virtual objects, making it much safer for working on something and far less power hungry. It should also be lighter and easier to wear all day.   So if you are working on something, the Hololens is by far the most ideal solution because you can actually see what you are working on, but Intel’s Mixed Reality headset would be better if you don’t actually need to touch the physical things around you and vastly better for games which, as a result, should be more immersive.  In both cases you reduce the risk of walking or tripping on things because you can see them. The Death Of Monitors Now one of Microsoft’s presentations with Hololens is its ability to put a display on any surface, but the problem with their technology, at least in its current form, is that it doesn’t obscure what is behind it so you can see the wall behind any virtual monitor or TV you project and it just kind of floats there.   With Intel’s, since the entire scene is rendered, you not only can see a monitor like it would actually appear but you could decorate your office virtually and make it look like you were working on the bridge of a space ship, in Captain Nemo’s office under the sea, or in Jurassic Park, and it would look like a monitor or TV with no transparency.   I think, once mature, you will be able to not only have as big a display or as many as you would like, which is what is being showcased, but to actually reimagine your work or living space.  Wrapping Up:  RIP Monitors While I think we are in the last decade for monitors, resolutions and prices for this technology, not to mention weight, will likely keep our trusty monitors in place for the next 10 years.  After that though, and even before for those with the money, we’ll see a sharp decline in monitor use as they follow FAX machines, iPods and PDAs into technology obscurity.   The world is becoming virtual, and by this time next decade many of us will likely largely living in a mixed reality world and will game, work and watch TV on displays and in rooms only limited by our imaginations.   I can hardly wait.    Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Making Sense of SpaceX, Boeing and Other Mega Satellite Broadband Projects By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 SpaceX's plan to put a whopping 4,425 satellites into low earth orbit (LEO) is the boldest plan for adding global non-terrestrial broadband capacity, … Read More The Abysmal Pace of New PC Tech By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 While storylines of the death of the PC have been running since the release of the iPad and the wave of tablets, it is clear that style has overtaken … Read More Five Ways Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Customer Experience By: Special Guest    11/22/2016 AI is transforming the way companies interact with customers.

Can Intel and Microsoft Recreate the PC Market With VR? By Michael J. Miller August 17, 2016 10 Comments Intel and Microsoft seem to really want to team up to create the next-generation virtual reality platform. Watching the keynote at the Intel Developer Forum on Tuesday, what occurred most to me is how Intel and Microsoft seem to really want to team up to create the next-generation virtual reality platform, much as the two were the primary winners in the PC platform years ago. Seeing Intel CEO Brian Krzanich bring Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Windows and Devices at Microsoft, on stage to roll out the new platform brought back memories of Bill Gates and Andy Grove and the development of the whole "Wintel" platform in the 80s. Krzanich termed his vision "merged reality" to accommodate standard virtual reality (where you see a virtual world), augmented reality (where digital objects appear to exist in the physical world), and a mixed reality (where things in the real world show up in the virtual world). He began by showing off how most high-end VR headsets today run on Intel desktops, but need to be tethered. (Krzanich and Project Alloy) To go beyond this, he showed off Project Alloy, an all-in-one headset that includes computer and sensors in the headset itself. Among the unique features were 6 degrees of freedom, allowing you to move in any direction; and Intel's RealSense cameras tracking the real world around you while you're in the virtual world. One of the most interesting parts of this was being able to see your hands, and then use them to control objects in the virtual world. It's a very different concept from most of the game controllers we've seen in VR systems to date. Other features let you see people or things breaking into your virtual world if you get too close to them, so you don't run into things as you walk around in the virtual world. It's a neat idea, but of course, it will need software to make it work. That's where Microsoft comes in. Last year, Redmond introduced Windows Holographic and a developer version of HoloLens, all based on Intel's Cherry Trail platform. Now, an update for Windows coming next year will include a Windows Holographic shell, allowing you to see 2D and 3D within the same virtual world, so you can view standard "Windows apps" as well as 3D and VR titles. He showed a demo on a current Intel NUC (a tiny machine based on a Skylake processor with IRIS graphics) running at 90 frames per second. The two companies said they plan to have a common mixed reality specification ready for release by the Microsoft Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) in China in December and then move to support Project Alloy. Intel will make its Alloy platform available as an open specification for its partners by the second half of 2017. That seems like a long way out, but this is still just an emerging market. In the meantime, Krzanich showed off several other things for VR developers, like how Epic's Unreal Engine can re-render lighting in a VR scene on a system based on the Broadwell-E 10-core Extreme processor more than twice as fast as on a Core i7-6700 quad-core system. This also showed off a new version of the engine that lets you edit within the VR world directly. We also saw Intel's 360 Replay technology for sports, where an array of RealSense cameras captures the entire stadium, and lets you virtually move anywhere on court or on field, and view what is happening in a 360-degree view from any position. This was used in the NBA finals, and Intel said it is now installing the technology in stadiums across the country. Still, the concept of Intel and Microsoft working together struck me as the most interesting development. The two companies have been partners on PCs for a long time, though at times have chafed at the "Wintel" designation. When they've gone their separate ways—most notably in the mobile market—neither separately had the success they had together in PCs. In the VR/AR world, both face challenges. Facebook's Oculus platform and HTC's Vive both run on high-end Intel-based PCs today, but Oculus has a partnership with Samsung to provide Gear VR using Android and mobile phone chips that cuts out Intel and Microsoft. That platform may not have the same power, but is reaching more people. Similarly, Sony is coming out with hardware that runs on its PlayStation platform, also without Intel or Microsoft. Google recently announced the Daydream VR platform to run on top of Android. Magic Leap is creating its own environment. Right now, Windows Holographic is still in its infancy, and Project Alloy looks a bit too big and too clunky in its prototype stage. Both have a lot of work to do in the next year or so before this becomes a real platform. Then again, I remember how in the 70s and early 80s, most PCs ran Zilog Z-80s or MOS Technologies' 6502, and Apple or CP/M operating system, and Intel and Microsoft ended up in a partnership (unforeseen by matchmaker IBM) that changed the world. The question is: can they do it again? Back to top By Michael J. Miller Michael J. Miller's Forward Thinking Blog: forwardthinking.pcmag.com Michael J.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Intel to build 10nm ARM-based smartphone chips starting from LG SoCs At the Intel Developer Forum (IDF), Intel and ARM have announced an agreement to develop ARM SoCs on Intel’s 10nm process at the Intel Foundry. ARM said that it will benefit its  partners by expanding the ARM ecosystem to offer more manufacturing choices for premium mobile and consumer SoCs. It also said that all the major foundries now offer Artisan platforms apart is ARM POP technology. This offers High Performance and High Density Logic Libraries, Memory Compilers and POP IP for future ARM premium mobile cores. ARM core-optimized IP, which is called ARM POP technology on the Intel 10nm process will allow for quicker knowledge transfer, enabling customers to lower their risk in implementing the most advanced ARM cores on Intel’s edge process technology. This also enables silicon partners to accelerate the implementation and tape-outs of their ARM-based designs. The initial POP IP will be for two future advanced ARM Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either ARM big.LITTLE or stand-alone configurations. Intel also said that LG will make 64-bit ARMv8 mobile SoCs based on Intel’s 10nm design platform. The chips are expected to arrive sometime in 2017. After its failed NUCLUN chip, the 10nm chip could compete with Qualcomm Snapdragon and Samsung Exynos chip next year.

Intel says new USB Type-C spec will ease headphone jack loss Engadget 17/08/2016 Steve Dent © Provided by Engadget Judging by comments on articles about Apple's next iPhone and the Moto Z smartphone, the public is not crazy about ditching the headphone jack. However, Intel and its partners have embraced the idea, and at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF), company architects Rahman Ismail and Brad Saunders explained why. It's all about changes to the USB Type-C standard that will "really make the USB Type-C the right connector for audio," said Sanders. USB Type-C is used on Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, the OnePlus 3 and the Huawei-built Google Nexus 6P, along with the Chromebook Pixel and MacBook laptops. The Moto Z also uses it, and so far it's the only device to nix the 3.5mm audio port in favor of the newfangled connector. The idea is to get consumers to use dedicated USB Type-C or wireless headphones, or plug in an (easily lost) adapter for their traditional 3.5mm wired models. Consumers are naturally worried that such an adapter won't come in the box, meaning they won't be able to use their favorite wired phones without spending even more on a dongle. © Intel However, Saunders thinks users will come around thanks to the advantages of the updated standard for USB C. It eliminates the analog to digital circuitry needed in phones, letting manufacturers make them slimmer, he said. It would also allow for more pristine sound, noise cancelling, and effects like extra base or "concert hall" reverb. The revised spec also supports "granular" power management, letting the system shut off a microphone if you're just using your headphones for music, for instance. That should ensure that USB audio doesn't suck much more power than a headphone jack. © Intel Intel also revealed a new type of video standard that will be incorporated into USB Type-C. While not a replacement for HDMI, Ismail said "it's good enough to do productivity work or watch movies, but not for a gaming system." It'll even work if you're using a hub to plug multiple devices into a single USB Type-C port. The updated USB Type-C standard also includes device authentication, making for better security. It will be unveiled later this year, according to Intel. Like all such standards, however, there will be multiple specifications, so your phone's USB Type-C port might not have the same capability at all as the one on your laptop.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Nvidia calls out Intel for cheating in Xeon Phi vs. GPU benchmarks Nvidia claims Intel used four-year-old data to make its new chips sound better. by Sebastian Anthony (UK) - Aug 17, 2016 1:19 pm UTC Login to bookmark 55 Nvidia has called out Intel for juicing its chip performance in specific benchmarks—accusing Intel of publishing some incorrect "facts" about the performance of its long-overdue Knights Landing Xeon Phi cards. Nvidia's primary beef is with the following Intel slide, which was presented at a high performance computing conference (ISC 2016). Nvidia disputes Intel's claims that Xeon Phi provides "2.3x faster training" for neural networks and that it has "38 percent better scaling" across nodes. Enlarge At this juncture I should point out that juicing benchmarks is, rather sadly, par for the course. Whenever a chip maker provides its own performance figures, they are almost always tailored to the strength of a specific chip—or alternatively, structured in such a way as to exacerbate the weakness of a competitor's product. In this case, it looks like Intel opted for the classic using-an-old-version-of-some-benchmarking-software manoeuvre. Intel claimed that a Xeon Phi system is 2.3 times faster at training a neural network than a comparable Maxwell GPU system; Nvidia says that if Intel used an up-to-date version of the benchmark (Caffe AlexNet), the Maxwell system is actually 30 percent faster. And of course, Maxwell is Nvidia's last-gen part; the company says a comparable Pascal-based system would be 90 percent faster. On the 38-percent-better-scaling point, Nvidia says that Intel compared 32 of its new Xeon Phi servers against four-year-old Nvidia Kepler K20 servers being used in ORNL's Titan supercomputer. Nvidia states that modern GPUs, paired with a newer interconnect, scale "almost linearly up to 128 GPUs." In short, Nvidia is adamant that for high-performance computing—and specifically deep-learning applications—you should use GPUs rather than Knights Landing Xeon Phi (which is essentially 72 Atom CPUs on a chip, with two AVX-512 vector units strapped to each core that do most of the heavy lifting). We've asked Intel if it has a response or rebuttal to Nvidia's fightin' words, but haven't yet heard back. Update @ 17:30 BST. Intel responded to your request for comment with the following: "It is completely understandable that Nvidia is concerned about Intel in this space. Intel routinely publishes performance claims based on publicly available solutions at the time, and we stand by our data." This story is a fine example of why we always do our own benchmarking when reviewing products: to make sure the numbers are fair and just. Sometimes you can't even rely on benchmarks, though: over the years, both Nvidia and ATI/AMD have cheated their way to artificially high performance figures with "optimised" drivers that include code specifically for benchmarking suites like 3D Mark.

The nation's top mobile carrier said it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Intel for the collaboration based on a web-based communication technology called "Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)" during the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, Tuesday local time. The two companies also agreed to distribute development kits to speed up the expansion of the global IoT device market. "By providing software optimized for IoT devices, we will build an environment where customers can tap into Intel's technologies to the fullest," Intel Software Solution Group Vice President Michael Greene said. "Based on the two companies' IoT service development experiences and the WebRTC technology, we will push to develop and commercialize innovative IoT devices that can communicate in real time." The WebRTC technology is designed to transfer voice and video data in real time on web browsers and is based on the next-generation web standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium. With this technology, IoT devices will support voice and video communications even without smartphones. For instance, providers of online shopping and delivery services can tap into this technology for IoT devices that automatically receive orders, automating the entire process to improve customer experience, according to SK Telecom. The two companies also plan to jointly develop WebRTC-based technologies for Intel's subminiature computing IoT module named "Edison," aiming at expanding the application range of WebRTC from personal computers and smartphones to more diverse IoT devices. Earlier in December, SK Telecom introduced a technology called "PlayRTC," a modified and improved version of WebRTC, in Korea. The company said business clients will be able to launch communication services without investing much on expensive servers. "We hope the PlayRTC technology will be adopted as a tool for innovation in diverse industrial areas," SK Telecom Executive Vice President Cha In-hyok said. "We will continue to cooperate with smaller partners in research and development to boost usability of IoT devices." In June, SK Telecom reached an agreement with a Korean system software developer TOBESOFT to jointly develop and distribute IoT devices for fashion retail stores in the Dongdaemun area, eastern Seoul. The company has also provided the PlayRTC Technology to foreign startups including a Chinese education service provider HEYI since 2015. yoonsw@ktimes.com 1. Sharp cold snap grips country tomorrow 2.

IDF 2016 Intel lays out its 5G, IoT strategy Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveils Project Alloy Microsoft fleshes out its Windows 10 mixed-reality roadmap Intel, ARM forge foundry partnership in bet on manufacturing prowess Microsoft extends again support for Windows 7, 8.1 Skylake-based devices Intel taking its six-core processors mainstream in 2018 Intel CEO Brian Krzanich showed PCs powered by the new chip handling demanding tasks. These chips are so powerful that they can handle a game such as Overwatch without requiring a GPU. It's "the highest performance CPU Intel has ever built. It'll make rich experiences available to everyone," Krzanich said. "We're shipping seventh-generation Core already to our PC partners and will launch devices to consumers this fall." Kaby Lake, just like the current Skylake silicon, is a 14nm processor, but it will feature built-in support for USB-C Gen 2, and HDCP 2.2 support. It should also feature GPUs aimed specifically at handling 4K video. "Moore's Law," said Krzanich, "is far from dead." While high-end chips aren't going to reignite PC sales in any big way, these chips should be of interest to both gamers and creative types looking for hardware that can churn through demanding tasks such as video rendering, and could increase demand for high-end -- and higher profit margin -- hardware. Intel is currently shipping Kaby Lake chips to hardware makers, and devices featuring the silicon will make an appearance this fall. Build a PC using Intel's new $1,700 10-core...

Intel has set its sights on smart devices and augmented reality, with an eye on business applications, manaufacturing and industrial technology. The technology on show included Project Alloy, for augmented reality, and Intel Joule, a device to power IoT. Intel also disclosed partnerships with Microsoft, BMW and General Electric (GE) that will see its chips extend beyond datacentres and PCs. “We’re transforming into a company that powers the cloud and smart, connected devices,” said Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich. However, this is not something that Intel can do on its own, he added, and would require collaboration with industry partners and Intel’s developer community, more than 6,000 of whom were in attendance at IDF 2016. Project Alloy is touted as integrated augmented reality, which combines processing and sensors directly into the headset itself. Intel hopes this integration would enable it to be used anywhere and not limited to dedicated virtual reality suites. The head-mounted device provides six degrees of freedom for the user to move around, tracking their motion and able to sense the position of the user’s hands to allow them to interact with a virtual environment. Krzanich said Intel will provide open application programming interfaces (APIs) for Alloy, and will also open source the hardware in 2017 to enable third parties to build their own products around it. Intel partners with Microsoft Intel is working closely with long-time partner Microsoft on specifications for what it calls “mixed reality” Windows PCs and devices. Krzanich was joined on stage by Microsoft’s executive-vice president for Windows and Devices, Terry Myerson, who said the Windows 10 operating system will be updated in 2017 with a Windows Holographic shell as part of this. In a demonstration of the technology, Intel showed how Alloy could be used to mix 2D and 3D applications, enabling the user to see and interact with traditional Windows applications displayed on vertical surfaces in a virtual environment. While this is not entirely new – Microsoft gave a similar demo for its HoloLens product in 2015 – the partnership will allow augmented reality applications to run well even on mainstream PC hardware, said Intel. “We realised we could optimise hardware and software together. Our vision was aligning with that of Microsoft, so we made this ground-breaking partnership,” said Krzanich. The Joule in the crown Intel Joule is a computer module aimed at IoT applications that combines an Intel Atom processor with wireless connectivity and the firm’s RealSense depth-sensing camera technology. The company claims this makes it ideal for computer vision, robotics, drones and industrial applications. As an example of the latter, Intel said it could be worn by workers in manufacturing industries and used to monitor tasks they are performing for quality control purposes. BMW is among the industry partners hoping to develop Joule-based products. The carmaker said it is aiming to bring a fully autonomous car to market by 2021. To make this possible, you “need a supercomputer in the car,” according to Elmar Frickenstein, senior vice-president for Automated Driving at BMW. “Outside the car, you need a high performance cloud system to help with things such as swarm intelligence and route planning, plus a 5G network to enable exchange of data between cloud and car,” he added. Frickenstein arrived on stage in a BMW car that proceeded to drive itself away after he got out. Intelligence on devices Intel also announced Knowledge Builder, a tool that aims to bring greater intelligence down to the device level in IoT applications, rather than relying on back-end processing in the datacentre. Knowledge Builder lets any developer create an intelligent sensing app that runs directly on wearables based on Intel’s Curie module – a tiny system-on-a-chip – using sample data to train it. “You can teach Curie to recognise any special movement and Knowledge Builder looks at the data and develops the matching algorithm; you push that back to Curie and it can do that in real time on the device itself,” said Krzanich. General Electric’s (GE) chief executive, Jeff Immelt, said technology represented a huge opportunity to reverse declining industrial productivity. “Existing IT tools and techniques are not getting that done, so you either embrace the future or find yourself not able to satisfy the needs of your customers,” he told delegates. “The industrial world is very different to the consumer world; small changes in productivity can drive large changes in outcome for customers,” he said. “So we’re going to work together to do what we can do to drive greater efficiency for the industrial internet.” Read more about augmented reality Over the next few years, wearable tech is expected to make an impact in the consumer and enterprise market – CIOs should consider the implications. Google appears to be following Microsoft with new features to Android, including add-ons that look similar to rivals Skype, OneNote, HoloLens.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich also explained the concept of merged reality, which is different from augmented reality.  ( Intel ) Advertisement At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled Project Alloy, which is a virtual reality reference design that enables the operation of a standalone wireless VR headset. The headset made possible by Project Alloy does not need any extraneous components, working without a requirement to be connected to a PC or smartphone. The Project Alloy headset already contains the graphics and computational power necessary to construct the virtual reality environment, an internal battery pack and sensors and 3D cameras that use the RealSense motion tracking technology of Intel. In addition to unveiling Project Alloy, Krzanich also explained the concept of "merged reality," which blends what can be seen in the real world into virtual reality environments. "Merged reality will be one of those fundamental shifts that is going to redefine how we work, how we are entertained and how we communicate," Krzanich said, with the concept demonstrated by a Project Alloy headset wearer holding a real dollar bill. The wearer used the bill to carve a piece of gold on a pottery wheel in a VR environment. The RealSense technology incorporated into the Project Alloy headset can identify objects in front of the wearer. For example, users can wield a real-life tennis racket to play a game in a VR environment, and can even bring the people picked up by the headset's cameras into virtual reality. According to Intel, merged reality will address concerns that VR headsets will block out the real world, which could create potentially risky situations for the wearer. Project Alloy also eliminates the need for complicated setups such as those involving hand controllers and a good number of sensors being placed around a room. Project Alloy will not be as high definition or as precise as other VR systems such as HTC's Vive, which uses Valve's Lighthouse laser tracking system. However, the new design by Intel is a huge development in the combination of wireless and relatively cheaper VR systems such as the Samsung Gear VR featuring high-end capabilities as found in the Oculus Rift. According to Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead, merged reality would be amazing for gaming applications. Houses can be transformed into gaming levels, with players using their own hands instead of controllers and the walls being picked up by cameras and represented in the VR environment. The concept of merged reality is different from augmented reality, which is seen in Microsoft's HoloLens. While Intel's Project Alloy brings real-world objects into virtual reality, Microsoft's HoloLens does the opposite in blending virtual objects with the real world, such as allowing users to access their email inbox overlaid on what they see in the physical world. In what could be the best part about the initiative, Intel is looking to make Project Alloy an open source platform, which would allow any company to use the design as a foundation for a VR device. Intel will also be working with certain manufacturers to create Project Alloy-based headsets, with the devices to run Windows Holographic. Windows Holographic is the version of the Windows operating system that is compatible with augmented reality and virtual reality. Microsoft recently revealed that it would make the software available to devices beyond the HoloLens.

Published in Graphics Intel cheers the USB Type-C by Nick Farrell on17 August 2016 Tweet font size decrease font size increase font size Print Email Backing Apple While users and the rest of the world think Apple’s move to kill off the headphone jack is a bad idea, Intel is cheering a general move to a more mobile  USB Type-C. Intel Developer Forum (IDF) heard Intel architects Rahman Ismail and Brad Saunders saying that a general move to USB Type-C for whatever reason is a good thing. Saunders think that consumers will get used to dedicated USB Type-C thanks to the advantages of the updated standard for USB C. He said that it will kill off the need for analogue to digital decoders letting manufacturers make them slimmer. It would also allow for more pristine sound, noise cancelling, and effects like extra base or "concert hall" reverb. He said that the revised spec also supports "granular" power management, letting the system shut off a microphone if you're just using your headphones for music, for instance. This will save on power. Chipzilla also showed off a new type of video standard that will be incorporated into USB Type-C which will not replace HDMI, is good enough to do productivity work or watch movies. Ismail said that it will work if you're using a hub to plug multiple devices into a single USB Type-C port. USB Type-C standard is more secure because it includes device authentication. Like all such standards, however, there will be multiple specifications, so your phone's USB Type-C port might not be as hot as the one on your laptop.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version August 17, 2016 - 16:02 AMT SHARE Intel foundries to produce ARM-based smartphone chips Intel on Tuesday, August 16 announced it has reached an agreement with rival ARM Holdings to produce 10-nanometer ARM chip designs at its advanced fabrication facilities, a strategy targeting smartphone chipmakers, AppleInsider reports. Under the agreement, Intel Custom Foundry will be able use its upcoming 10nm FinFET platform to fabricate chip designs based on ARM's Artisan Physical IP, the companies said in joint press releases. Intel officially announced the collaboration at today's Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. For chipmakers like Qualcomm, and potentially Apple, the Intel-ARM partnership opens the door to new foundry options beyond industry stalwarts Samsung and, more recently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. As noted by Ars Technica, ARM's IP license appears to be somewhat narrow, meaning complex custom designs might not be eligible for Intel's fab. "The initial POP IP will be for two future advanced ARM Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either ARM big.LITTLE or stand-alone configurations," ARM said. South Korea's LG will be one of the first customers to use Intel's new service. The consumer electronics giant plans to produce a "world-class mobile platform" of its own design based on ARM IP, likely destined for release in a smartphone. LG traditionally turns to Qualcomm or smaller manufacturers for its chip needs. Apple is unlikely to make the switch to Intel's process anytime soon, however, as standing contracts preclude meaningful diversification. For example, TSMC is said to be taping out the design for a next-generation 10nm "A11" processor expected to go into production in 2017. SHARE PanARMENIAN.Net © 2000—2016

Referring to it as the "future of merged reality," this new head-mounted device offers untethered, immersive, self-contained VR and AR experiences powered by Intel RealSense technology. The Intel Project Alloy headset doesn't require an associated smartphone, PC, power cables, or external sensors – everything required is in the headset and it is completely wireless. The headset was briefly demonstrated on stage at the IDF. In the demo an Intel's Craig Raymond walked around the stage and navigated a virtual room. In the VR room he opened a door using hand movement/interaction. Then he walked back to Mr Krzanich, and the CEO's face appeared in the mixed reality environment so he didn't walk into him… As mentioned in the CNet produced video above, Project Alloy is a reference design that Intel will provide to other manufacturers. The first products based on the design aren't expected until sometime next year. Unfortunately there is not much information available about the hardware. We know the headset contains a pair of RealSense cameras to track the real-world, just like the rhino horn add-on for the HTC Vive we saw teased recently. However it would be more interesting to find out about the CPU, GPU and battery life of the Project Alloy reference design. Windows Holographic In related news Microsoft announced it is collaborating with Intel "on a specification for mixed reality ready PCs and head mounted displays (HMDs)." It intends to help make a standard for hardware/software developers which will be released and supported by Mainstream PCs powered by Windows 10 next year. The core application using the AR/VR hardware will be the Windows Holographic shell. This program "enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices". Below is a video of a Windows 10 holographic UI experience, running on an HMD tethered to an Intel NUC providing 90fps.

Analysts said the comments by Mark Bohr, Intel's Director of Process Architecture and a familiar figure in the industry, were no cause for alarm, but shares fell 4.5 percent to 93.54 euros by 1130 GMT in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Intel holds a 15 percent stake in ASML and is a key customer for its lithography machines which use focused light beams to map out the circuitry of computer chips. Speaking at an event in San Francisco, Bohr said Intel would initially rely on older ASML tools at Intel's 7 nm fabrication plants, switching only to ASML's newest EUV tools when they are deemed ready. EUV stands for "extreme ultraviolet"-range light waves. ASML dominates the market for lithography machines, but it is counting on adoption of the EUV machines -- which can cost up to 100 million euros ($113 million) each -- to increase sales to a target of 10 billion euros by 2020. Bernstein analysts said Bohr's comments did not appear to mark a major change. "Intel would never bet unequivocally on an unproven technology," Stacy Ragson wrote in a note on Intel's presentation. "Dr. Bohr's comments, while perhaps a bit more direct than what might have been perceived before, should not have been surprising." Bernstein rates ASML shares "Outperform". ASML still expects EUV machines to enter production in 2018 and be running at full volume by 2019, company spokesman Lucas van Grinsven said. Analyst Jos Versteeg from Dutch private bank Theodoor Gilissen, said Wednesday's share decline presented investors with a "nice purchasing moment." "Even if EUV were delayed, that wouldn't be bad for ASML's results, given that many more (current generation) systems would have to be sold" to compensate, he said. ASML is on Gilissen's list of "Recommended" stocks.

In partnership with Intel, the company will allow you to run holographic apps on your mainstream computer. Microsoft made the announcement at Intel's Developer Forum in San Francisco this week. Next year's Redstone 2 update to Windows 10 will introduce the Windows Holographic shell to every PC currently running the operating system. This will turn the millions of Windows 10 devices in use today into machines capable of running mixed reality applications. The Window Holographic Shell is the component of Windows 10 that allows mixed reality, holographic apps to run on a headset. At present, it is used for Microsoft's HoloLens. It powers the HoloLens' interface, providing a customised version of Windows 10 more suited to mixed reality. It also makes it possible to run Universal Windows apps that have been enhanced with mixed reality features. By bringing the holographic shell to all Windows 10 PCs, Microsoft will allow consumers to run holographic content on a much broader range of hardware. You'll be able to buy a mixed reality headset that's compatible with Microsoft's Windows Holographic platform and power it from a Windows 10 device you already own. In a demonstration with Intel, Microsoft showed a tiny Intel NUC mini-PC running a holographic experience at 90fps. Skype for Microsoft HoloLens Microsoft The development marks the widening of Microsoft's holographic ambitions. HoloLens is already part of the Universal Windows family but it currently runs its own specialised version of Windows 10. With next year's update, that will change. The holographic platform will be able to run atop a standard Windows 10 installation, enabling Microsoft to push it to the millions of consumer and enterprise PCs already in use. HoloLens will no longer need its customised Windows version. Because the holographic components will become part of the stock Windows 10 installation, HoloLens will be able to use the same version of Windows as every other device. The only difference will be in the shell it loads once started up. The Windows "shell" refers to the interface used to interact with your device. On a desktop PC, you get the Windows Explorer shell, which includes things like the taskbar, Start menu and desktop itself. The HoloLens has its own shell that's far more headset-friendly than the small icons and menus of desktop Windows. It supports voice and gesture input and scales appropriately for a headset's display. Outlook Mail and Calendar for Microsoft HoloLens Microsoft With next year's Windows 10 update, this specialist holographic shell will be installed on all Windows 10 PCs. By default, the desktop environment will still be used. The holographic shell's presence allows you to connect a head-mounted display, such as an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, and use the Windows Holographic environment, without attaching any other hardware. When you connect a compatible device to your PC, everything will "just work." Windows 10 will be able to detect that you've connected a headset to your display port and will launch the holographic shell rather than the desktop environment. The standalone HoloLens approach will no longer be required as every PC will come with Windows Holographic preinstalled. Microsoft is also working with Intel to build a specification for mixed reality PCs and headsets. It wants to build a "broad range of devices" with its hardware partners that are able to support the Windows Holographic Shell. One of the first headsets will be Intel's own Project Alloy, a wireless device unveiled this week that is built with Windows Holographic in mind. Microsoft's decision to install Windows Holographic on every Windows 10 PC indicates its commitment to making mixed reality applications mainstream. Using a Windows-powered mixed reality headset will be as simple as connecting it to your existing Windows 10 device, enabling you to run augmented Windows Store apps within the holographic shell.

The chipmaker has announced that it will be adding digital audio to the USB-C spec later this year, reports CNET, and that this will be ‘the right connector for audio’ … At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail sketched out a coming USB audio standard that could help push the 3.5mm jack aside. The new specification, due this quarter, adds features to ensure a USB headphone doesn’t drain too much battery power and defines how buttons for pausing music or lowering volume work. The work “will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio,” Saunders said. Intel is also adding a new video standard to USB-C, intended to replace HDMI for running standard apps and watching movies, but without offering the frame-rate needed for gaming. Finally, the updated spec will also add device authentication for improved security. Apple is of course no stranger to standing apart from other manufacturers in using its own connectors, having developed the 30-pin dock connector for the first iPod and used it for early iPhones and iPads before switching to the equally proprietary Lightning socket. But with the company seemingly standardizing on the USB-C connector for its MacBook range, it is something of a shame that it isn’t doing the same for iPhones. It seems unlikely that Apple will make the switch from Lightning to USB-C in iOS devices. The company attracted a great many complaints when it abandoned the 30-pin socket, with many having to replace sometimes-expensive accessories like speaker docks, so a second switch soon after pushing Lightning as an audio standard would seem a virtual impossibility from a PR perspective. All the same, Intel’s backing for digital audio is likely to lead to other manufacturers also abandoning the 3.5mm headphone socket, making Apple’s move seem less controversial over time. Motorola/Lenovo has already done so with the Moto Z, offering a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, while audio companies are already offering USB-C headphones. Lightning headphones have of course already been available for some time.   Guides iPhone View THe Guide USB-C View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo 1/2 left right The Cisco Systems logo is seen as part of a display at the Microsoft Ignite technology conference in Chicago, Illinois, May 4, 2015. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo 2/2 Cisco Systems Inc is laying off about 14,000 employees, representing nearly 20 percent of the network equipment maker's global workforce, technology news site CRN reported, citing sources close to the company. Cisco, which is due to report fourth-quarter results later on Wednesday, is expected to announce the cuts within the next few weeks, the report said. (bit.ly/2bEQfa3) "We think it's true," Jefferies analysts wrote in a client note, referring to the report. "As we've met with investors in recent weeks, we've picked up on concerns that Cisco may be looking to reduce headcount in the not-too-distant future." If confirmed, it would be the second big tech industry layoff of a similar scale announced this year. Intel Corp said in April that it would slash up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce. San Jose-based Cisco is facing sluggish spending by telecom carriers and enterprises on network switches and routers, its main business. In response, the company has been beefing up its wireless security and datacenter businesses. These rumored cuts, if they turn out to be true, would be a bit of a catch-up the company is doing as it moves away from hardware, Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson said. "I do not think that they are going to be done after this," Henderson said. The company has already offered many early retirement packages to employees, the CRN report said. Cisco, which had more than 70,000 employees as of April 30, declined to comment. The company's shares were down 1.4 percent at $30.71 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq. Jefferies raised its price target on the stock to $35 from $30.72 and maintained its "buy" rating. Up to Tuesday's close, Cisco's stock had risen about 15 percent this year, compared with a 10.5 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Hardware & Equipment index.

Though it remains king of PC processors, growth has stagnated, forcing the company to compete in new areas. We’ve seen it dabble all over the last few years: the cloud, robots, wearables, connected appliances, automation, 3D cameras, and much more. Often, the demos feel a bit half-baked. This year’s Intel Developers Forum, which kicked off Tuesday, was different. Intel has decided to elbow into virtual reality, one of tech’s hottest trends. And the technology it showed off is more game-changer than gimmick. It was all building up to this RealSense, Intel’s 3D camera technology, has existed for several years, and the company has tried time and time again to re-frame it in the context of new technologies — with limited success. While it seems a promising way give drones perception of their surroundings, it has never taken off in PCs, tablets, or smartphones. It’s time to forget all that. Virtual reality is booming, and RealSense gives Intel a unique new tool in the space. To prove it, Intel took the wraps off Project Alloy headset at Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco. Alloy flips the current script for building a VR headset. Front-runners like HTC’s Vive and Oculus’ Rift work by using external sensor stations to track the your headset and controllers. Intel eliminates these by instead using a RealSense camera. It scans the world around you to understand how you’re moving through a room. Better still, the camera can track your hands, so you can interact with virtual objects naturally. Related: How Intel’s RealSense is coming of age That’s a big deal. Suddenly, room-scale VR becomes possible without any of the tedious installation and setup, and without controls you may accidentally fling across the room. Alloy even allows real objects to bleed into the virtual realm. You can see your real hands — or your cat, just moments before your trip over her. In essence, it’s a superior version of the Vive’s chaperone system, which works well but doesn’t provide the same level of detail. Not ready for consumers, but that’s OK Intel didn’t provide an exact release date or pricing for Alloy, and said that it won’t be out until late 2017. That may seem an annoying delay, but it matters less than it seems. Alloy, like a lot of products built by Intel, is not being designed to compete with the Rift or Vive directly. Instead, it’s appealing to Oculus and HTC, showing each an alternative way to build their hardware — with Intel inside. Intel does this all the time. In the past the company has shown laptop testbeds, the Next Unit of Computing, wearable bracelets, and more. Often, these “products” are never actually sold. Even when they are – as with the Next Unit of Computing – they’re barely advertised. This may seem a silly tactic, but it works. Just have a look at the hordes of NUC and Compute Stick look-alikes that swarm Amazon, Newegg, and Alibaba. Even the modern 2-in-1 notebooks built by Dell, HP, and others owe a lot to early design prototypes built by Intel and shown at major press events. Intel Project AlloyMore It’s important to understand Alloy’s really purpose. Taken on its own, it’s not hard to criticize. While no one has had hands-on time with it yet, it’s clearly a large device, and probably quite heavy. We don’t know anything about its latency, its resolution, or the power of the compute hardware Intel says is inside it. I suspect that, despite its advanced technology, the experience of using Alloy is quite far behind the Rift and Vive. Read More But that’s not the point. Alloy isn’t something Intel wants you to find on the shelf at Best Buy. It’s a development tool used to illustrate the potential of its own technology, when properly used. In that context, Alloy is the coolest project Intel has shown in years. The next step Though Project Alloy stole the show at IDF 2016, it was just part of a broader platform of development sessions conducted during the conference. A number of technical sessions covered a range of topics, including ideas for taking VR mainstream and the “sensification” of VR. Related: Intel’s 7th-gen Core prepares for fall 2016 launch As always, Intel has a horse in this race. The company seems to be pushing for solutions that include some kind of processor in the headset to offload certain tasks, like calculating a headset’s position in a room. Intel would love for VR developers to decide they need an Atom or Core chip inside their headset to accelerate the experience. That may prove a stretch. But Intel’s not entirely selfish. The company has always proven capable of working with partners to push new standards, from USB to Thunderbolt. Virtual reality is no different. Intel, in partnership with Microsoft and others, is expected to publish a new base-level set of recommended specifications for enabling “merged reality” experiences. And that’s just one initiative of many. I’m excited to see Intel embrace virtual reality, and augmented reality, in a big, comfy bear hug. The company’s previous mentions of the topic were bare bones – usually nothing more than a reminder that Intel processors are best for gaming rigs built power the Rift and Vive. But at IDF 2016, Intel committed fully to the VR revolution, and it will prove a powerful ally. Close to the Metal Ep. 8: Intel joins the VR revolution Look ma, no wires!

X Intel’s chips deal with ARM helps it into the mobile market As the PC market declines in favour of tablets and smartphones, Intel needs help switching Wed, Aug 17, 2016, 11:30 Updated: Wed, Aug 17, 2016, 15:12 Ciara O'Brien Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (left) and technical marketing engineer Craig Raymond demonstrate its Project Alloy virtual reality headset: the company is a major employer in Ireland so we have an interest in its success. Photograph: Intel Corporation/EPA         The news that Intel had signed a deal with ARM to produce its rivals chips may be seen by some as an admission of defeat of sorts. At one point, Intel was trying to crack that market with its own line of mobile focused chips, hoping to replicate its success in the PC market in the new generation of mobile devices. It needed to make the change. Intel still gets much of its revenue from the ever declining PC market, which hit a peak five years ago and has been on a steady fall ever since. Hastening its demise is the new generation of internet connected devices: tablets and smartphones. The impact has been huge: by the end of 2016, experts believe the PC market will have 100 million units less than the 2011 high. It should have been an easy transition for Intel. The company was once the undisputed king of the chip makers. If you had a PC, chances are there was an Intel chip running it. Consumers knew and trusted the name. Many could repeat the little chime that ran at the end of PC television ads along with the “Intel Inside” log. Times have changed. The shift from PCs and laptops to tablets and mobiles has left the company appearing to flounder, unable to find a solid enough footing in the market. Intel has, by and large, missed the mobile boat. And yet it has 10 nanometer production lines that could be put to good use in making chips. Intel strikes technology licensing deal with ARM Intel to buy startup Nervana System to add cloud service Strong microchip sales help Intel post 2.6% rise in revenue With its PC business diminishing, something needed to give. Licensing technology from third-party rivals will give Intel a way into the mobile industry. Mobile market domination ARM on the other hand has dominated the mobile industry. Its chip design is used by Apple, Samsung, Nvidia and Qualcomm among others. ARM-based chips are in iPads, iPhones, most Android phones, even Kindles. Largely flying under the radar with consumers, the Cambridge-based company has got itself into a nice position, and it was one that even the might of Intel couldn’t conquer. ADVERTISEMENT So the deal with ARM makes sense for Intel. It could lead to more business with Qualcomm and Apple, putting Intel at the heart of the mobile industry, a position it has tried – and failed – to reach under its own steam. Intel is still a major player in the chip space. The company makes 80 per cent of the chips that run the world’s servers, but rivals have designs on its territory. AMD, once considered a major rival for Intel in the server industry recently announced plans to downgrade its ARM chips and return to x86 chips. As a major employer in Ireland, we have a vested interest in Intel’s success. The company employs around 5,000 people in its plant in Leixlip, and has invested more than $12.5 billion (€11bn) in the facility over more than 25 years. But not everything has been positive. Earlier this year the company announced it was cutting 11 per cent of its global workforce – 12,000 jobs – and some of that would be in Ireland. Indirectly, the company also suffered a defeat when a case brought to the Supreme Court by farmer Thomas Reid against a compulsory purchase order by the IDA for his family’s land, beside the Leixlip campus, was decided in favour of the farmer. There is a bit of optimism though. Under chief executive Brian Krzanich, the company has been pushing into new markets. Keen to take advantage of the growing trend for the Internet of Things and to avoid a repeat of the mobile strategy fiasco, Intel has shown off chips that are the size of a button and could cost as little as $10. The Irish operation has played a part in the design of these systems through its work on the Quark chip and the Gallileo board. Strongholds The cheaper chips won’t be as lucrative as the company’s former product strongholds. The Internet of Things only accounts for 4 per cent of the company’s sales, and with the cost per chip much lower than the PC or server business, it will take a lot of Internet of Things adoption for Intel to reach its previous heights. That’s not all Intel is getting involved in. At the Intel developer forum, the company showed off a virtual reality headset that removes the wired connection to a computer and allows objects from the real world to be integrated in the digital. It uses an array of cameras and sensors that also allow the user to move throughout multiple rooms and interact with objects. “Project Alloy takes the cord off the VR headset,” said Mr Krzanich. “To me that’s what virtual reality means.” The design is set to be open-source material, so developers can put their own spin on it. Intel is making the right noises at least. The Internet of Things is expected to grow to more than 30 billion devices by 2020, about treble its size in 2015. Getting in there early will – hopefully – stop the mistakes of Intel’s mobile era repeating themselves.       Topics: Brian Kzranich Thomas Reid AMD Apple Intel Nvidia Qualcomm Samsung Leixlip Read More Intel considering sale of cybersecurity unit Final wave of Intel staff in Ireland leaves in restructuring Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Photograph: Intel/EPA Samuel Gibbs Wednesday 17 August 2016 06.27 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 17 August 2016 09.08 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 3 months old Intel has unveiled its next evolution of virtual-reality goggles Project Alloy for so-called mixed reality, which drags real-world objects into the virtual realm using 3D cameras. The new head-mounted display consists of a set of goggles that resemble the likes of Facebook’s Oculus Rift or HTC’s Vive VR headsets, but they do not need to be connected by a series of cables to a computer. Instead, they contain the computing power needed to run the headset in the headset. The headset uses Intel’s RealSense cameras, which have depth-sensing capabilities, to allow, without the need for additional sensors, objects such as the user’s hands to be tracked and entered into the virtual world displayed within the goggles. Most other VR headsets, including Sony’s upcoming PSVR, require a series of cameras, sensors and accessories to be placed about a room or held in the hand to enable similar functions. Intel’s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, said: “Merged reality delivers virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before – and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible. “Pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually on to the court at Wimbledon. Be the ultimate concert master – fully unplugged. Plan your virtual visit to the Sistine Chapel while never leaving the office. Experience a sporting event, a concert or a film scene from any point of view – and from any position.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Project Alloy headset will not require a tether to a computer. Photograph: Intel Intel is keen to place itself at the heart of the next stage of VR technology, having missed out on the mobile space now dominated by designs developed by rival ARM. The US chip giant recently pulled out of the smartphone chip market, unable to gain traction after starting late and failing to meet the power efficiency and capability of ARM designs made by Samsung, Qualcomm, Apple and others used in billions of mobile devices world wide. It also announced a deal to manufacturer ARM designs in its plants. While Facebook’s Oculus, HTC and Google, with its Cardboard smartphone-powered VR system, have a head start, Intel hopes its work with companies Daqri, its RealSense 3D cameras and processor technology will become essential to the next generation of VR and AR systems currently in development. Intel has backing from Microsoft, which announced it will support Project Alloy with its Windows Holographic system. The software is in development with Microsoft’s own AR solution, Hololens. VR and AR systems, yet to go mainstream, are held back by capability, cost and the social stigma displayed towards devices such as Google’s Glass smartglasses. This year should see more affordable yet capable systems, including Sony’s PSVR and Google’s Daydream, enter the market, attracting users put off by the high price of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, which both require a plethora of sensors and a very powerful Windows PC to power them. But given the failure of technology with similar burdens of having to wear glasses or apparatus, such as 3D TV, whether VR and AR systems will become a mass-market item remains to be seen.

(Intel Corporation) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Intel RealSense technology VR virtual reality Israeli-developed technology took center stage at Intel’s annual Developer Forum in San Francisco Tuesday as the company unveiled its new virtual/augmented reality system, code-named Project Alloy. The system was introduced by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in his keynote address at the event as an “all in one, self-contained virtual reality solution made from the ground up.” Along with the new product, Intel introduced a new term — “merged reality” — which is where the Israeli part of Alloy comes in. While most virtual reality systems today are totally immersive, meaning you can get “lost” in the virtual world, Alloy allows users to integrate elements of the real world in an experience. “Through merged reality, see your hands, see your friends … see the wall you are about to run into,” according to Intel. “Not only can you see these elements from the real world, but you can use your hands to interact with elements of your virtual world, merging realities.” Alloy does this using Intel’s RealSense technology, a version of advanced gesture-based computing that allows users to interact with the camera and computers — for example, enabling them to change TV channels by moving their fingers in the air. Developed largely at Intel’s Haifa research labs, RealSense sees the distance between objects and separates objects from the background layers behind them. This visual data provides much better object, facial and gesture recognition than a traditional camera, according to the company, and creates a touch-free interface that responds to hand, arm, and head motions as well as facial expressions. RealSense is at the heart of Alloy’s self-contained AR/VR system – the first one that “operates without pesky cords dangling from your VR headset connecting to the computer,” according to Intel. Other popular VR systems, like the Oculus Rift, are tethered to a PC, making their deployment in a true AR/VR world environment limited. The RealSense-based Alloy Head-Mounted Device (HMD) allows users to move around with the headset on, but also features collision detection and avoidance, enabling the user to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space. “Alloy’s merged reality is made possible by Intel RealSense cameras attached to the headset and is not dependent on setting up any external sensors or cameras around the room,” said the company. While it now belongs to the world, RealSense is a sabra at heart, according to senior Intel engineer Igal Iancu. “Israel is a hub of innovation in machine vision, chip development, and 3D technology. Israel was the natural place for the development of RealSense, which combines hardware and software to bring human-like senses to personal devices, so they can experience the world like we do.” Alloy, said Krzanich, does exactly that. “We can take the virtual world into the real world. You can interact with the virtual world. We believe the capabilities Alloy introduces is truly significant,” he said in his address. “The Alloy platform completely redefines what is possible in an all-in-one VR platform.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Intel,  RealSense technology,  VR virtual reality,  merged reality,  Intel Haifa R&D center More in Israel Inside Housing prices continue to climb, despite reforms Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Israeli researchers: Snoops can hack your headphones to record conversations By Sue Surkes   New competition to boost Israel insurance tech scene By Shoshanna Solomon   Who is rich?

Though it remains king of PC processors, growth has stagnated, forcing the company to compete in new areas. We’ve seen it dabble all over the last few years: the cloud, robots, wearables, connected appliances, automation, 3D cameras, and much more. Often, the demos feel a bit half-baked. This year’s Intel Developers Forum, which kicked off Tuesday, was different. Intel has decided to elbow into virtual reality, one of tech’s hottest trends. And the technology it showed off is more game-changer than gimmick. It was all building up to this RealSense, Intel’s 3D camera technology, has existed for several years, and the company has tried time and time again to re-frame it in the context of new technologies — with limited success. While it seems a promising way give drones perception of their surroundings, it has never taken off in PCs, tablets, or smartphones. Intel has flipped the script for building a VR headset. It’s time to forget all that. Virtual reality is booming, and RealSense gives Intel a unique new tool in the space. To prove it, Intel took the wraps off Project Alloy headset at Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco. Alloy flips the current script for building a VR headset. Front-runners like HTC’s Vive and Oculus’ Rift work by using external sensor stations to track the your headset and controllers. Intel eliminates these by instead using a RealSense camera. It scans the world around you to understand how you’re moving through a room. Better still, the camera can track your hands, so you can interact with virtual objects naturally. Related: How Intel’s RealSense is coming of age That’s a big deal. Suddenly, room-scale VR becomes possible without any of the tedious installation and setup, and without controls you may accidentally fling across the room. Alloy even allows real objects to bleed into the virtual realm. You can see your real hands — or your cat, just moments before your trip over her. In essence, it’s a superior version of the Vive’s chaperone system, which works well but doesn’t provide the same level of detail. Not ready for consumers, but that’s OK Intel didn’t provide an exact release date or pricing for Alloy, and said that it won’t be out until late 2017. That may seem an annoying delay, but it matters less than it seems. Alloy isn’t something Intel wants you to find on the shelf at Best Buy. It’s a development tool. Alloy, like a lot of products built by Intel, is not being designed to compete with the Rift or Vive directly. Instead, it’s appealing to Oculus and HTC, showing each an alternative way to build their hardware — with Intel inside. Intel does this all the time. In the past the company has shown laptop testbeds, the Next Unit of Computing, wearable bracelets, and more. Often, these “products” are never actually sold. Even when they are – as with the Next Unit of Computing – they’re barely advertised. This may seem a silly tactic, but it works. Just have a look at the hordes of NUC and Compute Stick look-alikes that swarm Amazon, Newegg, and Alibaba. Even the modern 2-in-1 notebooks built by Dell, HP, and others owe a lot to early design prototypes built by Intel and shown at major press events. It’s important to understand Alloy’s really purpose. Taken on its own, it’s not hard to criticize. While no one has had hands-on time with it yet, it’s clearly a large device, and probably quite heavy. We don’t know anything about its latency, its resolution, or the power of the compute hardware Intel says is inside it. I suspect that, despite its advanced technology, the experience of using Alloy is quite far behind the Rift and Vive. But that’s not the point. Alloy isn’t something Intel wants you to find on the shelf at Best Buy. It’s a development tool used to illustrate the potential of its own technology, when properly used. In that context, Alloy is the coolest project Intel has shown in years. The next step Though Project Alloy stole the show at IDF 2016, it was just part of a broader platform of development sessions conducted during the conference. A number of technical sessions covered a range of topics, including ideas for taking VR mainstream and the “sensification” of VR. Related: Intel’s 7th-gen Core prepares for fall 2016 launch As always, Intel has a horse in this race. The company seems to be pushing for solutions that include some kind of processor in the headset to offload certain tasks, like calculating a headset’s position in a room. Intel would love for VR developers to decide they need an Atom or Core chip inside their headset to accelerate the experience. That may prove a stretch. But Intel’s not entirely selfish. The company has always proven capable of working with partners to push new standards, from USB to Thunderbolt. Virtual reality is no different. Intel, in partnership with Microsoft and others, is expected to publish a new base-level set of recommended specifications for enabling “merged reality” experiences. And that’s just one initiative of many. I’m excited to see Intel embrace virtual reality, and augmented reality, in a big, comfy bear hug. The company’s previous mentions of the topic were bare bones – usually nothing more than a reminder that Intel processors are best for gaming rigs built power the Rift and Vive. But at IDF 2016, Intel committed fully to the VR revolution, and it will prove a powerful ally.

Google Pixel: Devices are a dangerous distraction from the new AI interface Will 5G give Samsung a chance at global Radio Access Network glory? Analysis Artificial intelligence and machine learning engines are underpinning many emerging applications and services, from making sense of big data for enterprises, to supporting hyper-personalized consumer content, or virtual reality gaming. The current challenge is to move AI from the supercomputer to the mobile device, supporting technologies like computer vision locally on the handset, car, camera or VR headset. Qualcomm has been a leader here, but the past weeks have seen Intel and its Chinese partner Rockchip invest in chip-level computer vision and AI capabilities, while Apple has acquired machine learning startup Turi, presumably to enhance its AI-driven personal assistant Siri. Rockchip licenses CEVA XM4 Rockchip has licensed the XM4 imaging and vision DSP (digital signal processor) design from IP provider CEVA, to enhance these aspects of its system-on-chip (SoC) products. It says it will enable advanced vision features at the low power levels required for mobile devices, supporting digital video stabilization, object detection and tracking, and 3D depth sensing, among others. Rockchip’s CMO, Feng Chen, said in a statement that the firm wanted to “embrace the potential of computational photography, computer vision and machine learning in our product designs, seamlessly handling even the most complex use cases and algorithms”. This is not just about vision – the XM4 also targets augmented reality, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and other applications, offloading these computationally intensive tasks from the CPU or GPU; and it will enable Rockchip to use the machine learning capabilities of CEVA’s Deep Neural Network (CDNN2) framework. Intel buys Nervana Intel, which is an investor in Rockchip, has AI ambitions of its own, many focused on the massive cloud platforms which will boost its core server chip business, but it is also investing heavily in client-side capabilities such as intelligent assistants (increasingly a key interface to the smart home and car) and virtual reality. It is spending $400m to acquire AI start-up Nervana, which should be particularly valuable for its work in intelligent cars. In July, Intel announced a new partnership with BMW and Mobileye focused on driverless vehicles, with Mobileye providing the detection capabilities. Nervana could add a far greater level of intelligence or "brainpower" to the car platform. But Intel’s bigger agenda, as EETimes points out, is likely to be to sideline the GPU (graphics processor unit) as the workhorse of ma-chine learning platforms. Nvidia has stolen a march on Intel in high end GPUs, threatening the larger firm’s incumbency in supercomputers. If the move away from GPUs and towards specialized processors, for AI, accelerates, it will benefit Intel. Nervana has already mounted a credible challenge to Nvidia’s CUDA software, which powers its GPUs, with its own Neon cloud service (which is CUDA-compatible). And it has its own deep learning accelerator chip on the drawing board, and set to launch next year. Both these offerings could gain far greater power with Intel behind them, and could enable the US giant to offer AI accelerate boards to challenge Nvidia’s GPU boards, while enhancing Neon to outperform CUDA too. Intel will incorporate Nervana's algorithms into its Math Kernel Library for integration with its industry standard frameworks, and it can add Nvidia-compatible deep learning to its portfolio of cloud services. The upcoming Nervana chip, called Engine, promises an 8Tbps multichip module with terabytes of 3D memory surrounding a 3D fabric of connected neurons, each using low precision floating point units (FPUs). This design enables it to conduct far more deep learning calculations-per-second on a smaller chip than general purpose GPUs, says the firm. Karl Freund, senior analyst for at Moor Insights & Strategy, told EETimes: “GPUs are the prominent way to train deep learning neural networks and Nvidia is the leader. Intel has its multicore Xeons and Xeon Phi and with the acquisition of Altera, its FPGAs, but it doesn't have GPUs. Acquiring Nervana is a way of getting into the deep learning market not by copying the general purpose GPU strategy, but by offering a specialized coprocessor specifically designed for neural networks." Qualcomm’s Zeroth With specialized deep learning chips being deployed from supercomputers to cars to handsets, the competition will only heat up, and Nvidia may respond with its own offering. At the mobile end, Qualcomm has been highly active in this area with its Zeroth machine learning platform, which can be embedded in the Snapdragon SoC. Initially, Qualcomm’s Zeroth/Snapdragon work focused on bringing AI algorithms and vision processing to cars, but many other applications are in its sights, as highlighted by its recently announced deep learning software developers’ kit (SDK) for the Snapdragon 820 SoC. Called the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine, the SDK is an attempt by Qualcomm to expand beyond its core smartphone markets – by enticing automotive, industrial, and IoT developers to its Snapdragon platform. It also sees the chip supplier looking for broader market reach, and accelerated uptake, by enabling a great deal of its brain-like functionality in software. Back in May 2014, when Qualcomm first introduced the Zeroth project, the goal was to build a neural processing unit (NPU) that would be a hardware module for its advanced SoCs. But dedicated hardware not only adds to cost and power consumption for mobile devices, but raises barriers to developer support. So the new SDK for the neuromorphic Zeroth Machine Intelligence Platform – Qualcomm’s equivalent of IBM’s TrueNorth chip – aims to bring the hardware-specific functions of these brain chips to a more general purpose Snapdragon platform. This will help mobile devices to leverage the potential of silicon that acts in a manner somewhat akin to the human brain. While IBM is planning on shipping its brain chips to end-customers, who will put them to use in servers, the Qualcomm approach relies on software to bring those capabilities to a far more adaptable chipset – one that can be used in mobile devices, industrial IoT endpoints and vehicles. Apple makes latest AI-related acquisition The makers of those endpoints and devices will also be taking a keen interest. Apple has made its latest AI-related acquisition, paying $200m for machine learning startup Turi. Turi offers tools for developers to embed machine learning into applications which automatically scale and tune. Use cases for the technology include product recommendations, sentiment analysis and churn prediction. It is not yet clear whether these capabilities will be used for in-house developments or made available to iOS developers, but Apple CEO Tim Cook has identified AI as a key way to improve the customer experience of the firm’s devices and software – and of course, it is vital for Apple to continue to lead in user experience and keep customers as addicted to its home, auto and IoT offerings as they are to its phones. It seems likely that Turi’s ability to analyse sentiment could be harnessed to improve Siri’s intelligence and responsiveness, extending it beyond the startup’s current fairly basic applications. On the company’s most recent earnings call, Cook said: “These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial intelligence. We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience.” During the briefing, Cook highlighted the potential for Siri to not only understand words from the user, but also identify the sentiment. The acquisition of Turi could be a link between a relatively simplistic function currently, to one which can more effectively predict what the consumer wants and better refine search results. “We’re also using machine learning in many other ways across our products and services, including recommending songs, apps, and news,” said Cook on the call. “Machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word choice while typing in messages and mail, and providing context awareness in maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery life. Most of the AI processing takes place on the device rather than being sent to the cloud.” Formerly known as Dato, Seattle-based Turi raised more than $25m from venture capital investors including New Enterprise Associates and Madrona Venture Group. AI has been at the heart of several of Apple’s 15 acquisitions of the past 18 months, including speech recognition firm VocalIQ, image recognition specialist Perceptio, and facial recognition business Emotient.

The headset uses an all-in-one wireless design and operates independently of a PC, allowing you to move freely in VR. Project Alloy, a 1st gen #VR solution - imagine merging realities and experience your world differently #IDF16 pic.twitter.com/ZUrKDZ57hT— Intel (@intel) August 16, 2016 The device was unveiled by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich during the opening keynote of the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday. Intel said it has been built "from the ground up" to offer a glimpse into the future of merged reality. Alloy is an all-in-one VR platform that includes elements of augmented reality, overlaying nearby objects from the real word onto its computer-generated imagery. Alloy's key capability is its wireless nature. Unlike rivals such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, you don't need to connect the headset to a powerful computer using an unwieldy cable. Instead, all the computing power required to power Alloy is stored inside the headset itself. This lets you "cut the VR cord" and experience virtual reality without being tethered to your PC, affording a free range of motion across a much larger area than Alloy's rivals. To ensure you don't bump into things in the real world while in a virtual space, Intel has added collision detection and avoidance technology. This overlays images of nearby objects onto the headset's display as you approach them, keeping you aware of your surroundings. The result is a headset that allows you to experience the full 6 degrees-of-motion in a wireless virtual environment. Intel's Project Alloy mixed reality headset Intel Corporation Alloy has another advantage over its competitors. Existing room-sized virtual reality experiences, such as the HTC Vive, require external sensor towers be set up in the room to detect where you are at any given time. Alloy does away with this, instead working out for itself where it is positioned. This is made possible by a set of Intel RealSense cameras mounted on the headset. Intel's RealSense technology is a depth-sensing system that uses a combination of three cameras to image physical objects in 3D. The same system powers the collision avoidance mechanisms. RealSense scans the space ahead of it for obstructions. If an object is detected, it can be scanned and inserted into the real world as a 3D object. Intel's Project Alloy mixed reality headset Intel Corporation In another unique capability, Alloy is able to detect its wearer's hand movements directly. Other headsets are operated using handheld motion controllers, restricting the player and making them feel more tied into VR. Alloy uses its RealSense cameras to monitor your finger movements, displaying them in the VR landscape and allowing you to interact with virtual objects with nothing more than your hands. In a blog post on Medium, Krzanich described Alloy as the "best of all worlds." He explained how he sees merged reality as a way to deliver virtual experiences more "dynamically and naturally" than ever before, combining augmented and virtual reality tech in a way few other companies have done so far. "With increased mobility, integrated tracking and highly sensing human motion capabilities, merged reality will profoundly impact the way we work, how we are entertained and how we communicate," Krzanich said. "We’re rapidly moving toward a world where the boundary between the digital and the physical is eroding, and merging in new exciting ways." Intel Project Alloy mixed reality headset Intel Corporation Alloy may be innovative but Intel is far from the only company working in the field. Coming somewhat late to the game, it's already behind the established Oculus Rift and HTC Vive desktop headsets. Mobile offerings such as Samsung's Gear VR are also proving popular. With rival ecosystems springing up from a multitude of companies, there may not be an opportunity for Intel's latecomer platform to gain wide adoption. Intel's still a long way off launching Alloy. It is currently targeting the second half of 2017. When the headset arrives, it won't be carrying Intel's own name. Instead, it will publish the hardware specifications required to build the device and allow other companies to create their own versions based on it. No pricing information is currently available.

Image via Intel Corporation Intel has revealed a new virtual reality (VR) headset that promises to have all of the tech in one device with no wires or attachments, unlike its competitors. Despite Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive already hitting the market after years of development, Intel now feels it’s the time to make a move into the VR headset realm with its latest project, dubbed Project Alloy. In an attempt to distinguish it from its competitors, Intel took to the stage at its recent developers forum to say that the Project Alloy headset will be an all-in-one device. This means that all of the tech typically spread over a number of devices – such as the sensors, camera and human-input controls – will be located entirely within the headset. What this will mean for performance and capability remains to be seen as current VR headsets are tethered to a PC because it acts as the processing hub, allowing for a smoother experience with a higher frame rate. Based on what Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, had to say in a blog post about Project Alloy, it appears that it will not reach the capabilities of the highest end of gaming. Partnering with Microsoft “The most aggressive, high-end gamers who value the low latency of tethered systems will continue to enjoy those systems, and their systems will continue to advance and improve,” he said. “But for the rest of us, we now have the choice to experience our virtual worlds across larger spaces without pesky cords.” Powering the Project Alloy headset is Intel’s RealSense 1080p camera technology, which uses infrared and lasers to determine another person’s location in front of the user. It also means that your hands play a part in the VR space as opposed to using another handheld controller to interact with objects. Another bit of news to come from the event was that Intel is partnering with Microsoft to bring the latter’s Windows Holographic operating system to Project Alloy, allowing developers to create games on this platform. As for when we’re likely to see the first Project Alloy headset, Intel has said it will arrive sometime in the latter half of 2017.

The company unveiled Intel Project Alloy -- an all-in-one VR solution that features the compute and sensors integrated directly into the headset and leverages "Intel RealSense" technology. Intel is also collaborating with Microsoft to bring VR to mainstream PCs, the company said in a statement on wednesday. During the annual conference organised from August 16-18, CEO Brian Krzanich introduced the new Intel Joule platform for the IoT -- a high-end compute platform capable of delivering human-like senses to a new generation of smart devices. He also announced the availability of the Yuneec Typhoon H drone, Intel Aero Platform Compute Board and the Intel Aero Platform Ready-to-Fly Drone. Speaking about the importance of role developers are playing in bringing company's projects to life, the company also announced the Intel Euclid Developer Kit for researchers and robotics developers. The device integrates sense, compute and connect capabilities in an all-in-one candy bar size form-factor that gives developers the ability to quickly create applications with "Intel RealSense" technology. Krzanich also explained his vision for merged reality -- a new way of experiencing physical and virtual interactions and environments through a suite of next-generation sensing and digitising technologies. "Merged reality delivers virtual world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before -- and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible," said Krzanich. --IANS sku/na/vm Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Ratan Tata's ego caused financial mess for group firms: Cyrus Mistry Demonetisation: Problem of plenty for RBI as banks park record Rs 4.32 lakh crore Supreme Court refuses to stay petitions against demonetisation Demonetisation: Union Minister latest victim as hospital declines to accept old notes No transaction charges on debit card payments: Govt More From Current Affairs Marion Cotillard was only choice for 'Allied' Casting SRK is the demand of the role: Aanand L.

Krzanich also explained his vision of  merged reality, allowing for a new way of physical and virtual interactions with the environment. In a post written by Krzanich on Medium.com, he said that it’s a challenge to merge physical (real-life movements and environments) with virtual (simulated) objects. Virtual reality often requires a complex set of sensors, cameras, hand controllers and consoles. Merged reality will allow a user to pick a real world tennis racket and step onto a virtual tennis court, or experience a sporting or a concert from the point of view of your choice. According to Krzanich, “Merged reality delivers virtual world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before – and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible.” Intel also introduced its Project Alloy, an all-in-one virtual reality solution headset that will be offered as an open hardware platform in 2017. The company also announced a collaboration with Microsoft in order to bring virtual reality to PCs. Intel has introduced the Intel Joule, an IoT platform high-end computing device that is capable of delivering human-like senses to smart devices that are already available. Intel has also announced Intel Custom Foundry, its 10 nm design platform offering access to ARM Artisan physical IP. The company claims that this will enable foundry customers to achieve the best-in-class power, performance, area in consumer applications. The company has also announced the Yunee Typhoon H drone, a Compute Board with an flying drone; and the Intel Euclid Developer Kit for researchers and robotics developers. Google is also reportedly working on its own standalone mixed-reality headset, which was announced at Google I/O in May 2016. The company is putting renewed emphasis on developing its mobile VR platform in push for grander hardware. Google is reportedly working on a hardware project that does not require a mobile or a PC to run it.

When Intel unveiled its Project Alloy all-in-one virtual reality headset at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, it opened up an untethered future for virtual reality. That is a big jump in itself, but the possibilities this opens up are even bigger. Welcome to the world of mixed reality. After augmented reality and virtual reality, we now have a new front where the virtual and real will merge. In the words of Intel CEO Brian Krzanich it is “a new way of experiencing physical and virtual interactions and environments through a suite of next-generation sensing and digitizing technologies”. So it will be more “dynamic and natural than before”, Krzanich wrote in his blog, mentioning how you could now pick up a tennis racquet and play in Centre Court at Wimbledon or make a trip of the Sistine Chapel without leaving your desk. You can do that even now, at least to a certain extent. But what is revolutionary is that Intel’s mixed reality vision is devoid of the “cost — and creep factor” associated with fitting high-end sensors in the room where you want to experience VR. That is because this world of mixed reality that Intel is speaking about will leverage its RealSense camera technology. With no cords, users will get the six degrees of freedom with the ability to surge backward or forward, reach up or down, sway left or right. And Intel RealSense camera, which will be on the headset and other smart objects, will ensure you are not “you’re not colliding into real-world stuff”. And since you will not have to carry large HTC Vive-like rigs along, this should make VR more portable and feasible. Krzanich talks about more natural manipulation with no need for nunchucks or other controllers and users using just their real hands to work their way around this virtual world and its objects.

So technologies like Intel’s Replay 360-degree technologies will use “encoded video and advanced composition algorithms captured from an array of cameras to digitise whole playing fields and venues — from any position, from any point of view, and with an enhanced ability to interact”. This ability to walk through or manipulate real world content virtually will be the next big leap we see.

Based around Intel’s canceled-but-not-quite Broxton Atom processor, Joule is designed to further augment Intel’s existing lineup of kits by offering a much higher performance part based on the latest generations of the company’s technologies. Back in 2013 Intel announced Galileo, the first of what has become a collection of IoT kits/platforms for hardware developers. Galileo and its compatriots Edison and Curie turned out to be solid hits for the company – even with competing kits already on the market – driving a big part of Intel’s overall IoT growth in recent years. The System on Module boards proved popular with tinkers and product developers alike who needed small systems for everything from small prototypes to a commercial off the shelf boards. Intel IoT Kits   Joule 570X Joule 550X Edison SoC Intel Atom "Broxton-M" T5700 Intel Atom "Broxton-M" T5500 Intel Atom "Tangier" Z34xx CPU 4x Goldmont @ 1.7GHz, Turbo to 2.4GHz 4x Goldmont @ 1.5GHz 2x Silvermont @ 500MHz 1x Quark @ 100MHz GPU Intel Gen9 Intel Gen9 N/A RAM 4GB LPDDR4 3GB LPDDR4 1GB LPDDR3 Storage 16GB eMMC 8GB eMMC 4GB eMMC Wireless 802.11ac w/MIMO + BT 4.1 802.11n + BT 4.0 I/O UART + GPIO + I2C + MIPI CSI + MIPI DSI + USB 3.0 SD + UART + SPI + GPIO + USB 2.0 OTG Dimentions 48 x 24 x 5 mm 35.5 x 25 x 3.9 mm Joule then extends Intel’s presence in this market by offering a higher performing part in their IoT portfolio. Whereas the previous top-tier Edison board used a combination of Atom Silvermont and Quark CPU cores and paired this up with a respectable amount of RAM, NAND, and I/O options, Joule goes much further. The SoC at the heart of the board is Intel’s Broxton-M, which although was canceled for consumer devices, as we can now see will instead be making a home for itself within Intel’s IoT product family. Intel is offering two different versions of the Joule board. Both use the same SoC, but they vary in clockspeeds and memory. The more powerful of the two, Joule 570X, uses what Intel is calling a Atom T5700, which is a quad core Goldmont Atom configuration with a base clock of 1.7GHz and can turbo to 2.4GHz. This in turn is paired with 4GB of LPDDR4 memory and a 16GB eMMC NAND module for non-volatile storage. Meanwhile the Joule 550X drops the quad core Atom to 1.5GHz with no turbo, and features 3GB of LPDDR4 memory along with 8GB of NAND. Both Joule boards also feature the same I/O connectivity. On the wireless side, this is composed of a radio supporting Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac (MIMO is listed supported, so I’m wagering this is a 2 spatial stream solution). And on the wired side, USB 3.0 is supported, along with the vast collection of GPIOs, UARTs, and MIPI’s camera (CSI) and display (DSI) interfaces. The Joule module itself is said to only be a bit larger than the Edison module – which was usually measured relative to a postage stamp – and in the brief glimpse of the module we got when Brian Krzanich held it out on stage, I’d say we’re looking at something not too much bigger than a stick of gum (or perhaps the old Sony memory stick). Intel hasn’t released the full documentation for the kit yet, so we don’t have power consumption information available, but given the higher performance goals for the kit (and the quad Goldmont CPU cores), it’s a fair bet that it’s going to be higher than Edison. As you might expect from the specifications, Intel is aiming Joule at a higher performance class of use cases. Ultimately as a maker kit it’s a bit of an “if you build it” situation – it’s up to developers to figure out what to do with it – but Intel sees it as being useful for drones, AR/VR, robotics, and for the first time in one of their IoT products, computer vision. While we don’t have a ton of hard details on the underlying iGPU, it is powerful enough for certain CV tasks, and it supports both 4K video capture and display. It also supports Intel’s RealSense camera, giving developers the option of using the underlying depth sensing capabilities for improved vision/analysis. Finally, on the software side of matters, the Joule will support a few different OSes. The boards will default to a new Linux distribution specifically designed for the hardware that Intel is calling Reference Linux OS for IoT, and Cannonical’s “Snappy” Ubuntu Core is also supported. Meanwhile Microsoft’s Windows 10 IoT Core is also supported for developers who need Windows interoperability. Wrapping things up, along with today’s announcement, Intel has already begun selling one of the Joule SKUs, with the others to follow. The Joule 570X development kit, which includes the Joule module, carrier board, WiFi antennas, and other components is on sale today at IDF for $369, and will be available through Intel’s partners next month. At that price it’s fair to say that Intel is not aiming to have Joule compete with more mainstream kits – or even their own Edison kit – but rather at the more upscale kits such as the (even more expensive) NVIDIA Jetson TX1, which is a much tighter market in terms of the number of competitors. Meanwhile the lower-end 550X development kit and the stand-alone Joule modules are scheduled for release in Q4. Pricing for those products has not yet been disclosed, though given the intent for Joule to be used in mass production devices, it’ll be interesting to see what Intel prices the stand-alone modules at.

POST A COMMENT 60 Comments View All Comments ddriver - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link The module itself is too big to begin with, not to mention the dev board. Also, specs are overkill for IoT, it doesn't need such fast storage, it doesn't need the 4 gigs of ram, especially considering that most atom tablets are still crippled at the pathetic 2 gigs of ram in devices which could actually make use of it, it doesn't need the CPU power, it certainly doesn't need the windoze spy/adware, it especially doesn't need the power requirements for all this. And all this for "only" 369$? U crazy? Why does intel even bother? They can't do business without fat profit margins, they already failed to make any significant presence in the mobile device market, and IoT margins are even lower. Cortex M and R are really all IoT needs, and in some applications even smaller 8bit mcus make sense, they are tiny, easy to work with on the very low level and cost next to nothing. Who needs a lousy atom in IoT, that's an application processor, not a hardware device microelectronic. Reply smilingcrow - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link It's clearly a high end device with features, performance & price to match and aimed at a niche market. Way to miss the point yet again. Clueless troll. FO. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link A very niche market, I reckon one year in sale this product will own a whooping 0.0000001% of the IoT market, and of all the people who use it, 99% will be doing so because intel gave them the boards away for free advertising and paid to use them instead of something that actually makes sense. Your immediate resort to personal attacks really goes to show who the troll is, and also the fanboy. And your ignorance towards how poorly suited this "high end" lousy overprices atom is compared to dedicated, much more energy efficient and much cheaper solutions goes to show who the clueless is. And since I am not convinced in your powers of deduction either, I will just say it straight to make it easier - it is all you ;) By the time this hits market arm boards will be trashing it at 1/5 of the cost. Intel seems desperate to show it can do something other than milking their monopoly on x86, but as is evident from the market share they "conquered" in those other areas, they fail miserably at it, a failure further amplified by the tremendous amount of resources at their disposal failing to deliver. Seems like intel doesn't do too well in markets where it actually has competition, wish they had competition in x86 as well. Instead of creating designs to target specific markets, they try to cram their x86 cr@p in there cuz that's all they know and have, but with the prices and margins of ARM chips that sh1t ain't gonna fly. Reply smilingcrow - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Just got sick of the almost continuous stream of crap you post on here. They are selling it partly on seemingly exclusive features such as the RealSense camera. For some people x86 is a bonus depending on their skill set and tool-set. It's obviously not aimed for high volume at this price so to ignore its unique features over a much cheaper ARM product aimed for the mass market shows your ignorance. So either you are ignorant or trolling or probably both in your case. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Ddriver always shit-posts.

Oh wait, that's just another failure waiting to happen product of intel's misguided aspirations to be on the "forefront of innovation". Duh, it's two cameras and some software for gesture recognition, because you know, waving your hands around is so much better than traditional input techniques. I got only one gesture for realsense, and nobody on the planet needs software to recognize it :D Hopefully one day you will realize this behind this hype is yet another tool for producing, entertaining, milking and controlling sheeple. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link I honestly don't care about anything IoT or even developer kits like Raspberry Pi's, etc. so at this point you're shoving words in my mouth, as if I intimately cared about the technology presented in the article. I don't; I just read the article, scrolled through the comments section, found another person that had an agreeable post and posted a reply in agreement. I think you're just triggered because I called you out (along with another poster) that you frequently shit-post in Anandtech comment section. There's nothing else to say here, and saying anything further on the matter would essentially be feeding the troll. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link So you enter a "discussion" in an article with a topic you are ignorant of and don't care about to whine about someone else's opinion on the subject? All you wanted was to agree with someone. So quaint. It seems like you are in need of approval, thus provide approval for the sake of getting back some in return. This indicates underlying psychological problems, you may want to consult with a shrink, this is not an insult but a helpful advice. It is not a matter of thinking with you, but a matter of believing, that I "triggered" because you "called me out" but there isn't anything to indicate that's the case. You went whining because I have actual knowledge on the subject and standards that I dictate and not the industry, and you did it while having absolutely nothing to back it up - way to go. Thus you resort to the "that's all, if you reply you are a troll, if you don't - I showed you" cliche - so "by the book" wannabe. If you have like a few brain cells working, you would seriously think over what I just said, because chances are this is the best thing anyone is ever going to do for you. If you consider others substantiated opinions "shit" just because they don't agree with your unsubstantiated somewhat-of-an-opinion you are in dire need of professional help. If you have a problem with criticism towards a long time monopolist who has done irreparable damage to progress and innovation for the sake of profit and still struggles to stay relevant by cramming his stuff "everywhere" it doesn't belong - then that's an indication of a deep and serious underlying problem. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link Hey, just FYI, but you should probably take a look in the mirror, because not once in your incoherent ramble did anything you say make any sense, nor did anything of it hold any truth, at all, whatsoever. Your post is a pretty key example of online projecting; You're projecting your own character flaws onto someone else whom just made a post to say they agree with another poster. You kind of need to learn to "deal with" online posts. Reply Images - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link Are there going to be any alternatives to it in a bigger variant?

LG has recently decided to collaborate with Intel of the US, a rival to Samsung Electronics and Qualcomm in the semiconductors sector, in producing its own chips. At the Intel Developer Forum 2016, an annual semiconductor conference, in San Francisco, Intel and the Korean tech giant announced the US chip powerhouse will churn out chips for LG at its fabrication facilities utilizing 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology.  LG Electronics’ Nuclun mobile application processor. LG Elecronics The chip will reportedly be a 64-bit mobile system-on-chip, which is anticipated to power LG’s flagship smartphone, anticipated to roll out next year. The Korean firm said, however, no details of the collaborative work have been decided yet. “The schedule for the mass production of the chip has not been set yet, nor which smartphone model will sport the chip,” a LG Electronics official said. LG once utilized its own mobile processor Nuclun to power its G3 Screen smartphone, released in 2014, but the firm has not rolled out chips emblazoned with its brand on them since then. For the production of Nuclun, LG worked with TSMC of Taiwan. Instead of powering its smartphones with its own chips, LG has been deploying Qualcomm’s mobile chips so far. Therefore, LG’s latest move to make use of its own mobile chips to be developed by Intel will likely deal a blow to Qualcomm. Qualcomm’s mobile chip business has been struggling in recent years as Samsung, one of its biggest customers, has increasingly been adopting its own chip, Exynos, for Samsung smartphones. The sales slowdown of Apple’s iPhones, which are fitted with Qualcomm chips, also undermined the bottom line of the San Diego-based chip company in recent years.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version August 17, 2016 - 11:56 AMT SHARE Intel building virtual reality studio in Los Angeles Intel has dropped another virtual reality revelation at this year's developer conference besides its new Project Alloy all-in-one headset. Apparently, it's also building a new studio in Los Angeles, which company chief Brian Krzanich called the "Intel Tech Experience Labs," specifically for sports and entertainment virtual reality projects, Engadget said. While the company hasn't released more details about the studio yet, LA Times said it will focus on helping companies and other third parties create VR videos using Intel's technology. VentureBeat also said that the studio will build upon the 360-degree replay tech Intel purchased earlier this year that the NBA used to show different angles of the court. By building a VR studio, Intel is following in the footsteps of other companies that already made the investment. Facebook's Oculus has the Story Studio, pretty much the Pixar of virtual reality, that churns out short films. YouTube's LA and NYC offices are already equipped with their own VR rigs, and even Engadget's parent company AOL snapped up a VR studio for 360-degree HuffPo videos. SHARE PanARMENIAN.Net © 2000—2016

By: Tech Desk | Updated: August 17, 2016 1:49 pm Intel’s Project Alloy headset, which was unveiled at Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco. Intel Project Alloy, a new all-in-one virtual reality solution with the company’s RealSense Technology has been unveiled at the ongoing Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled Project Alloy, and the company will offer this as an open platform in 2017. In case of Project Alloy, the computing device and sensors are directly integrated into the VR headset. The company claims a user can go totally wireless on Alloy; it does not need to a computer or other sensors for the user to experience ‘merged reality’. In case of Alloy, the computing power is “located in the Alloy Head-Mounted Device (HMD),” says a statement from the company. According to Intel, this will ensure “free range of motion with 6 degrees-of-freedom across a large space.” The headset can also detect collision, and ensures a better virtual experience for the user. Intel’s focus with Project Alloy is on merged reality, and the headset will let a user see elements from the real world, but also interact with the virtual world via the Intel RealSense technology. To explain it better, the virtual stream will merge with the real world, and a user can interact with both inside the headset, unlike traditional VR headsets where a user can only experience the virtual world. Intel’s Alloy is not dependent on any external sensors, and has Intel RealSense cameras attached to the headset. Intel says the platform is available to developers, inventors and other companies to make their own headsets using RealSense. Intel has also revealed it is working with Microsoft to optimise Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy. The company will open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem, allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products.

According to his post on Medium, “Merged reality delivers virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before,” something that has not been possible till now. A merged reality experience as Intel is pitching it will let users experience the virtual world without relying on too many sensors or wires to set up the headset. The post further explains, “Merged reality goes beyond computer-generated content. It’s about bringing the real physical world into the digital world real time — and reimagining it with computing power.” Based on Intel’s announcement, it looks the company wants to eliminate the boundaries between the digital and the real world. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

By Alistair Charlton August 17, 2016 09:18 BST Project Alloy blends virtual reality with the real world to create 'merged reality'Intel Intel has announced a mixed-reality headset, which combines a point-of-view camera with virtual reality. Called Project Alloy and revealed by CEO Brian Krzanich, the headset will be available in 2017 and could become a rival to the Microsoft Hololens, another mixed-reality system. Here is everything you need to know about Intel Project Alloy, the latest player in the growing virtual reality industry. 1. It will launch in 2017 Although it was demonstrated on stage on 16 August, Intel says Project Alloy will not be available to people outside of the company until 2017. Although several rivals are already on sale, 2017 is set to be a major year for VR development and growth from the nascent market. 2. Project Alloy will be offered as an open platform This means developers will be given the freedom to do what they want with Project Alloy. They will be less tied down than on other platforms, with Intel pledging to open the hardware and provide open APIs as part of an entire ecosystem. This will allow developers and partners to create their own branded products based on the Alloy's basic design. 3. There are no cables A major sticking point with VR headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift is their cables. Being plugged into a computer means exploring a VR world can feel restrictive. Intel says Project Alloy will be untethered, meaning no cables. Intel says Project Alloy will be launched as an open platform in 2017Intel 4. Freedom with collision avoidance The Project Alloy offers users six directions of movement, similar to the HTC Vive. Intel says the system works across a "large space" but doesn't say exactly how much the wearer can walk around in VR. Unlike the Vive, which relies on two sensors positioned across the room to help it know where it is, Project Alloy carries all of its sensors onboard. 5. Merged reality and Intel RealSense Instead of virtual reality, Project Alloy uses merged reality. Also used by the Microsoft HoloLens and mysterious Magic Leap, this is where a virtual reality image is laid over what the wearer can actually see. As Intel explains: "Through merged reality, see your hands, see your friends...see the wall you are about to run into. Using Intel RealSense technology, not only can you see these elements from the real world, but you can use your hands to interact with elements of your virtual world, merging realities." 6. Less product, more platform Project Alloy is not a finished product to be sold to consumers, like the HTC Vive. Instead, this is an entirely new mixed-reality platform created by Intel. Developers and even other hardware manufacturers will be able to produce their own Project Alloy-based products and software. 7. A partnership with Microsoft Intel is also collaborating with Microsoft to "optimise Windows-based content and experience on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy."

Microsoft is making the HoloLens. Google pioneered cheap virtual reality headsets with Cardboard and will soon release an Android-powered VR platform called Project Daydream. Facebook owns Oculus, the makers of the Rift. HTC and Steam partnered to release the Vive. Sony is releasing PlayStation VR for its PS4 game system on October 13. Razer has already released the OSVR HDK 2, and AMD is collaborating on an Oculus Rift rival of its own with a company called Sulon Technologies. Heck, even 170-year-old lens maker Carl Zeiss is getting in on the action. My point here, obviously, is that the virtual and augmented reality headset market is a crowded space. But that competition didn't stop Intel, world-leading producer of CPUs, from jumping headfirst into the fray with its brand-new platform, Project Alloy. The headset was announced by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the Intel Developer Forum held in San Francisco and while there's some very obvious comparisons to the half-dozen other headsets on the market already, Project Alloy has some very key differences: it's completely tetherless, doesn't need any external sensors and it will be powered by a 6th Gen Intel Core processor. Krzanich called it a merged reality headset – a headset that can switch in-between augmented reality and virtual reality putting you into a virtual environment surrounded by real, physical items. Krzanich joked that with merged reality you could experience all the joys virtual reality had to offer without the pain that true, all-immersive VR brings – e.g. no more bumping into walls, putting your hand through the TV and falling off the stage during a presentation because you couldn't see what's in front of you. Taken at face value, Alloy looks like it's a smart take on a crowded genre, but when will it come out and what, exactly, can you expect to use it for? Krzanich had few staunch details to share. We know that Intel is aiming for the second half of 2017 for a release date, and that it'd like to get units into developer's hands by December of this year, but there's been no word on how much it'd cost or what developers have already signed on board. Then there's also the elephant in the room to consider – Microsoft's own AR/VR platform, HoloLens, that in many ways looks significantly better than Project Alloy despite being announced over a year ago that could kill Intel's latest tech before it ever takes off. While we may not know everything about it just yet, here's what we know about Intel's vision for merged reality so far. Design Project Alloy, aesthetically speaking, seems like a cross between Sony's PlayStation VR and Samsung's Gear VR – it's mostly covered in pristine white plastic minus the back headband that packs a battery and tightening screw. It's an easy comparison to draw to the Gear VR – not only are the colors the same, but there looks like there's a lightness about the headset … not that Intel is letting anyone try one on this early in the game. But while it might look more like a fusion of Samsung and Sony's wearables, it will function – primarily – more like Microsoft's HoloLens. Take a look at the front face of the device. You'll notice three sets of cameras. One of these is an infrared sensor that will be able to tell whether something is hot and cold (perfect for knowing whether there's a person or just a person-shaped piece of cardboard in front of you). The other set is a pair of fisheye lenses that will be able to see to the sides of your peripheral vision. And the final set is a pair of specially made Intel RealSense sensors that will be able to track depth and distance. If you've come to be an expert in the field of virtual reality over the course of the last few months since the Rift's launch, you might notice that Project Alloy doesn't have any tracking dots or divots. That's because the headset has enough data to know exactly where it is and what orientation it's in – or at least that's what Intel says. The other noticeable difference – well, besides the lack of a wire running to a PC – is that Project Alloy doesn't use any sort of controller. Now, that doesn't mean you won't be able to select options once you're inside the semi-virtual world. On the right side are two buttons, C1 and C2, which will likely act like the A and B buttons on a controller. So how, exactly, does it perform? It works well … sort of. Saying that Project Alloy works well in its current state requires a bit of qualification. First off, there's almost no one – except Krzanich himself – who can say what it's like to use Project Alloy. Intel is keeping most of the details on it, as well as development kits themselves, close to its chest at the moment. That said, as a virtual reality helmet everything looks fine. Even without the massive processing power of GPU to run the show, Alloy seemed to create a convincing reality while Krzanich was on stage. In the live feed shown to the audience there was almost no detectable tearing or troubling low polygon count. It looked close – if not identical – to the Oculus Rift. Well it did until Krzanich came too close to the headset. Then all hell broke loose. Because it's an merged reality headset, Alloy pulls in objects from the real world. This would be neat if the camera could recognize an object – like, say, your hands – and created a one-to-one digital representation of them in your virtual space. It can't. What Alloy can do is pull in the live feed of your hands from the real world and put them into your virtual world, graininess and all. The final product looked as frightening and as experience-breaking as you'd expect. Now, that might change once more developers get their hands on it – Intel is partnering up with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy – but that's no guarantee that augmented reality products will ever look natural in virtual reality. What's your takeaway? Intel isn't afraid to break new ground. It's crushed processor sales for years, and is now looking for new ways to partner with content creators. Project Alloy, like Intel Joule and any of the RealSense camera technology, is just one more way for Intel to get its products into the world and into the next-generation of heavily commoditized products. And while it might feel to some like another entry in a crowded genre rather than something completely and utterly jaw-dropping, Project Alloy has potential. When Microsoft and Intel work together, the two usually achieve more than either could on its own. If the two can sit down and develop a set of standards for all Windows-based headsets to follow, content developers will surely jump on board. If it can't, well, there's a small chance that Alloy might become vaporware by this time next year. Related news Here's when and where you can buy the Samsung Gear S3 Almost over!

The wire-free VR headset explained Mike Lowe17 August 2016VR Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Virtual reality is a big deal, but delving into the virtual world typically requires a tethered-to-PC solution. That's where Intel Project Alloy does things differently: this all-in-one VR headset is designed without wires, with all its computational power and batteries tucked away inside. Is it set to be the ultimate VR headset? Intel Project Alloy: No tether required The premier VR headsets available today, such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, require a hardwire tether to associated PC, which can get in the way of the experience. Project Alloy has no wires to tether to any external sources (unless you want a video out to a separate screen), instead putting the computational power and batteries inside the device. That makes it more like the Samsung Gear VR, but with greater computational power potential. However, there are questions over this kind of design as it will surely be heavier than the competition, bringing its comfort into question. And what of heat dissipation? We'll have to wait and see if Intel has cleverly designed the headset to avoid these issues, as graphics cards and high-end CPUs require some kind of cooling. Intel Project Alloy: Multi-room tracking The main point of difference that Project Alloy offers compared to its competition is the integration of Intel RealSense cameras. This means the headset doesn't require any additional sensors placed around the room to detect its surroundings, unlike HTC Vive's arrangement of dedicated sensors. This means Project Alloy offers what Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, describes as "multi-room tracking", i.e. the ability to use it throughout any given space, not just a dedicated pre-scanned area. The RealSense cameras can not only detect surrounding objects' distance from the headset, they can also bring digital visualisations of them into the virtual space. So if you're about to walk into your kitchen table, it'll pop-up into your field of view. However, RealSense's depth perception isn't foolproof just yet and the way these objects appear in view look like rough Photoshop cutouts rather than smoothly integrated virtual elements. Intel Project Alloy: No physical controllers required The ability for RealSense to visualise surrounding objects and bring them into Project Alloy's virtual environment does bring another interesting prospect, though: you can use your hands as controllers, with each digit tracked and able to move through six degrees of mobility. Your actual hands can appear, digitally rendered, in the virtual world for reference. So there's no more clicking a controller button to, say, hold onto an object in virtual space - simply clasp your actual hand to hold onto virtual objects. Clever stuff - but it needs some tweaks, as the slightly fussy demonstration on stage at the 2016 Intel Developer Conference (IDF) made apparent when a push switch needed to be fisted into motion rather than accurately handled. Intel Project Alloy: What is 'Merged Reality'? That real objects can be digitally rendered into the virtual world in real-time does bring another interesting ability to Project Alloy: merged reality, or mixed reality. Pick up a physical object and, if it's close enough to the headset's RealSense cameras, it will also be digitally rendered into the virtual world. Almost like a reverse-engineered augmented reality, if you will. As this process is refined it could mean more intricate input, with real-world objects directly correlating to the virtual world. Grab a paintbrush and make a detailed painting, say. For the sake of the demo at IDF, Intel used a one dollar bill, its corner used to lathe a virtual cylinder of gold into a new virtual object. Obscure demo, we know, but there's wider scope for, say, puzzle games that require specific crafting in order to progress. Intel Project Alloy: When will it be available and how much will it cost? Project Alloy will be available to Intel partners from the second half of 2017. That likely means we won't see a real-world consumer product until 2018 or even later. Price is off the cards at this stage in time. It will be largely dependent on the compute power integrated in the product, we suspect. Whether it's a one-size-fits-all specification is not yet known.

Krzanich said he’s going to make the Alloy design open source and offer it for developers to use. Separately, Microsoft Corp. is going to update its Windows 10 software with Windows Holographic capabilities to help move VR more into the mainstream, according to Microsoft Executive Vice President Terry Myerson, who spoke at the Intel conference. Krzanich is trying to get his company’s products into new markets to make up for the personal computer industry’s slump. Intel still gets the majority of its revenue from that market, which is on course to end this year 100 million units smaller than its peak in 2011. It’s also been missing targets in the lucrative server chip business, which had been propping up the chipmaker’s earnings. Like many other chip company chief executives, Krzanich said he’s focusing on the growing market for adding computing to everyday devices, called the Internet of Things. Though that unit has grown, it still only accounts for about 4 per cent of the company’s total sales. Krzanich showed off new chips and computer boards and sensors aimed at firing up that business. One will provide the computing and communications guts of drones, making it easier for designers of autonomous versions of the small aircraft to quickly build consumer and industrial products. For those that don’t want to do the building themselves, Intel will offer a complete drone kit. The Intel CEO also spoke with an executive from BMW AG, about the need for increasing computing within cars as they progress toward full autonomy. The German automaker has partnered with Intel to try to develop industry-standard parts that will speed up progress toward that goal. BMW Senior Vice President Elmar Frickenstein told the audience at the conference that his company is aiming to offer fully, autonomous vehicles by 2021. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week How Apple lost China to two unknown local smartphone makers Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Facebook reportedly built a censorship tool for China (VIDEO) Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Twitter boss briefly suspended from his own network Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Three Star Wars drones to land before Christmas (VIDEO) Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Zuckerberg says he’ll take steps to solve Facebook fake news Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Soar above the planet’s most spectacular sights with Google Earth VR (VIDEO) Google could have a new VR headset in store for October 2016 Intel to spin off cybersecurity unit McAfee McAfee antivirus pioneer fights Intel over who owns his name A VR headset that’s heavy on style Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The wireless Project Valley VR headset is standalone and does not need to be attached to a computer. The computing power is located in the Alloy Head-Mounted Device (HMD), which allows the user to experience VR untethered. The headset uses Intel’s RealSense technology which essentially are cameras that can measure relative depth and position, and even orientation. These cameras and sensors that are attached to the headset allows a user to introduce objects from the real world. The VR headset offers “room-to-room” tracking and lets you move around the environment. Additionally, Intel is collaborating with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy. Intel said it will open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem, allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products from the Alloy design, in 2017.

Joining the likes of Microsoft, Sony and (possibly) Apple, Intel is currently developing a headset that uses its own RealSense depth-sensing cameras, Replay graphics-creation software and other Intel intellectual property. Revealed at its Intel’s developer conference today, the ‘merged reality’ device — dubbed ‘Project Alloy’ — has a key advantage over other headsets in that it allows users to see their own hands, and use them to interact with objects in the game. Using the headset’s RealSense cameras, the headset could detect a user’s finger movement and allow users to manipulate objects within a simulation — thus negating the need for controllers. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat According to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich: Merged reality is about more natural ways of interacting with and manipulating virtual environments — by liberating you from the controllers and the nun chucks of today’s VR systems by immersing your hands — your real-life hands — into your simulated experiences thanks to readily available new sensing technologies. It’s also completely cordless, for better or worse. While it’s nice to avoid being jolted out of a realistic simulation once you run out of cord, the reliance on WiFi will slow the computer’s response time ever-so-slightly — which could be just enough to ruin the experience. The demonstration itself was less-than-impressive, at least according to sources in attendance. The merged reality objects only appeared as low resolution graphics and the hand-tracking Krzanich touted only works if you keep your hands near the center of a user’s field of view. Of course, this isn’t anywhere near a finished product. For now, it’s just Intel formally throwing its hat into an ever-growing ring of virtual and augmented reality players. In the mean time though, Intel can be confident that it further muddied the augmented reality waters by adding yet another brand-specific distinction — merged reality for a general public that may not know the difference between augmented and virtual reality. Now, they’ve got virtual, augmented, merged, and mixed (Microsoft) reality. You know, in case they weren’t confused enough already. Intel intends to offer the technology that drives Project Alloy to other manufacturers next year. There are no plans for a consumer release of the Intel-branded headset.

Bloomberg reported that Intel has licensed the right to make ARM processors, which is an interesting development for both Apple and Intel. Intel Intel benefits from taking an ARM license in many different ways. The first is that ARM is eating Intel’s lunch in the mobile space. Sure, Intel would prefer that Intel processors were driving the move to mobile, but having failed to make that happen, making ARM processors for others is substantially better than not being involved at all. Related, an ARM license will allow Intel to optimize its best-in-class fabrication facilities. Chip fabrication facilities can cost billions, and an idle fab is a fab not making money. To this end, Intel announced this week a deal with LG to make some of the Korean company’s processors. Apple The case for Apple is very different, but it starts with Samsung. Apple and Samsung are bitter rivals and close manufacturing partners, too. Samsung has long made most of Apple’s Ax processors, and Samsung built a fab in Manor, TX (outside Austin) for this very purpose. Samsung earned that business by being one of the best at making ARM processors, but who among us thinks Apple wouldn’t be pleased as punch to send that business to someone else? Apple has given some foundry business to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), but Samsung is still a major partner in Apple’s chip business. Another aspect is the price Apple pays for its chips. One of the company’s specialties is pitting component makers against each other to get the best quality at the lowest price. While TSMC has only been able to earn some of Apple’s foundry business, Intel could conceivably earn it all. Intel has the resources, engineering brilliance, facilities, and skill to become a heavy weight in ARM fabrication. A major new competitor in the foundry space means Apple can extract that much more value out of its contracts. All in all, it’s a good move for Intel and good news for Apple.

Their first foray was in the early 2000s with the Intel® PXA26x Processor Family. It was cool at the time, but Intel sold that part off. I guess they thought their Atom processor was better. August 17, 2016 at 2:08 EST AM JustCause August 17, 2016 If you can’t beat the market right now, join the market until you find a way to beat it. Bridging the economic gap until a solution is found is a smart approach. And for Apple it’s huge, leveraging three vendors against each other is always better, if they could only find a fourth and fifth (maybe Foxconn will jump in ) August 17, 2016 at 3:32 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that the headset is capable of "merged reality" which blends elements of the real-world, into the virtual one. During the Intel Developer Forum, the company demonstrated someone wearing a Project Alloy headset user who was holding a dollar bill in his physical hand, where he was shaving down a virtual block of gold in the VR world.   Krzanich said: "We believe the capability of Alloy and what it introduces is significant. It gives the opportunity to merge the physical and virtual world together". The company says that a merged reality headset should solve some of the issues about VR blocking out the real-world, where you can't see anything happening around you when the VR headset is on. Intel's new Project Alloy headset doesn't have any of the advanced and precise tracking technology that HTC and Valve designed with Lighthouse for the HTC Vive system, so we're looking towards an improved GearVR, with higher-end technology inside.   Intel has plans to make Project Alloy completely open source next year, as well as its RealSense technology API so that third-party manufactuers can work on their own headsets that are powered by Windows 10 and can use Intel's technology. Krzanich continued explaining: "Anybody can take the Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class virtual reality system with any manufacturer they choose".

Since it is independent from a connection to a computer or smartphone, Project Alloy is completely wireless. It comes built-in with its own processor and battery, according to Engadget. Intel is trying to achieve what it calls “merged reality,” the combination of virtual and augmented reality technology. That’s why Project Alloy comes with a camera that will let users see real objects and people around them while wearing it. The built-in camera is also able to track the user’s fingers so that they will be able to interact with virtual objects. Intel has not provided a release date for Project Alloy as it is still in very early development. However, Intel’s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, did demonstrate the capabilities of the headset live onstage during the company’s Developers Forum in San Francisco, California. Related Stories Virtual Reality Heads To Space New 'Batman: Arkham VR' Trailer Released Unlike the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift, Krzanich was able to use Project Alloy wirelessly. This gave him the freedom to move around the stage without any constrictions. The demo was described as “a bit finicky” by TechCrunch. Project Alloy heavily relies on Intel’s RealSense technology, the software that allows the built-in 1080p camera and infrared sensors to track the user’s movements/hands as well as the real world. “Through merged reality, see your hands, see your friends… see the wall you are about to run into. Using Intel RealSense technology, not only can you see these elements from the real world, but you can use your hands to interact with elements of your virtual world, merging realities,” Intel said. This is the same thing that Microsoft is trying to accomplish with the HoloLens. Speaking of the HoloLens, Intel’s Project Alloy can be used with Microsoft’s Holographic software, the same technology used for the HoloLens that will work on all Windows 10 PCs. To make Project Alloy even more accessible to developers and other manufacturers, Intel will make the hardware specifications of the headset and APIs open source in 2017.

Brad Evans reveals overlooked names for Week 12 What's on the Menu at Intel's (INTC) 2016 Developer Forum? Afrasiab Mian ZacksAugust 16, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share Tuesday saw the kickoff of the annual Intel INTC Developer Forum in San Francisco, CA. The event is an occasion for the company to dazzle consumers and 6,000 developers alike with its new products and strategic plans. Although Intel has seen difficulty in the chip market due to the major shift in consumer preference toward mobile devices, the company has plenty of new initiatives. One such market that Intel hopes to remain an integral part of is the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT), which our team has discussed here. IoT refers to everyday items that are connected to a network and can communicate with each other in order to streamline various activities for consumers. This new market has seen the meteoric rise of cloud computing, with recent IPOs Twilio Inc. TWLO and Acacia Communications ACIA stocks soaring recently. Let’s take a look at what Intel has planned in order to maintain its foothold as a go-to tech company in the years to come. Virtual Reality Intel CEO Brian Krzanich spent a solid chunk of time on day one of the conference discussing Project Alloy, the company’s virtual reality (VR) headset, which does not need a PC to function. Intel plans on making the design for the headset public by the second half of next year, and is working with Microsoft MSFT to bring holographic capacity to all Windows 10 PCs within the same timeframe. Intel already has a major role in VR headsets that work with PCs. The company’s chips are used in Facebook’s FB Oculus Rift and Microsoft’s HoloLens. As we have noted, the VR market is still quite new and has a massive amount of potential. Intel wants to bring itself to the forefront of this technological revolution, and Project Alloy could be its first-class ticket there. Artificial Intelligence Another major technological development from the turn of the 21st century is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The world of AI is still uncharted, and has not only technological but ethical implications as well. In Intel’s case, we got a taste of AI through the RealSense camera, which is what powers Project Alloy as well as the company’s obstacle-avoiding drones. Intel is also offering Project Aero, a platform for consumers to create their own drones. By processing thousands of hours of visual data, these drones can be programmed to automatically fly around various obstacles. The general mechanism behind AI is encapsulated in the way the drone operates. Essentially, machines can parse massive troves of data in order to learn and adapt to performing various tasks. Apple’s AAPL Siri and other personal assistants are an example of AI, with unmanned robot arms in car factories serving as another application of the concept. Intel calls the RealSense camera “Visual Intelligence,” which will also be used in its other major undertaking: autonomous vehicles. Self-Driving Cars Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Elon Musk’s Tesla TSLA are key players in the push for self-driving cars, but that market is becoming more crowded with time. In late-June, Intel formed a partnership with driverless technology company Mobileye MBLY and BMW BAMXF to develop its own take on the self-driving car. The idea is that the camera will allow vehicles to avoid obstacles the same way the drones can, increasing driver safety and taking another step towards bringing the concept into the market. For more on the self-driving car market, check our team’s guide on the industry. Bottom Line Intel was once the leader of all things technology. It has since descended from that throne, but is slowly working its way towards regaining lost ground. There are more days ahead in the Developer Forum, so it will be interesting to see if and what other information is revealed. Intel currently sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) due to numerous upward earnings estimate revisions for the foreseeable future. Current quarter estimates stand at $0.66 compared to the $0.64 estimate of 60 days ago, while full-year estimates are up eight cents to $2.51 per share. Investors should keep an eye on how this storied company tries in its own way to bring the consumer into the world of tomorrow. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Intel emits Linux-powered x86 brains for DIY flying gizmos Plus other developer kits: Joule and Euclid DIY drone brains ... The Linux-powered Aero single-board computer 17 Aug 2016 at 00:14, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles How a chunk of the web disappeared this week: GlobalSign's global HTTPS snafu explained Google: We look forward to running non-Intel processors in our cloud Intel: New x86 AI instructions IDF16 Intel has a bunch of new and updated hardware kits for engineers to toy with and use to build prototypes – from a DIY drone kit to a bunch of beefy Internet of Things packages. The most interesting is the Aero drone-building kit, available now to order. You use this single-board computer as the control electronics in a quadcopter: it does everything from the decision-making logic and processing of incoming remote control signals to driving the IO lines to the drone's propellers. It's basically a flying netbook: it has a quad-core 1.6GHz Atom x7-Z8700 processor that can ramp up its clock to 2.4GHz when needed. It has 2MB of cache, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of flash, built-in Wi-Fi, a microSD slot, and an M.2 connector for a PCIe SSD. It also has an on-board Altera Max 10 FPGA that drives an 80-pin IO connector, which carries: two I2C interfaces, a UART serial interface, SPI, CAN connectivity, five analog inputs, and 25 programmable GPIOs. There's also a USB3 OTG connector, and a micro HDMI port driven by the processor's builtin HD Graphics chipset. The FPGA is user-programmable; you can configure it as you wish to send signals to the motor controllers on each propeller, and to send and receive signals from onboard sensors and peripherals. The board also sports a MIPI CSI-2 camera interface and a USB3 connector to an Intel RealSense motion-detector cam, if fitted. Drone kit ... A complete Aero 'copter – the board is in the white box in the middle The Aero runs Yocto GNU/Linux. The idea is, you come up with a project – like a smog-detecting drone or a delivery-dropping quadcopter – and then take an Aero board, wire the necessary peripherals and sensors to it, and then attach it all to a drone skeleton. All you need is a frame with motors, propellers and motor controllers; the Altera FPGA on the board sends the necessary signals to the controllers and other gizmos. The board is the size of a playing card: 88mm by 63mm by 20mm, including the heatsink. Yes, it needs a heatsink. When we chatted to Intel staff about the kit, we were told the battery life numbers hadn't been finalized yet – how long one of these can fly between charges depends on the size of the battery and the weight of the drone. The board weighs 60g with a heatsink. Its 64-bit x86 Atom processor has a typical power draw of 2W. Right now, you can order one of these for just shy of 400 bucks, and a full kit including the drone frame will be available in the final quarter of 2016. That ready-to-fly build comes with libraries to access the RealSense camera and control the gizmo's flight, and an AirMap development kit so you don't knowingly fly into restricted airspace. In other Intel development kit news Intel has a new Internet of Things development kit called Joule [datasheet PDF] and it comes in two flavors: the 550x and the 570x. Both are pretty beefy by IoT standards. The 570x sports a 64-bit 1.7GHz quad-core Atom T5700 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of flash, HD Graphics, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, a camera interface, I2C and UART serial ports, and various GPIO pins. It runs Linux and supports RealSense motion-detecting cameras. The 550x is slightly less powerful, with a 1.5GHz Atom, and has 3GB of RAM and 8GB of flash. There are code samples here. The Joules will go on general sale through resellers in September. The Euclid kit has a RealSense camera, an Atom processor and wireless connectivity. It's about the size of a candy bar, and is aimed at academics, hardware tinkerers and robot builders. Finally, there's three new RealSense camera packages: a Robotic Development Kit, the high-precision ZR300 Development Kit, and the Camera 400 Series, which are optimized to capture as many points on a 3D object as possible per second. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 11 Comments More from The Register Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

In an interesting twist, their new Project Alloy headset was demonstrated on stage and marketed as a fully untethered VR device that uses dual RealSense cameras to monitor location and position of objects around the user. The headset stills needs a PC for data transmission, such as the Skull Canyon NUC with Iris Pro graphics, but the idea to have a headset without wires is interesting but offers up a number of questions. On top of this, the Real Sense cameras will have full five-finger recognition, allowing the software to adjust the appearance of the users hands or other figures as appropriate (this is where the Augmented Reality comes in). Intel mentioned that the headset has good weight distribution, as well as an SoC inside for the processing. There was no indication as to the power consumption of that SoC, but I can imagine it being under 10W otherwise it would heat up the users face over time. The back of the headset also has a compartment, which I would assume is battery, which gives another question on the battery life of such a headset. The VR + AR concept is being marketed as ‘mixed reality’ – the ability to use your hands in a VR environment which also adjusts the visuals of your hands based on what is happening in the scene. In the demo on stage, Intel showed a hand turning into a skeleton hand when placed in front of an X-Ray scanner in the scene. There was also discussion that this sort of mixed reality (MR) allows full roaming capabilities that mean a user won’t easily bump into objects around their home (or walls). The demo was also projected onto a large screen, and it was clear this is still a prototype as we could see dropped frames. It was mentioned that Holo-Lens used Cherry Trail, and this is more powerful. Another element of use was a mix of 2D/3D environments, such as the eponymous ‘unlimited desktop’ for working and consuming content. The use of RealSense will be similar to at least one other headset with an external camera, but the rendered video on screen showed a person manipulating 2D interfaces projected onto walls with a remote control. Project Alloy will require a Windows PC with Windows Holographic Platform, which will come to Windows 10 PCs next year as part of the regular updates. V1 of the device will be available to partners in December, and the hardware will be open sourced in the second half of 2017. The RealSense APIs will be opened up as well. Chances are we will see more demos this time next year.   Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Here's how USB Type-C could kill your headphone jack. Here's how Intel says there are good reasons to say goodbye to the 3.5mm audio jack and bring headphones, earbuds and microphones into the digital era. USB Type-C could kill your headphone jack. Here's how 0 Audio by Stephen Shankland August 16, 2016 5:01 PM PDT @stshank Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Enlarge Image The Intel Developer Forum takes place in San Francisco. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET One venerable computing technology, USB, could be about to help kill off an even older standard, the 3.5mm audio jack. The 3.5mm audio jack was popularized as the way to plug headphones into Sony's portable Walkman tape player and got a new lease on life as a way to handle audio on virtually every mobile phone and PC. But if Intel and its allies get their way, the new USB Type-C connector that's spread to some high-end PCs and phones will replace it in coming years. One big problem with removing the 3.5mm jack is that countless sets of earbuds and headphones suddenly become useless unless you buy an easily misplaced adapter. Another is that it's harder to charge a phone if you have headphones plugged into its sole port. But at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail sketched out a coming USB audio standard that could help push the 3.5mm jack aside. The new specification, due this quarter, adds features to ensure a USB headphone doesn't drain too much battery power and defines how buttons for pausing music or lowering volume work. The work "will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio," Saunders said. Technology standards arrive all the time, but the 3.5mm audio jack is a surprisingly contentious issue. Rumors that the upcoming iPhone 7 won't have one have worked the tech industry into a lather -- with some people hoping the jack will stay and others more sanguine about its possible departure. Why you might be happy to lose the 3.5mm jack But there are good arguments to be made for embracing USB audio, Saunders said, and the companies that make USB controller chips are very excited about the idea. Enlarge Image Intel has high hopes for USB's future. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET For one thing, the 3.5mm audio jack takes up precious volume inside phones, which we all want to be as slim as possible. For another, the analog circuitry of 3.5mm audio can cause interference that disrupts other electronics in a phone, Saunders said. And digital audio opens up possibilities for lots of sound-processing options without requiring expensive headphones or earbuds. That includes audio effects to make music sound like it's playing in a big concert hall, or signal processing to cancel noise like jet engines or rumbling trains. "All of those come into play if audio is in a digital domain," Saunders said, which would let phone makers offer premium features without having to sign deals with premium audio companies like Dolby or Bose. USB devices have controller chips that consume power. That's no problem for PCs with big batteries, but it is for phones. That's why the new USB audio standard requires power management abilities like turning off features that aren't being used, Saunders said. As a result, with USB headphones, "the difference in battery life is negligible" compared with 3.5mm audio jacks. There's another ability for USB on the way too: video. DisplayPort and HDMI are good for high-end video, but many people have more modest needs. An updated USB video technology under development will handle those needs -- and unlike HDMI and DisplayPort, will work even if people are using a USB hub to plug lots of devices into a single USB port on their laptop or phone. "It's not a replacement for HDMI," Ismail said. "It's good enough to do productivity work or watch movies, but not for a gaming system." Where you'll find USB Type-C already The USB Type-C connectors are new to many people but have started arriving on devices like the Apple MacBook and HP Spectre laptops as well as the Google Nexus 6P and Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones. The port is destined for greatness. The first advantage you'll find with USB Type-C is that the cables are reversible -- there's no fiddling with the cable to figure out which way is up. The next advantage is that Type-C can carry more power to charge your phone faster and even your laptop. With a new technology called USB Power Delivery, USB Type-C devices can handle nearly 100 watts of power, plenty to power all kinds of computers and devices that plug into them. USB Type-C also can carry DisplayPort video to external monitors. There's going to be a period of confusion, though, as we get used to the new standards. That's especially true since you won't be able to count on every USB port supporting every new USB feature. But the USB Implementers Forum that develops USB is happy with the port's progress, said President Jeff Ravencraft at the conference. "We have a single cable that can do pretty much everything you want it to," he said.

The deal, announced today at the Intel Developer Forum, is a strategic move from the Santa Clara, CA company to offer its large-scale custom chip manufacturing facilities, which include 10-nanometer production lines, to third-parties, including those using its rival's technology. I have a ton of Intel ARM devices already. Perhaps Intel could call these new chips "XScale". Just thought that up. I'm kind of proud of it.

Credit: Intel More like this IDF 2016: Powerful chips, robot brains, and super-fast data lasers Raspberry Pi 3 review: The revolutionary $35 mini-PC cures its biggest... Raspberry Pi Alternatives Emerge to Fill Need for Speed Video Reality check on the Internet of Things Intel has unleashed a new competitor to Raspberry Pi 3 with its new Joule development board, which packs in superior graphics and wireless connectivity. The chipmaker has loaded the development board with technology found in regular PCs: a 64-bit quad-core Atom processor, 4K graphics, 802.11ac connectivity, and DDR4 memory features. However, Joule doesn't compete on price with the Raspberry Pi, which sells for US$35. A high-end version of the Joule board is on sale at the Intel Developer Forum this week for $369.99. [ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] The Joule will provide big-time computing power for robots, drones, smart devices, and wearables. Like Raspberry Pi, Joule supports flavors of Linux and the Windows 10 IoT Core operating systems. Joule also supports Intel's 3D RealSense camera, which is being used in drones and robots, as well as virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. The camera can recognize gestures, track objects, measure distances, and if programmed correctly, recognize human emotions. The camera helps drones and robots avoid collisions. Price aside, the challenge for Intel is to get developers to accept the board. Intel's previous boards haven't been widely accepted, and many projects using Intel boards have been driven by the chipmaker. The Raspberry Pi has sold in the millions, and it has a thriving software development ecosystem around it. At IDF Tuesday, Intel showed the Joule chipset being used in a bartending robot and motorcycle helmet. But an interesting use was in a pair of smart glasses, helping a quality control worker conduct real-time analysis, with the glasses buzzing when there were problems with products.  This is by far the fastest of Intel's development boards, including Galileo Gen2 and Edison, which haven't been upgraded for years. Intel also offers the tiny Curie system used in wearables. Curie is also used in BMX bikes and in skateboards, providing real-time statistics to TV audiences. The Joule boards are available in two configurations. The Joule 570x has a 1.7GHz Atom T5700 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and 16GB of storage. The Joule 550x will have a 1.5GHz Atom T5500 CPU, 3GB of LPDDR4 memory, and 8GB of storage. The Joule systems will support 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, and USB 3.0. Like many developer boards, they will have standard GPIO, I2C and UART interfaces. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

Eric Jhonsa Aug 16, 2016 7:09 PM EDT Intel shows off a VR headset that doesn't need to be paired with a PC or phone Intel (INTC)  is intent on not getting left out as virtual reality and augmented reality headsets get launched left and right. The chip giant has used its latest Developer Forum to unveiled Project Alloy, a reference design for a virtual reality headset that -- unlike Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive or Sony's (SNE) PlayStation VR -- doesn't need to be paired with a high-end PC or gaming console to function. Facebook is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB? Learn more now. Rather, all of its processing power, no doubt provided by Intel silicon, is housed inside the headset. As is the case with many of its other hardware efforts, Intel's goal isn't to sell large quantities of hardware, but to sell chips to OEM partners whom it hopes will adopt its reference designs. Intel also promises Alloy headsets will be able to take in content from a user's real-world environment and bring it inside a virtual world. In addition, unlike the aforementioned rival hardware platforms, Alloy doesn't need any external sensors or cameras to be placed in the room where a headset is being used, or even any handheld controllers. These features are enabled by Intel's RealSense depth-sensing/motion-tracking camera technology. Alloy isn't alone in taking an all-in-one approach to VR: AMD (AMD) , which has worked hard to optimize its GPUs for VR, is partnering with startup Sulon Technologies to develop a headset that doesn't need any pairing.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums The budget CPU overclocking dream may still be alive at Intel by Jeff Kampman  5:55 PM on August 16, 2016 Intel's Pentium Anniversary Edition chip was a surprise to us when it launched a little over two years ago. Sure, that 53W chip offered just two cores and two threads, but the thing overclocked to 4.8GHz and kept pace with much beastlier chips from Intel and AMD in our review. Good times were had, and the chip became a fixture of our budget builds. When Skylake rolled around, however, a G3258 replacement wasn't among the many dual-core parts at the base of the towering sixth-gen Core processor model lineup. This omission made us sad. Sure, the Core i3-6100 is a great chip, but its $125 price tag is nearly double that of the $70 the Pentium Anniversary Edition still commands. In budget builds where every dollar counts, $55 could be the difference between a lower-end graphics card or a more powerful one, to name just one potential trade-off. Intel overclocking honcho Dan Ragland held a session about the overclocking features in Broadwell-E and Skylake processors today, and I caught up with him after to inquire about the prospect of future Pentium AE-esque products in upcoming generations of the company's CPUs. While Ragland unsurprisingly wouldn't commit to any definite statements about Intel's product roadmap, he did indicate that the extreme overclocking community has expressed strong interest in a Pentium AE successor, and that the company has been thinking about ways to expand processor overclocking to more value-oriented chips in the future. That's a glimmer of hope for those of us who just want to have fun with cheap CPUs. I wouldn't get too excited about the prospect of a Kaby Lake Pentium AE-type chip, though. Ragland cautions that Intel's first job is to turn a profit, and it doesn't take a genius to see that it's easier to get strong margins out of $220-$320 quad-core parts and $1650 ten-core CPUs than it is to justify a $70 part that can beat those chips at their own game. That said, whether strong per-core performance will rule thread count in the era of DirectX 12 and Vulkan, as it did when the Pentium G3258 first broke onto the scene, remains murky. We will never, ever complain about stronger IPC performance, but some very informal testing on our part shows that well-coded Vulkan titles like Doom can achieve Skylake Core i7-like performance on older eight-core AMD hardware, all else being equal. That behavior suggests Intel might not be at as much risk of cannibalizing its own model lineup with a strong dual-core part today as it might have been in the past. Whatever seventh-generation Core chips look like, eight-thread or even 20-thread chips might deliver performance commensurate with those bigger numbers in the future better than they do today.   Even with all that in mind, overclocking began as a way of beating The Man—the Mendocino Celeron 300A and its effortless 50% clock speed headroom is just one example. Given that heritage, it's no shock that Intel would rather not release another officially-sanctioned chip that can punch out parts higher in its model lineup. Still, Ragland didn't agree with my description of the Anniversary Edition chip as an anomaly in Intel's modern lineup, so I guess we'll just need to take his advice and stay tuned.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Intel unveiled a new virtual reality initiative dubbed “Project Alloy” during the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) on Tuesday. Project Alloy is a virtual reality headset that runs Windows Holographic, the special version of Windows that also powers Microsoft HoloLens, Slashgear explained. Unlike other PC-based solutions, Intel’s Project Alloy includes the full computing experience right inside the headset; there’s no need to plug it into a separate computer. The downside to that is the relative size of the headset that’s required to power the whole experience; Slashgear described it as “bulky,” and indeed that seems to be the case. Also, Intel might be the first with this form of VR headset, but there are other wireless options. Project Alloy, a 1st gen #VR solution – imagine merging realities and experience your world differently #IDF16 pic.twitter.com/ZUrKDZ57hT — Intel (@intel) August 16, 2016 Take, for example, Samsung and Oculus’ Gear VR. It’s powered by a smartphone, isn’t too bulky and doesn’t require a separate computer. Indeed, your phone is the computer that powers the whole Gear VR experience. Intel is trying to push the boundaries of what VR is capable of, however, by integrating motion sensors so that someone who wears Project Alloy can walk around. That’s something you certainly can’t safely do with a Gear VR. Slashgear said Intel plans to launch Project Alloy as a platform so that partners, those who no doubt want to use its RealSense cameras and processors, can launch devices built on the platform. Microsoft, as a partner, will provide Windows Holographic as the underlying software. The Allow Open Platform is expected to open to Intel’s partners during the second half of next year.

While no concrete details about the 7th Generation of Intel Core products lines were given, we were offered a couple of bits of information to tide the hype until a full launch. On the stage, support for HEVC Main10 Profile was announced with 7th Gen, although it was unclear if this was decode only or encode as well. This is still a step up from Skylake support, where Main10 required hybrid hardware/software decoding acceleration. Moving it into hardware for Kaby Lake will help with performance and power consumption, particularly of 4K content where HEVC vs. H.264 differences are bigger than Full-HD. The demo on stage showed GoPro software taking 4K data from six cameras and being able to switch between the content of each camera without stuttering or delay, on a 2-in-1 mobile device. For gaming, we were treated to a demonstration of Overwatch being run off of the 7th Gen IGP. That being said, it was not mentioned what the resolution or quality the game was running at, and V-Sync was not enabled. Intel clarified that the demos on the stage were from their highest performance CPUs, but the fact that only 2-in-1s were on display demonstrates that Kaby Lake will be focused on mobile first. The HP and Dell prototypes also add to the ASUS prototypes we saw at Computex earlier in the year. Intel stated that 7th Gen CPUs are already in the hands of partners, ready for production devices, and we should expect to see them in the hands of consumers this autumn.  Again, given the focus, it seems we will encounter Kaby Lake in mobile form factors (4W and 15W) before anything on desktop.

POST A COMMENT 35 Comments View All Comments Black Obsidian - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link As the owner of an Ivy Bridge-based NUC doing HTPC duty, I've been waiting for HEVC Main10 decode support (and HDMI 2.0) to upgrade. Looks like that'll be happening soon. Reply edzieba - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Are you sure you haven't been waiting for High Profile 10-bit support, not Main Profile? For media playback (BD and it's UHD successor) on an HTPC, High Profile support is the relevant encoding profile needed for playback. Reply Black Obsidian - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Full hardware support for High Profile would be ideal, but even partial support would be something. My Ivy Bridge NUC does H265 entirely in software, and chokes on 1080p content if there's any significant amount of on-screen movement. Reply nandnandnand - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link All I care about is how Kaby Lake mobile will do vs. Zen mobile APUs. Reply yannigr2 - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link It will have (much) higher IPC compared to Zen, (much) better energy efficiency compared to Zen and completely destroyed by Zen in the graphics section. Reply psychobriggsy - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link 1. Unknown as yet, IPC is likely to be in the same ballpark though (finally!) even if KL edges it by a few percent. Clock speeds at various TDPs and real-life battery usage are what matter in the end and these figures are a way off being tested. Maybe even Cannonlake will be the competition, not KL. 2. Unproven as yet - AMD had to implement a lot of energy saving on 28nm APUs and these will be migrated to 14nm APUs 3. Zen is a CPU core and doesn't do graphics. The Zen-based APU will likely use Vega level graphics however, and totally destroy the Intel graphics in all aspects. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link vega level would take too much power. something 460 sized would be about as big as a 125 watt APU could take. If they solve the bandwidth problem though, it would still be a major advantage over intel. Reply MrSpadge - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link By "Vega level" he means it's based on the same architecture level, not the size & performance of the chip. Reply smilingcrow - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link 3. Mobile these days generally means 15W or even less so it's not safe to assume that AMD's inherently better graphics prowess will allow them to compete with Intel at these power levels as it depends a lot on how good their fabrication partner is. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link all massive assumptions, given that intel typically lags behind GPU wise and we have yet to see zen cpus in action.

Email Address:  Photo courtesy Intel Intel Reveals Project Alloy, an All-in-one VR Headset With Mobile Positional Tracking By Ben Lang - Aug 16, 2016 49 407SHARES FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedinSubscribe The Entire VR Industry in One Little Email The Daily Roundup is our comprehensive coverage of the VR industry wrapped up into one daily email, delivered directly to your inbox.  Email Address Today at the Intel Developer Forum event in San Francisco, Intel revealed Project Alloy, an all-in-one mobile virtual reality headset which the company says will launch in 2017 as an “open platform.” On stage at IDF 2016, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled the new headset during the opening keynote. The Alloy headset, which has fully on-board processing and sensors, is said to be capable of tetherless virtual reality, thanks to an ‘inside-out’ positional tracking solution which doesn’t rely on external trackers. Photo courtesy Intel Tech specs on Project Alloy are slim for the time being, but the headset is said to have its own on-board processor (confirmed to be a “PC-class” 6th-generation Intel Core processor), as well as an array of the company’s ‘RealSense‘ cameras which handle a range of computer-processing functions. See Also: Oculus CTO Affirms Positional Tracking Priority for Gear VR Intel says that, tanks to RealSense, the headset will be capable of hand-detection, and it’s likely that the cameras will also track the space surrounding the user in order to provide tracking data. The company also says the headset is capable of “collision detection and avoidance,” enabling users to traverse large volumes of space without running into walls and other objects. We’ve seen inside-out positional tracking solutions attempted by a number of different companies; so far, we haven’t seen any that are robust or performant enough for real-world VR usage. SEE ALSO Intel Developing an Augmented Reality Headset Using RealSense, Report Suggests Intel further says that the headset will support mixed reality (which they’re calling “merged reality”), allowing applications to combine parts of the virtual world with the virtual world. For now, Intel is tight lipped on specs like resolution, field of view, weight, and battery life. But the company says that Project Alloy will be released in 2017 as an open reference design, upon which partners can build their own branded headsets. Photo courtesy Intel With a ‘hanging’ head mount design, Project Alloy’s ergonomics are decidedly more like Sony’s PlayStation VR headset than the Oculus Rift of HTC Vive. That’s good news, as we’ve found Sony’s headset to be among the most comfortable out there. IDF 2016 runs for the next two days, so we may see more of Project Alloy yet.

TAGS intel intel alloy intel headset intel project alloy intel vr headset Ben Lang Sebastien Mathieu and another headset in the bandwagon!!!, this is gonna be soooo confusing for the average users…. Will Should be OK if it works with Steam VR games, even better if Oculus supports it kalqlate Nope. The “average” user will simply say, “Hmm… I use Windows at home and at work, and this thing runs Windows without a cord. Yes, I’ll take this one. Thanks!” HTC Vive will quickly evolve to this platform. Oculus, on the other hand, will do the wrong thing and spin their wheels trying to get Zuck his money back, but with Intel, Microsoft, all of their partners, and EVERY maker group around the world making their own Alloy headsets, Oculus will finally give in or perish. Bob I agree that Oculus need to pull their head out of their ass and start getting to work on the next iteration. It’s a shame to see the ones that revitalized virtual reality through crowdfunding are now at the back of the queue in terms of consumer interest. It’s almost guaranteed at this point that their research team is working hard on delivering a headset device with significantly improved resolution, which is still a problem for all vr devices including this one, and a much wider fov. The first company to deliver at least 4K resolution per eye and 180 degree field of view in a simple lightweight package with excellent ergonomics and a strong software infrastructure to boot will eventually lead the pack. Price may still be an issue but for a device with these kind of technical specifications it’s hard not to salivate for one. For some reason I have a feeling Facebook have got something cooking up their sleeves. kalqlate With all the endless river of money they have backing them, I would hope Facebook has got something cooking. It had better be spicy and delicious. I think it’s too late for them to compete in the general market long term. What I see them doing instead is create Rift-exclusive access to the upcoming Facebook VR platform, a place where Facebook members can share their profiles and activities in slick and engaging VR environments, invite their friends into cool VR environments for immersive games and real-time telepresence activities, and to record VR activities/vlogs for later sharing. Given the billion+ users Facebook has, even if just 1% participate in Facebook VR, that will be 10 million Rift units sold in just one or two years. Estimating $100 profit on each sell of the Rift, that would get Zuck back half of his outlay in the first one or two years. If Facebook VR turns out to be a hit, and I suspect it will, the year following that will bring ten times the number of participants, thus 10 times the Rift sells, but they’ll have to keep Facebook VR exclusive to Rift for two to three years. Maybe they’ll allow Gear VR access, but that’s about it. After Zuck has made enough $billions off of Rift, he’ll announce Facebook VR compatibility with other VR devices, perhaps in the third or fourth years of its existence. Nigerian Wizard “a ‘PC-class’ 6th-generation Intel Core processor”. Jesus. Are we going to have to install fucking fans on our heads? Texazzpete It’s been a while since the first fanless Core M processors came out. Why the heck are you ignorant about fanless Intel Core CPUs? Nigerian Wizard This isn’t a core M processor. This is a gimped full fledged PC processor. kalqlate Look at the 15-watt’ers on the following page before YOUR core processor overheats: http://ark.intel.com/products/family/88392/6th-Generation-Intel-Core-i7-Processors#@All. Not even enough heat for an ant trying to use it as a foot warmer. Get Schwifty! Yeah, I too am curious about this Intel chip application… and power with heat especially with the inside-out tracking load. OTOH, the fact Intel is actually taking notice and developing a product that isn’t just a repeat of the Vive/Rift approach is refreshing. It’s also intriguing that both VIve and Rift might have made design errors in the ergonomics if it’s really the case that the “hanging head” design really is that much more comfortable. Will Somebody’s gotta do it. Releasing it as a reference design for partners seems promising. Wish everyone would get on that PSVR ergonomics tip too. Oh, and hot-swappable batteries… Augure Hot swappable battery is an horrible, wasting, polluting solution and shouldn’t exist anymore in 2016. If you need your batterie to be swapped on a headset that should be use more than 3 hours by a single user, then you’re doing things way wrong. Will It seems like half the promise of mobile VR is essentially larping, or large scale multiplayer experiences, competitive or otherwise. The value of being able to re-up your power source on the go without “jacking-out” appears inherent, particularly in a competitive long form scenario. As to it being wasteful, I’m not sure how hot-swappable batteries are more polluting than batteries that require you to power down and reboot your device to install. user2 i dont think that it is a good idea. vr as an addition to a mobile phone, a pc or a console is much more attractive than another computer. a vr version of the nuc with a headset, that’s what they should make imho. kalqlate The following article gives a little more details and alludes to the idea that the device will also be compatible with “mainstream PCs”, perhaps in an optional tethered mode: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602189/intel-and-microsoft-are-teaming-up-to-make-virtual-reality-ubiquitous. Augure What a huge missed opportunity. Everyone’s waiting for such a untethered VR headset that use a RealSense/Leap/Kinect like sensors to do dual-lens AR, reverse tracking and hand tracking. But a having a bulky and useless “PC-Class” module attached to it, instead of going for the other thing everyone is waiting for, you now, actual fucking wireless in 2016? Because this is never going to be as portable and versatile as a smartphone or as powerful and complete as a PC, the Intel processor is useless, especially with their notoriously crappy video cards. What a missed opportunity damn. Let’s see what Google Daydream will bring, Google is one of those hysterically stupid and inefficient companies with all the keys in their hands that they yet don’t use. Texazzpete They could also go for starships to fly to a nearby galaxy. Just because you want something doesn’t mean the tech is available and economically feasible. Augure STFU you loser. Texazzpete Your childish posts are all the more amusing since you’re almost certainly an adult. Grow up. Augure It’s better to be a vulgar adult, than a completely stupid worthless adult loser like you. I’m talking about your previous comment specifically, not you of course. Rob H You realise there’s not situation where you don’t look like a baby throwing his dummy out the pram, right? Do you think the manufacturers just like wires? “But a having a bulky and useless “PC-Class” module attached to it, instead of going for the other thing everyone is waiting for, you now, actual fucking wireless in 2016?” Having a dense useless idiot commenting on a post about the progression of VR technology demanding things that are currently technologically unfeasible, instead of going for the thing everyone is waiting for you to do, get a fucking education in 2016? Augure Or instead, don’t be a fucking sub-human loser dragging the human race down when it’s literally a news: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/04/quark-vr-wireless-htc-vive-prototype/ And actually…not a news since there are dozens of tech comps doing this since I don’t know…2/3 years already. And more importantly these companies are few, sometimes one man endeavour with no budget while big companies are not even fucking doing their job. Or the worse being that because of unperceptive limited monkeys like you who don’t get shit about the world, the market sociological mechanics and technological momentum VR might either drag for 10 years before picking-up. And please, it’s 2016 and it’s the internet, these insult are not personal they’re poetically vulgar expression of the violent emotion I feel when I read stupid shit like yours, I don’t care of have anything against you. Rob H Sorry you feel facts and intelligence are “dragging the human race down” so i’m I’m guessing you have autism as it’s the only explanation for your retarded comments. And just because my little cousin believes in the tooth fairy doesn’t mean she exists, no more than just because you believe the crap your writing makes working wireless hmds a reality. If you want wireless hmds, you’re talking future tech, not current. Valve seems to be the closest as far as im aware as they have claimed they’re working in conjunction with another company (cant remember who) and have a demo due “this fall” but clearly stated its not ready as they still haven’t overcome all the technical difficulties related to the limited transfer rate of data wireless connections have. I mean, fair enough, you could argue there are already wireless hmds – get google cardboard and stream your pc to your phone. That doesn’t mean its any good and ready for serious use. Go fucking educate yourself before you continue spouting bullshit and making an even bigger fool of yourself than you already have. BUT, i’d be quite happy to be proven wrong on this. I’m willing to let you prove how right you are and how wrong I am, here’s your chance to prove you’re right -> Go ahead, list the “dozens of tech companies” with these working wireless hmds that are consumer grade technology matching those on the market – but of course we who actually have these things called braincells know that’s not something you can do and that statement was in fact a complete fabrication, but go ahead try, ill wait; BTW I’m expecting a list of at the very least 24 seeing as you’ve stated there’s at least this many. P.s. do you really think anyone is offended by “loser” – it’s clear as day just reading the first couple of sentences of your misinformed whiny posts that you’re the only one here with no real life friends xD You’re attitude is exactly the same as some spoilt little brat as Christmas crying because Santa’s elves didn’t bring you the fully functional iron man suit you demanded on your list. Grow the fuck up and wake up to reality. Augure Oh so you’re bigoted against people with autism? Yet you’re the one who don’t know how to fucking read (and Google)? I POSTED you the most recent factual news about wireless HMD and told you there are dozens of companies with wireless VR technologies under the form of processors, wireless antennas or even actual HMDs you fucking loser. “I mean, fair enough, you could argue there are already wireless hmds – get google cardboard and stream your pc to your phone” wait so you even make the statement yourself you fucking degenerate? Wireless HMD is a MUST-HAVE for mass-market adoption, like hand-motion tracking is, and all manufacturers are starting (a little late) to realise it, probably because the domain is circled by unperceptive ignorant losers like you who think that something that is not only feasible and actually obligatory doesn’t even exist. Rob H Never said anything is bad about being autistic, i hold nothing against you for it as it’s not like you can help it but it does explain your pathetic bullshit rant. And yeh you posted a link to one hmd that are TRYING to create a consumer quality wireless headset and have clearly stated themselves THE TECH ISN’T FUCKING READY YET. It’s not “starting a little late” at all, it’s technically unfeasable at this point as has been the entire development cycle of VR headsets so far. Most developers that have released hmds have nearly all stated they’d love it to be wireless but at this point in time, it’s simply not possible to have a quality, consumer level vr experience and it also be wireless. There’s plenty of research into its development – This doesn’t mean they can suddenly pull a working one out a magicians hat. Seriously, stop acting like some spoilt little shit just because you don’t actually have a clue how the real world works. Are you simply suggesting manfacturers and developers should just stop trying to give consumers products they want and are the best of what is currently available in terms of technology because you think they should only release technology that doesn’t even exist yet? Do you think when the first b&w box tvs were released they should have waited instead til the flatscreen 4k 3d hdr tvs were ready instead? Seriously, learn what product & industry progression are. And, I’m still waiting for these “dozens” of examples, sounds like there are so many you’ll have no problems listing at least 24 with these working wireless consumer grade hmds. So please, go ahead…(oh, and using an example that have themselves admitted that their tech isn’t anything like ready yet isn’t supporting your argument xD It support the fact you’re acting like some spoil brat demanding things that’s not yet possible.) As for your last paragraph, are you actually that dense? The only ignorant person here is you as you obviously live in some fantasy land…wireless hmd tech is simply not fucking ready yet no matter how much you throw your dummy out the pram over it. It’s being researched, get it into your thick head. It’s not going to suddenly leap a couple of years forward technology wise just because some sad little shit like you is demanding it in the comment section.Neither should the rest of the world not be able to buy things that are the best currently available because you want something that’s simply not possible at this point in time. Grow up user2 i still hope that daydream will be just that: a headset with tango and maybe a screen which connects to your smartphone. all smartphone manufacturers have their low(er) cost headsets already, so daydream must be something else. Augure Yup a high-end Tango enabled smartphone would open many doors. As far as the Galaxy S8 rumours go in terms of resolution, ram etc…seems to be going the right way, but clearly VR has been lagging too much. Will Project Alloy is a self-contained device; there is no need for an attached “module”. It is indeed what you describe waiting for, an untethered headset with inside-out positional tracking, dual lense AR, and hand tracking. As for wireless, I read about a solution here that the military uses for their simulations that seems to work stable, and is on its way to the consumer market (though it requires a pendant or hip pack, because *). Unfortunately there are still two problems with this: first, unless it can operate on a citywide scale through an integrated network, it will never be able to offer a truly free roaming experience, and even then doubtfully ever in rural areas. Secondly, *almost no one wants a radio transmitter that close to their brain. Augure Consumer version doesn’t mean military use. If you can use Internal AR headset with a regular PC or mobile HMD, it’d be great to use at home, office or exhibitions first and foremost. The main problem here is that nobody wants to NOT be able to use their own system, PC or mobile, AND have to use a limited and supplementary one which adds to the bulk of the headset. In fact I wished their was a project allow that would either get rid of this bulk and be usable with any computer with a simple cable OR have a high-end smartphone system like mobile HMDs. But then, that’s why the absolute best solution, is still going to be a Smartphone VR Headset with the capability of the Alloy, which I think only Google Tango seems to be cable of now. Will It all depends on the cost of the thing. If it’s in the ballpark of the Rift and Vive, and you can also tether it to a computer, then it’s a home run. Even if it’s somewhat more expensive, the value that it offers is exceptional. To have a full PC experience on the go can’t be understated. I love my Gear VR, but it’s not quite the same, and I’m constantly paranoid about scratching the screen; it also doesn’t tether to a PC. The S7 is an $800 investment as well, and if I don’t need my phone to double as a VR headset, I can spend a lot less on it. That being said, I actually really like the idea of Project Tango being integrated with Daydream. Hopefully that comes to pass. I’ve always wanted a phone that’s powerful enough to be the guts of a family of products, like a tablet shell, laptop case, home console, and VR headset all powered by a beast of a phone. There’s always Magic Leap to think about as well. If you’re interested in the wireless military tech that’s moving to consumer, here’s that link: http://www.roadtovr.com/serious-simulations-claim-their-zero-frame-latency-tech-can-make-vr-headsets-wireless/ Taziar The only way to have wireless video would be lossy video compression, reducing quality. Further, it takes quite a bit of processing power to compress 90hz 1080p+ video real time. Processing power already being used to create the content. And most importantly, compressing, transmitting, and decompressing video adds latency, the biggest killer of VR immersion. Augure True, wireless video has to be lossless which would means raw quality and no-latency. Such wireless video processor are at the horizon but the standards, codecs and such have to be pushed and experimented with now. kalqlate This current new generation of VR is still evolving. There is still ample room to innovate. The following article, which gives a little extra detail, informs… Myerson also boasted that Intel and Microsoft had found ways to run virtual-reality applications on less powerful PCs than the ones the Oculus and HTC headsets rely on. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602189/intel-and-microsoft-are-teaming-up-to-make-virtual-reality-ubiquitous Have you personally experienced HaloLens? If a VR version has computing built in and proper FOV, how is that not a great solution? (Bear in mind that the consumer price of such a device will surely come in at less than $999.) The reason why no one is doing wireless is because there’s still way too much latency in wirelessly transmitting the computed hi-res video to the headset. When that is finally conquered, then, yes… your wireless VR dreams will come true. Augure The Headset is too bulky, it actually makes the untethered cord point moot. Also nobody wants to use a untethered VR headset that isn’t connected to an actual computer or smartphone platform. I’ve experienced HoloLens, it was a letdown until it actually made me understand that AR glasses are not around the corner at all and are in the 5-10 years horizon before they can reach current VR headset standards. That’s why I said I’ve been waiting for a Internal AR/VR Headset like this one but if I can’t using with my actual system, be it computer, console or smartphone, it’s completely useless. In fact that’s the most sought after functionality of the Gear/Mobile VR: untethered AND cabled streaming from different machines. kalqlate You lamented: The Headset is too bulky, it actually makes the untethered cord point moot. All VR headsets are bulky. The key to success is comfort for long-term use. That’s the point of the Alloy design as indicated at the end of this article: With a ‘hanging’ head mount design, Project Alloy’s ergonomics are decidedly more like Sony’s PlayStation VR headset than the Oculus Rift of HTC Vive. That’s good news, as we’ve found Sony’s headset to be among the most comfortable out there. As you know, once you’re immersed in VR, the bulk of the headset doesn’t matter… except if its weight is present on your face. The Alloy design mitigates that better than the Oculus and Vive designs. Therefore, bulk (size) is only an issue when you’re looking at it from the outside. Who cares when you’re on the inside? You said: Also nobody wants to use a untethered VR headset that isn’t connected to an actual computer or smartphone platform. :D Nobody? :D Clairvoyant Augure knows all, sees all. :D Actually, your statement makes no sense. For computer use, most people’s current systems are not up to spec for tethered VR headsets. Solution: buy a new, more powerful computer, For phone use, either people will be satisfied with Cardboard quality or will buy a new, more powerful Samsung smartphone (that they don’t currently have) for use with Gear VR. Therefore, introducing a device that has on-board rendering power somewhere between Gear VR and a PC is the smarter purchase when a purchase is most likely necessary anyway. I’m currently satisfied with my Nexus phone. I do not want to buy a new Samsung phone or other high-quality phone just to experience Gear VR or any other high-quality phone-based VR. Further, it has been recently revealed that Microsoft has filed a patent for a HaloLens type device that has a shield that electronically darkens and lightens to support AR/VR/MR in one device. Seriously, why would you desire to be tethered to a box in one room when if that box can be shrunk into your untethered headset, you can roam your ENTIRE 3-D mapped home or office as if it were dark and spooky catacombs, a future spaceport, or expansive museum? You said: I’ve experienced HoloLens, it was a letdown until it actually made me understand that AR glasses are not around the corner at all and are in the 5-10 years horizon before they can reach current VR headset standards. Too bad you were disappointed by HaloLens. I went into my demo being extremely skeptical of the puny FOV. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised when it didn’t spoil the AR effect at all. The sense of immersion was complete for me. You said: That’s why I said I’ve been waiting for a Internal AR/VR Headset like this one but if I can’t using with my actual system, be it computer, console or smartphone, it’s completely useless. “Completely useless”??? :D … that’s a good one! Along with the “nobody” above, you’re showing that you’re prone to exaggeration. To repeat the quote from the article I previously cited and presented in my prior comment: Myerson also boasted that Intel and Microsoft had found ways to run virtual-reality applications on less powerful PCs than the ones the Oculus and HTC headsets rely on. This may be alluding to the idea that Alloy can be tethered or untethered. I get the same impression about Google’s Daydream device. On this point, we’ll have to wait and see. We should know in December this year when the specs are revealed. :) Sorry that we’re not five to ten years in the future for the type of device you’re looking for. What you see in devices like Alloy and HaloLens is current state-of-the-art. Maybe Magic Leap’s upcoming device will satisfy all of your desires. Until then, you can just sit it out while many many others of us enjoy what is available or nearly available. Augure What you or I think doesn’t matter, unless you work in prospective. NOBODY, meaning a too unsignificant portion of the market will want a project Alloy, which means this project will disappear and is useless (given they’re rarely iterated when they fail). But I can agree that the integrated computing is not so much a problem, in fact you made me realise it might even find used in untethered situation like pre-installed experiences for exhibitions, augmented gaming etc… The main problem is when using it as a system, nobody wants to have an additional device that is neither a versatile smartphone nor a powerful computer. And if there’s not way to use/tether it with a PC then this is not a good VR usage solution, just a limited untethered showcase solution. As for Magic Leap, since it’s vaporware I’d rather wait for Daydream. kalqlate The main problem is when using it as a system, nobody wants to have an additional device that is neither a versatile smartphone nor a powerful computer. I will leave it to you to answer the question: What percentage of people who would like to experience VR from time to time have a phone or computer system that is NOW compatible with VR other than Cardboard? I have a Nexus 5, and I’m COMPLETELY happy with it. I have a PC that is fully high-end VR capable, but I absolutely will not opt in on tethered VR, though I have experienced and love both the Rift and Vive. I’m sure that there are many others like me… as indicated by the relatively slow sales of VR headsets. Google DayDream will be a great solution for those who are ready to buy a new phone. For people like me, who aren’t interested in a new phone or the tethered experience, an Alloy is the ticket. You say “nobody” because you feel strongly about your needs and wants. Remember though… not everyone is you. :) you made me realise it might even find used in untethered situation like pre-installed experiences for exhibitions, augmented gaming, etc. Why just “pre-installed”? Headsets like Alloy and Daydream map your environment. There is already software that will RE-map the corridors and rooms of one environment to another environment, and I’m sure such algorithms will be employed in “experiences for exhibitions, augmented gaming, etc.” that you can have in your home or office. So, why just “pre-installed”? Where’s your imagination? The main benefit of Alloy over a tethered solution is that your ENTIRE current environment (not just one room), however big or small it may be, can be used as the boundaries that the game or exhibition map themselves to, whether that is re-mapping from some other environment or as the default characteristic for the exhibition or game to adjust itself to whatever physical environment it finds itself in. Will Why do you think Magic Leap is vaporware? It only just received it’s first venture funding in 2014. The Rift was Kickstarted in 2012 and didn’t release until this year. Augure Everybody sane knows Magic Leap is vaporware. It’s strange because I had a Rift as far as 2013…fucking hypocrite. Will Magic Leap utilises a well studied technology demonstrated by Nvidia and MIT. In the past two years there has been over $1.5 billion invested in them by companies like Google and Alibaba as recently as February with $800 million invested at that time. In June they partnered with Lucasfilm. They’ve been evaluated by Forbes and the Financial Times at over $4 billion inside of 2016. These are not companies without significant resources to investigate their decisions. What basis do you have for labeling it as vaporware? Augure Do you remember that “company that revolutionised renewable energy thanks to a magic energy cell based on a secret beach sand formula” in which Google, Microsoft and such and such invested millions if not billions for a few “mysterious boxes” of which nobody knows the content but that would magically produce energy for their buildings? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RehT-Do9bs DO you remember? Because I do and guess what: NOBODY ever saw the colour of one of those “revolutionary” boxes, that replace NONE of the energy grid in the country or elsewhere, of which we still have no idea how and even IF they work. Yet Google invested in it. That’s called money laundering vaporware but you probably don’t know what I’m talking about. Will I’m actually quite interested in money laundering. In many ways it is an important part of our economy, and a main driver of the Grey Market. It’s just that usually money laundering is only a necessity of criminal organizations, as legitimate corporations can simply shelter their money through tax havens, political lobbying, and loopholes effectively enough to avoid the unnecessary risk of full scale illegal action. I’m not sure when the last time you checked in with Bloom Energy was, but there are actually quite a few companies using their products. The new Apple campus will be powered at least partly by Bloom, and even smaller locations like some Home Depot stores already use their generators. They may not be quite as competitive as Ballard(once considered vaporware long before Bloom) in the on-site(or vehicle) fuel cell sector, but they certainly aren’t failed by any stretch. It still remains true that both Ballard and Bloom have proven fuel cells as a viable alternative going forward. I think they may have just overestimated the appeal and value their technology would offer by the time it came to market versus the advancement of on-site technologies like solar paired with a high efficiency Lithium battery, or perhaps supercapacitors in a few years. Still, I wonder why you think specifically Magic Leap, such a young company with so many glowing first person reports, and so much investment so recently, would be a fraudulent money laundering operation? Augure In the real world, even for big corporations, Fiscal Optimisation or Tax Evasion only take you so far. Large scale and shared sector money laundering is actually nothing new, here’s another concrete example: remember catching the H1N1 virus? Neither do I, or the billions of people who were lied to in their face that there was an imminent “pandemic”, which even the W.H.O. ended-up backtracking on. Yet, dozens of governments around paid hundreds of millions dollars to pharmaceutical companies in order to buy vaccines of which 90% went to waste. Want better? A friends of mine investigated for the account of medical institutions on the H1N1 and found something that you can easily find yourself on Google: 6 months before the H1N1 even existed, the biggest pharms (Sanofi, Bayer, Merck etc…) invested millions in the construction of “pre-emptive vaccine production factories, in the eventual case of flu-like pandemic”…right in fucking Mexico. You know the rest: 6 months after (which makes it impossible to have predicted or anticipated the appearances of a new flu-mutation) worldwide medias started declaring the first case of a pig-flu occurring in…Mexicos. If you haven’t hovered close to the “sun” of big corporations then you probably don’t know what they are capable of and how they operate. And that’s why, I’m confident (although definitive proofs would infer a serious investigative journalism that could threaten me or would end this scheme) that the same Bloom Energy was a scam from the get-go, Magic Leap is vaporware: it’s in every aspect of what hear, how we hear about and what actually is. We know what’s possible in terms of A.R. and how thanks to research and patents; NONE of the Magic Leap patents refers to a “specific revolutionary AR” technology that fits the narrative and actual description of the product. And the fact that the same big companies that aliened behind the same kind of vague if not meaningless PR with the same unfounded hyperboles that nobody in the crowd got infos or proofs of, is sign that it’s absolute bullshit. And the only point of such schemes, when millions and even billions is invested in something that has not even one real occurence or demonstration in years, is the sign of an advanced, high-level money laundering scheme (as soon as you invest money in any companies, there are millions of ways to retrieve it or detaxe it)… Will I think perhaps we have different definitions of what money laundering is. In order for money to be dirty, it must have been gained from criminal enterprise. The point of the laundering is to move cash from the Black or Grey market, and into the view of the government, where it can be taxed and spent legitimately. It is very inefficient, and the reason gangsters often engage in an economy of trade, swapping drugs, sex, people, murder, and stolen goods in place of money. Crucially, a successful business is generally required to launder large amounts of money. It’s extra hard to cook the books on a money pit, and the larger the pit the more attention you draw. Defrauding the government of billions of dollars on their own soil, including the inevitable collateral damage of all the genuine, naive money invested in good faith alongside your knowingly criminal cash, is a great way to end up investigated by a hundred lawyers from a hundred angles, from defrauded investors, tax collectors, and all manner of law enforcement, not to mention your competitors, who would gladly see you fail, and already bring legal action against you at every opportunity. This is all so incredibly risky that I just don’t see how a company like Google, with a vast, publicly visible tax stream, would also feel the need to not only engage in invisible, illegal fund creation, but also bother to bring that money, through laundering, into full view of the American government within their own borders by defrauding countless people. I can’t even imagine what criminal activities they could engage in that would produce literal billions of dollars in need of laundering, or indeed what methodology they would use to extract or even initially invest such money into a company that ends up failing. It’s so much easier just to create wealth by creating successful businesses and reaping the rewards. The H1N1 pandemic is an interesting example, and possibly a real one, but I don’t see how it’s analogous. Do you posit that it was also a money laundering scheme? If so, whose money was laundered? It seems more likely to be a simple creation of short term supply in demand, if not a coincidence. The H1N1 virus was and is real, and so is the vaccine. The only thing possibly fabricated was the extent of it’s danger, though it did still kill tens of thousands of people in hundreds of countries, it did not outstrip the regular flu virus in it’s death toll or reach. But it’s still a real virus that kills people, and the vaccine is not vaporware; it delivered as promised. I notice you also avoid comment on Bloom Energy’s continued progress, and that of their very similar competitor in Ballard. It’s interesting because that’s a much more direct comparison to your argument against Magic Leap. Both examples relied on well know, though hard to harness technologies. Bloom with using fuel cells to create reliable and efficient electricity, and Magic Leap with using Photonic Chips to create convincing lightfields. In both cases the technology is well understood and just requires advancement, and in both cases demonstrations of the technology were completed directly with investors in the beginning and not publicly. I would point to LucasArts’ involvement with Magic Leap as inscrutable if they weren’t actually presented with and impressed by working technology. They’ve invested no money, just partnered to provide content creation, which they’ve demonstrated publicly themselves. Why would LucasArts and Disney go to this effort if they couldn’t reasonably expect to recoup development costs? WyrdestGeek I don’t know about Magic Leap, specifically, but more generally Augure kinda has a point. Another really recent example: Theranos– super-fast blood testing? Nope. But lots of people said lots of things about how it was totes awesome. https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/13/theranos-debacle-threatens-investment-diagnostic-testing/ People and organizations–even including powerful people and organizations–can allow themselves to be misled. Regarding Magic Leap– I choose to remain wishful thinkingly optimistic that it will be awesome. But that’s a luxury I can afford because I’m not actually investing anything (time or money) into it. I just listen to podcasts and read this webpage. — Furry cows moo and decompress. Will Being misled is a little different than a vast billion dollar criminal conspiracy that involves collusion from parties on all sides for the express purpose of laundering money which by definition itself must have come from illegal enterprises. I wouldn’t discount out of hand the fact that Magic Leap could be misleading some people, I’m just not sure what the basis is at this stage for being so sure that they are completely misleading everyone involved – especially when there are so many positive eyewitness accounts, and the technology has been proven out by 3rd parties. WyrdestGeek I hope this pans out. Lack of positional tracking in mobile impairs presence pretty badly. jimrp Just glad they are trying it means a better tomorrow.

Torch your touch screen. As soon as next year, you'll be able to use an augmented-reality headset as your primary PC, running Windows apps that float in front of your face and that you control with your hands and voice. Today at Intel Developer Forum (IDF) 2016, Microsoft's Terry Myerson announced that next year a major update to Windows 10 will give anyone with a compatible headset the ability to run the Windows Holographic Shell with both 3D and traditional 2D apps. Developers will have to build 3D apps to enable rich experiences, like looking at a working solar system in your living room, but users don't need to wait for a whole new software ecosystem. Windows Holographic will let them project their favorite current-day software onto the walls, the air and the furniture. Multitasking on Steroids Right now, I love connecting my laptop to two external full-HD monitors so I can have more screen real estate for multitasking. But what if I could use my entire office, even the furniture, as a desktop that holds dozens of windows? I'd probably retire my laptop for good. In a demo video that Microsoft released, a woman wearing a generic-looking headset browses the web in Edge browser on one side of the room, then turns her gaze to a floating Outlook email on another side. Icons for other apps such as Skype sit on a table in front of her. We don't know for sure yet whether every present-day windowed app will run as 2D in Holo, but it looks like you'll be able to use a lot of them. Perhaps they'll need to be Universal Apps, a new kind of program that was introduced with Windows 10. However, I'm hoping that even the command-line programs will make the cut. Why should you have to take your headset off, even to run a batch file? MORE: How to Use Windows 10 How You'll Work in Windows Holographic We also can't tell exactly how you'll interact with 2D apps in the Holo UI. In the video, the woman uses what looks like a remote control to scroll through information in her web browser and uses her actual hands to play with a 3D, virtual dog. However, if you're going to do any kind of work, you'll probably need a keyboard for typing. That keyboard could be virtual, but I think that, for the foreseeable future, most people will prefer having some kind of tactile feedback. In five or 10 years, perhaps you will get the tactile feedback from VR gloves, but that's not coming anytime soon. You could dictate all your documents, but talking your computer through a 1,000-word report is more than a little awkward. The only consumer who can afford a HoloLens is Bill Gates, and he probably already got one for free. The High Price of Headsets The $64,000 question is whether everyday people will be able to have these amazing holographic experiences. The Windows 10 update will undoubtedly be free and will be capable of running on fairly pedestrian PCs. At IDF, Myerson showed that a $600 Intel Skull Canyon NUC mini PC, which has integrated graphics, was capable of running Holo at 90 fps. However, we don't know what the necessary headsets will cost. Right now, the only two shipping products that can support Windows Holographic apps are the $3,000 Microsoft HoloLens and the $799 HTC Vive, which requires at least a $1,000 PC. Because it can go wireless, the HoloLens is clearly the better of the two, but the only consumer who can afford one is Bill Gates, and he probably already got one for free. Computers moved from the desk to the lap. Now they're going to your head. Could Project Alloy Make AR Affordable? At IDF, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced Project Alloy, a new VR/AR headset reference design that sounds like it's at least as good as HoloLens. The new device features dual RealSense cameras and can track both the room around you and your hands, without any additional sensors. It is completely wireless, battery-powered and, in a demo, looked pretty lightweight. MORE: 5 Ways Intel's Vision Will Change VR Intel isn't going to make or sell Project Alloy, just share the reference design with manufacturers so that OEMs can build their own headsets based on it. Having lots of different companies making their own devices should drive prices down, but we have no idea what a reasonably priced Alloy headset will cost. In order to really replace most consumer PCs, a fully functional wireless headset should cost under $600 and include everything you need to run Windows Holographic. What are the chances we'll get anywhere near that price range in 2017? Today, the $599 Oculus Rift requires a PC and doesn't have the cameras needed to run Windows Holographic, but it's made by only one company. When Acer, Asus, Lenovo and Dell all start making their own headsets, the prices will drop, but how fast is anyone's guess. The Bottom Line Computers started in giant rooms filled with vacuum tubes. Over the years, the machines moved to your desk, your lap and your pocket. Now they're going right to your head. Because it's built on the most popular OS in the world, Windows Holographic is the perfect platform to usher in this next age of computing, the era of augmented reality. Running a Holographic UI could mark a bigger change in how people work and play than the advent of smartphones or the internet … as long as they can afford it. ✖ Windows 10 Basics Upgrade to Windows 10 From Windows 7 or 8 7 Settings to Change Right Away Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts to Save You Clicks 5 Ways to Take Screenshots Change Your Password in Windows 10 Uninstall Programs in Windows 10 Enable or Disable Tablet Mode Add a User (Child or Adult) All Windows 10 Tips Upgrade to Windows 10 From Windows 7 or 8 7 Settings to Change Right Away Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts to Save You Clicks 5 Ways to Take Screenshots Change Your Password in Windows 10 Uninstall Programs in Windows 10 Enable or Disable Tablet Mode Add a User (Child or Adult) All Windows 10 Tips Next How-to »» «« Previous Tip Next Tip »» Windows 10 Basics Upgrade to Windows 10 From Windows 7 or 8 7 Settings to Change Right Away Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts to Save You Clicks More Tips Upgrade to Windows 10 From Windows 7 or 8 7 Settings to Change Right Away Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts to Save You Clicks 5 Ways to Take Screenshots Change Your Password in Windows 10 Uninstall Programs in Windows 10 Enable or Disable Tablet Mode Add a User (Child or Adult) All Windows 10 Tips Author Bio Avram Piltch, LAPTOP Online Editorial Director The official Geeks Geek, as his weekly column is titled, Avram Piltch has guided the editorial and production of Laptopmag.com since 2007.

Devindra Hardawar, writing for Engadget: We've seen plenty of unique dev kits from Intel, including the SD card-sized Edison, but not one as powerful as this. Intel announced Joule today, a tiny maker board that will allow developers to test RealSense-powered concepts and, hopefully, bring the to the market faster than before. The company says the tiny, low-powered Joule would be ideal for testing concepts in robotics, AR, VR, industrial IoT and a slew of other industries. And it also looks like it could be an interesting way for students to dabble in RealSense's depth-sensing technology in schools. There will be two Joule kits to choose from: the 550x, which includes a 1.5GHz quad-core Atom T5500 processor, 3GB of RAM and 8GB of storage; and the 570x, which packs in a 1.7Ghz quad-core Atom T5700 CPU (with burst speeds up to 2.4GHz), 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Both models include "laptop-class" 802.11AC wireless, Intel graphics with 4K capture and display support, and a Linux-based OS. intel developers culture ← Related Links → Cable Expands Broadband Domination as AT&T and Verizon Lose Customers Intel Breaks Qualcomm's Hold On Apple's Baseband Chips Windows UAC Bypass Permits Code Execution This discussion has been archived.

Personally, i feel putting a real ssd on here, or a spspiny disk for swap/temp file userver makes the offering far more robust. I see it has what looks like a mini pie riser zif connector over on the side there, but that means buying in even deeper into their proprietary hardware stream.

For more data intensive applications, there is a sixteen gig version.

You wanna play rough, Samsung? Okay Project Alloy ... Chipzilla's open-source VR headgear (Source: Intel) 16 Aug 2016 at 22:19, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles ARM: Hold my beer, we'll install patches for your crappy IoT gear for you Suse: Question. What do you call second-place in ARM enterprise server linux? Answer: Red Hat Today the web was broken by countless hacked devices – your 60-second summary IDF16 Intel has vowed to open up its new all-in-one Project Alloy virtual reality headset, unveiled today at its Developer Forum in San Francisco. Alloy is described as "an open hardware platform," and will rival Samsung's Gear VR and similar virtual reality goggles. Alloy is powered by an Intel chipset and RealSense cameras, and, most importantly, it is wireless. You're supposed to pop it on and freely walk around your home or office or wherever and explore a 3D pretend world without tripped over or being limited by a cord connected to a computer. It also doesn't need any motion sensors placed around you to sense your movements. This is opposed to head-mounted displays that are tethered by a cable to a PC and need sensors on poles around you to detect you walking and moving your hands. Instead, the Alloy uses cameras mounted on its front to map out the real physical space around you: if you get too close to someone else or a wall or object in the real world while wandering around in your make-believe world, the software renders the obstacle in your display to let you know you're about to fall out of a window or step on the cat. This was demonstrated on stage at IDF this morning when an Intel staffer wearing the goggles almost walked into Chipzilla CEO Brian Krzanich standing a few feet from him: Big Brian's face loomed large in virtual space ship world. Those same cameras detect your hands in front of you, showing them in the virtual display and allowing you to manipulate things in the pretend world. You can even use things in your hands as tools in the virtual universe. On stage, an Intel staffer pulled out a small wad of folded dollar bills, held them up and used them to cut into a malleable object in the virtual world. Gotta hand it to Intel ... How your arms appear in a virtual world while wearing Alloy specs There's a battery in the strap that goes around the back of your head, and the device's weight is balanced so it sits on your head rather than rolling forward or back off your bonce. There are no technical specifications available yet. Vows ... Chipzilla's promised to come up with a standard for Windows 10-compatible head-mounted displays and an open Alloy design Intel said it will "open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem, allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products from the Alloy design, in 2017." This means it should be possible for people to build their own Alloy goggles and hook them up, wirelessly, to their computers. "Anybody can take the Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class virtual reality system with any manufacturer they choose," said Krzanich. So, open provided you use Windows, it seems. Let's hope Alloy fares better than Intel's Project Tango smartphone, which was touted for $399 in January, and offered to developers so they could experiment with mobile apps and its RealSense motion detection camera. That handset was quietly axed in July amid Intel's exit from the smartphone processor world. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Microsoft splashes Virtual Reality-slinging 'Scorpio' Xbox Console set to land in time for Christmas ... next year 41 Comments Virtual reality will take over the world by 2020, reckons analyst haus Psst.

However, Project Alloy, as the headset is being called, won’t actually compete head-to-head with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Instead, it’s meant to be a reference design for other manufacturers — and a long-term bet to keep Intel relevant in the nascent virtual reality space. Project Alloy is at its core a standalone headset that works without any external computer, and also doesn’t require users to plug in their own mobile phones. This sets it apart from both the more expensive Rift-type VR hardware and cheaper mobile VR headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR. In addition to its own computing chips, Alloy also packs a number of camera sensors that make it possible to use one’s own hands as controllers. Alloy is also capable of recognizing elements of the space around a user, which means that you’ll be able to play a game in your living room without inadvertently bumping into your coffee table. Intel has been developing this kind of sensor technology under the RealSense moniker for some time. However, Intel won’t be selling consumers Alloy headsets any time soon. The company is instead looking to open source the Alloy design next year, and allow third parties to build their own headsets based on Intel’s reference design. The company is also collaborating with Microsoft to bring some of its technology to Alloy-based headsets. Earlier this summer, Microsoft announced plans to bring the holographic technology that powers its own HoloLens headset to third-party devices. So why is Intel throwing its head in the VR ring if it doesn’t actually want to build its own consumer headsets? Because it wants other manufacturers to use its chips, and that’s currently far from certain. Related Daydream: How Google Is Tricking Us All to Embrace Virtual Reality High-end headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are already often powered by Intel, since the company’s chips are at the core of many gaming PCs. However, mobile VR headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR use phones to do the heavy lifting, and mobile has long been a sore spot for Intel, as most phones are powered by ARM chips. The future of virtual reality is still very much undecided: Will consumers flock to stationary, more capable but also more expensive headsets? Or will they instead embrace cheaper and less-capable mobile headsets? Google is betting on the latter, and introduced a new Android-based VR platform called Daydream earlier this year. The company has alliances with a series of handset makers, and first Daydream-capable phones are expected to launch later this year. For Intel, that’s a worrying trend. If handset makers dictate the future of VR, then it may find itself once again shut out of a massive opportunity. By introducing Alloy now, Intel essentially signals hardware makers that it is ready to be a part of the future of virtual reality headsets — even if the first Alloy-based headsets won’t ship any time soon.   Filed Under: Intel virtual reality Want to read more articles like this one?

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Deal with ARM would theoretically let Intel build 10nm iPhone and iPad chips By Christian Zibreg, Aug 16, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments Chip giant Intel announced today at its Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco an important deal with UK-based fabless semiconductor maker ARM Holdings that will permit other foundries to build chips based on ARM’s most advanced Cortex-series CPU cores using Intel’s sophisticated ten-nanometer process technology. Given that Apple’s in-house designed A-series chips include fully customized 64-bit CPU cores based on ARM technology, the announcement expands Apple’s options by letting its contract silicon manufacturers such as Samsung and TSMC fabricate iPhone and iPad chips using Intel’s foundry services. Intel also confirmed a deal with LG Electronics to fabricate chips for upcoming LG smartphones on Intel’s ten-nanometer FinFET process technology. Apple already has deals with TSMC and Samsung to produce upcoming A10 chips, with TSMC said to have already landed a deal to fabricate ten-nanometer A11 chips in 2017. Looking beyond 2017, Apple could easily give some of its chip business to Intel. The Cupertino company is known for pitting multiple suppliers against each other to keep price quotes down. Apple is also rumored to have ditched LTE modems from Qualcomm for those made by Intel across AT&T-bound iPhone 7 units. Each new iPhone generation has come with fewer and fewer chips as Apple continues to integrate even more functions into its own processors. With that in mind, it is entirely conceivable that a future iPhone chip might integrate an LTE modem, in which case the Intel-ARM deal could prove crucial for Apple. Intel’s foundry business lets third-party semiconductor makers access Intel’s technology and manufacturing assets through turnkey services including design, wafer manufacturing, packaging and testing. Today’s news is part of broader announcements made at the Intel Developer Forum, which kicked off with a keynote presentation today.

News & Analysis Intel Grabs ARM for 10nm Foundry Best density claimed in 10nm node Rick Merritt 8/16/2016 05:45 PM EDT 18 comments 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO – Intel revealed its 10nm process could outperform other foundries and will be used to make ARM-based mobile chips for companies including LG Electronics. To enable the move, Intel partnered with ARM’s Artisan division that is porting a reference design for one of its 64-bit cores to the process. The news at the annual Intel Developer Forum here reinforced the x86 giant’s continued strength in process technology. It also highlighted its need for a still-fledging foundry business to participate fully in the mobile market. Separately, China’s Spreadtum will make mobile chips in Intel’s current 14nm process. In addition, Intel’s 14nm Stratix 10 FPGAs will sample next quarter using a novel packaging technology that provides a lower cost than existing 2.5D techniques. The Intel 10nm node, still in a development stage, will sport a 54nm gate pitch. It’s the “tightest gate pitch any company will have in production for several years,” said Mark Bohr, a senior fellow in Intel’s manufacturing group. Intel said its 10nm process could have a two-year lead in transistor gate pitch. (Images: Intel) Bohr said both Intel’s 10nm and 7nm processes will continue the trend of delivering both denser chips and a lower cost per transistor. Although cost per wafer continues to rise with increasing numbers of steps and mask layers, “Moore’s law is alive and cost per transistor continues to come down at least for Intel,” he said. Intel’s two-and-a-half year old foundry business “had gone so quiet it looked like they were exiting it,” said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of market watcher VLSI Research Inc.  With the new deals, Intel is poised to make chips for ARM-based Android phones as well as the Internet of Things, “and a lot of the IoT will be based on ARM,” he said. Both Intel’s 14 and 10nm nodes are expected to deliver tighter logic area and lower transistor cost than historic trends. However, Bohr said the time between nodes will continue to be between two and two-and-a-half years given increasing wafer costs and complexity. “We are investing more effort in derivative technologies to make more use of these very expensive nodes and extend their life. Twenty years ago we would ramp up a node and two years later ramp it down again, Bohr said. Thus Intel has already started making its next-generation chips on a 14+ node it says will deliver 12% better performance. At the 10nm generation it expects to deliver 10+ and 10++ variants over time, Bohr said declining to provide details.

Ofc the cell area metric is valid, not disputing that.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Why so shy on metal pitch? OtisTD   8/23/2016 11:02:31 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate The reason Intel is using cell height instead of metal pitch is because they are not just doing straight dimensional scaling.  They are also reducing the number of fins per transistor in order to reduce the number of tracks in their design rule.  That way they get a smaller cell- and they want credit for that.  Some of the foundries used that trick as essentially their whole "density scaling" from 22nm to 16nm.  Intel did both from 22 to 14nm and appears to be doing both again from 14 to 10nm.  All of the basic concepts are related in this blog: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cmos-density-scaling-cppmxp-metric-ali-khakifirooz They are using fin depopulation to get functional scaling. So they want to use cell height to reflect that scaling, because the MX pitch doesn't capture it (which is why Witeken's math below doesn't hold because cell height is not the same as metal pitch).  I suspect they will come in with ~44nm min. metal pitch (43 is the historical projection), using double patterning, and they will use pitch quad (or SAQP) for the fins which will likely be close to 33-34nm pitch as well.  If you look purely at gatexmetal, then they don't get traditional 0.5x scaling- so that is why it looks a little different with the different metric. Not saying it's a good thing, it just is what it is.  Some people will hate it, but the foundries can't complain about it because they are selling the same story, only with less dimensional scaling underneath. The one thing even the most ardent Intel hater has to concede, unless of course they are just a shill, is that Intel has maintained their linear node scaling (gate pitch and metal pitch) through High K/Metal Gate and through FinFET introduction.  I don't think anybody else as done that.  See if it changes at 10nm, but I don't think so.

Their graph is cell height x gate pitch and it seems to claim the same kind of 0.46 scaling from 22nm to 14nm too. In 2014 their 14nm presentation was less fuzzy and the area scaling wasn't accelerated from 22nm to 14nm like the new graph suggests http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/foundry/mark-bohr-2014-idf-presentation.pdf Today's math might be a bit more creative than assumed.

ArF PQ would also be extendible to their 7nm node of course. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Why so shy on metal pitch? OtisTD   8/22/2016 3:57:37 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I'm not sure what the A9 can tell you about compactness as it's competitors have the same compactness because they are made in the same foundries.   Regarding metal pitch, the Samsung 10nm process (Cho VLSI 2016) has 64nm gate and 48nm M1/MX pitches respectively.  If you project Intel's 10nm based on their historical trend then you would get 54nm gate pitch (matching their announcement) and 43nm MX pitch.  Those are possible with double patterning, but the fin pitch projects to 33nm, which likely means SAQP.

Announced at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF), executive vice president for Windows and devices, Terry Myers, introduced the update, saying that "all Windows 10 devices will include a holographic shell," which is geared towards compatibility with Microsoft HoloLens and the just-announced Intel Project Alloy. READ: What is Intel Project Alloy? Windows 10 wants to position itself as the ultimate operating system platform for augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR), with headset compatibility opening up a new world of potential. As the Microsoft promotional video shows (below), there is scope to run both 2D and 3D applications at the same time in your new virtual office environment, aiming for a seamless transition between the two. But we'll have to wait until December this year to learn about the developer-side specification for such apps, while the consumer update itself won't roll out until 2017. Even by then, will such an update lure people to buy VR/AR/MR devices in the first instance? And will those people want to use such devices at all times when running Windows? We have our doubts.

UAVs Intel unveils a ready-to-fly drone, the Aero, to win over developers Posted Aug 16, 2016 by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Barnes & Noble drops its CEO after deeming him ‘not a good fit’ At the Intel Developer Forum on Tuesday, Intel unveiled a new, hardware product — a ready-to-fly drone; specifically, a quadcopter, aimed at software developers rather than casual hobbyists or commercial drone operators. Intel’s drone is a fully assembled unit that runs on Intel’s Aero Compute Board with a Linux operating system, RealSense for vision and comes with Santa Monica startup AirMap’s software development kit pre-loaded. AirMap, generally, helps drone users fly only where it’s safe and legal to do so. Other chip makers, like NVIDIA, Ambarella and Qualcomm, have been vying to gain market share in the burgeoning, if not yet clearly regulated, domestic and international drones market. But they’ve done so by selling their microprocessors to other hardware manufacturers, including companies that make UAVs or cameras and other systems that are integrated into them to enhance functionality, usually around filming and aerial data capture. Ambarella has supplied chips in the built-in cameras on DJI’s drones, and for GoPro cameras that can be mounted onto 3D Robotics drones, for example. And Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Flight platform and 4k cameras have been used in drones like the Tencent-Zerotech model called YING that sends data from mid-flight to Tencent’s social media platforms QQ and Wenxing. Intel is also an equity investor in drone tech startups, including: Yuneec, which makes drones that automatically avoid obstacles even in tight spaces; Airware, developers of an operating system for commercial drones; and PrecisionHawk, makers of a fixed-wing drone and software for agricultural and other commercial drones. Intel also acquired Ascending Technologies, a German autopilot tech company, in January of this year. The inclusion of AirMap’s software development kit in Intel’s Aero Ready-to-Fly quadcopters is a boon for the startup, which only launched this week at a closed conference for developers in Santa Monica, California. AirMap was already a partner of leading drone makers DJI, as well as 3D Robotics and Aeryon Labs. The startup’s CEO Ben Marcus told TechCrunch on Tuesday that AirMap is on a mission to “make drones a part of everyday life.” He said pervasive drone use can’t safely happen without an air space management system that covers the lower air space where drones fly, and relays that real-time information to drone operators, manufacturers and app developers about air space conditions. AirMap also makes data accessible in real time to other stakeholders like airports and regulators who need to know how and where drones are operating. The Aero Ready-to-Fly drone will be available to purchase by the end of this year, but Intel did not announce a firm on-sale date or price.

Where Project Alloy may rely on a full Core processor and graphics card inside its black and white body, Intel’s prototype WiGig VR headset leaves the heavy lifting to a separate PC as normal, but simply cuts the cord. It’s another use of WiGig, the wireless interconnect that Intel and others have been talking about for several years but which has struggled to make an impact. Right now, it’s only available in a few docking stations, allowing laptop users to connect to a display and other peripherals without plugging in USB or Thunderbolt. In fact, one of those was docks sacrificed in order to make Intel’s wireless VR prototype. It’s definitely an early attempt: the core is an Oculus DK2 developer headset, with a 3D printed shield that wraps around the front, and inside of which is mounted the guts of the docking station. At the other end, an Alienware gaming PC has been modified with a custom housing. Range is currently around five meters, the Intel engineers who have been working on the project explained to me. It’s not quite as straightforward as unplugging a monitor, keyboard, and mouse and plugging in an HDMI VR headset, however. The latency requirements of a docked laptop are very different to those of a gaming rig, and so custom firmware had to be written in order to streamline the link between the two. Right now, the channel which previously connected the display is handling VR video, while the backchannel for keyboard and mouse commands is used for other data like head positioning and such. In its current form, the WiGig 802.11ad link adds about 16ms delay on top of the usual wired connection. That, I’m told, doesn’t make for too terrible an experience – Intel has pushed it beyond the 75 fps target most VR titles aim for, and the system can easily handle 90 fps – and the engineers believe it can be cut further. Exactly where the project goes next remains to be seen. With what’s still a fairly limited range – the team described it to me as “wireless tethering” – it’s not so much a replacement to Project Alloy as it is an alternative approach. Future prototypes could well be a lot less bulky – most of the components in the customized headset aren’t needed, as they’re carried over wholesale from the donor dock – and refinements to the firmware will come in due course. Hopefully that means a little more stability, too, since the current hardware wasn’t playing ball so I couldn’t actually try it out myself. A companion project, meanwhile, has come up with a vest for VR gamers using the headset, with hot-swappable batteries. Right now, the current WiGig prototype hasn’t got anywhere close to testing battery life on its own. Nonetheless, the hope is that there’s sufficient interest that the project goes beyond the “interesting tinkering” stage. Given VR systems like HTC Vive and Oculus’ own Rift are still highly dependent on potent video cards, and Project Alloy is yet to demonstrate its own graphical talents, it seems like there could well be a market there.

Intel has a new concept for a wireless virtual reality headset Tech Insider 8/16/2016 Steve Kovach © Provided by Business Insider Inc intel project alloy virtual reality headset Intel, the company best known for making computer chips, is now exploring virtual reality. The company a concept device called Project Alloy, a wireless VR headset that unlike the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, doesn't need to be tethered to a computer to operate. Alloy is just a prototype now, and it's unlikely Intel will launch a standalone product. Instead, Intel is making Alloy an open hardware platform anyone can use to build VR headsets. It'll also work with Windows Holographic, the special version of Windows designed for augmented reality and VR. Intel has been in a tough spot in recent years as its core PC chip business . The company already whiffed on its chance to develop mobile processors for phones and tablets, and has started exploring other categories like drones and now VR.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich showed off the headset Tuesday at the start of the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. "Merged reality will be one of those fundamental shifts that is going to redefine how we work, how we are entertained and how we communicate," Krzanich said. Intel's RealSense technology is built into the all-in-one headset, allowing it to recognize where a person is at all times and what they're doing with their hands, which can act as controllers.

"It doesn't feel very virtual when you're tied to a confined space," Krzanich said. Intel's Craig Raymond displays the Project Alloy virtual reality headset during the Day 1 keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Aug. 16, 2016. Intel Corporation The merged reality concept was demonstrated with the person using a physical dollar bill to carve a virtual piece of gold spinning on a virtual pottery wheel. "Gaming is going to be amazing. Imagine you could turn your entire house into a level of a game, and you're not walking into walls because you have a camera element to it and you're actually using your hands not a VR controller," Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy told NBC News at the event. Project Alloy will be open source, allowing developers to first get their hands on the technology and create new experiences. Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices group, joined Krzanich onstage to announce Project Alloy will run on Windows Holographic, Microsoft's platform for its HoloLens mixed reality eyewear. Myerson said Windows Holographic would be released to mainstream Windows 10 devices next year. Myerson said the experience will bring a new experience for multitasking in mixed reality.

It's part of a push to let more people use what Microsoft calls mixed reality -- either bringing physical objects into virtual reality or overlaying digital objects on the physical world. Right now, Microsoft already covers that second area with its HoloLens hardware, but it's also working with a variety of hardware manufacturing partners like Intel to build new hardware that works with mixed reality.  [ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] The new capabilities will enable users with PC-powered VR headsets to interact with Windows 10 apps, mixed reality content, and virtual reality content all at once. That’s a major expansion of Windows Holographic, which is currently only available on the HoloLens. The move is a positive one for both companies, as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality all become increasingly popular, said analyst Patrick Moorhead. "Microsoft and Intel working together on mixed reality is a very positive sign and historically, more has been accomplished with the two working together than against each other," Moorhead said by email. "Intel and Microsoft were not aligned in smartphones or tablets, and the result was negative for both." The Windows Holographic announcement dovetailed with the news that Microsoft and Intel are working together on Project Alloy, a wireless headset that uses sensors to bring objects into VR from the real world. Intel will release an open-source set of specifications for building an Alloy headset and allow hardware makers to build their own.  As part of the news, Myerson showed off a simple Windows Holographic demo running on a US$600 Intel NUC mini computer. The demo, which ran at 90 frames per second, is an encouraging sign for people who don't have the powerful PCs needed to run the current crop of high-end VR headsets.  Microsoft will be outlining more details about its Windows Holographic strategy at the WinHEC conference in Shenzhen, China, this December.  To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.
