January 25 AAPL: 99.44 -1.98 Opinion: What can we expect from the 2016 MacBooks, rumored to be launched by June? Ben Lovejoy - 10 months ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro Mac MacBook MacBook Air Opinion Comments (89) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With KGI suggesting that we could see new MacBook models as early as the first half of the year, I thought it would be a good time to expand on the suggestions we made in our 2016 roundup and speculate in a little more detail on what we might expect from those machines. There is rather a lot of speculation involved, for a couple of reasons. First, while we tend to see a number of leaks and rumors for the iPhone – not least from our own Mark Gurman – there are notably fewer for Macs. We’ll likely see some nearer the time, but we could as yet still be six months out. Second, it’s easier to predict what Apple is likely to do with regard to the MacBook range than when it might do it. I’ve argued before that we can at some point expect Apple to drop the MacBook Air label, leaving two ranges known as the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. But whether that will happen this year or next is, I think, harder to guess. But let’s start with what we know about the technology available to Apple this time around … Apple currently uses a mix of Broadwell and Haswell processors in its MacBook Air/Pro range. This year, Intel will have 6th-gen Skylake chips available in time for a June launch. Skylake will offer a significant speed bump over current chips. We’re likely to see gains in the 10-20% range in the CPU, and rather better from the graphics, where improvements of up to 40% are possible. Skylake chips are also notably more power efficient than current-generation processors, offering power savings in the 15-30% range. Apple could use this improved efficiency to boost battery life, reduce battery size or a combination of the two. I’ll share my thoughts on this shortly. The latest kid on the block in terms of ports is of course the USB-C standard which Apple used in the 12-inch MacBook. Since then, Intel gave USB-C a new capability: incorporating Thunderbolt into the chip. Finally, Skylake incorporates a couple of new wireless communication standards, WiDi – Wireless Display – and WiGig, short-range high-speed wireless data of up to 7Gbps. Future versions of the chip will also support wireless charging, but those won’t be available in time for a June launch. These features may influence Apple’s decisions on future monitors and accessories (wireless Thunderbolt Display and external drives, for example), but won’t have any immediate impact on the machines themselves. So, that’s the technology Apple has to play with – what do I think it will do with it? Across the range Apple has to adopt Skylake: it would be silly to launch any new Mac without taking advantage of the sixth-generation Intel chips. For me, the only question here is whether the new MacBook Air gets a full-powered Skylake chip, or the much lower-powered Core M version. More on this when we look specifically at the Air. It’s also a no-brainer that Apple will add USB-C to both MacBook Air and MacBook Pro machines – and given that USB-C now incorporates Thunderbolt, Apple will undoubtedly drop the standalone Thunderbolt port. The only question here is whether Apple will retain any other legacy ports. There’s another piece of technology Apple has had for a while now but not yet added to the Mac: Touch ID. With many of us used to logging in to our iPhone and iPad with our fingerprint, it feels rather clunky to have to type a password when we login to our Macs. Apple first patented fingerprint login to Macs way back in 2007, but adding the hardware to MacBooks is not the only approach it could take. Apple could take a Continuity-style approach and allow us to use Touch ID on our iPhone to login to our Macs. There are already third-party apps that allows us to do this, so there’s no technical barrier to Apple going this route. But one way or the other – hardware or software – I think 2016 is the year Apple needs to allow us to use Touch ID on our Macs. This would not only allow fingerprint login, but would also be a far more convenient way to access the secure Notes facility introduced in OS X 10.11.4, and to add Apple Pay as a payment option on the apple.com website. Finally, I’d expect at least the Air – and possibly also the Pro – to mirror the color options of the 12-inch MacBook, offering a choice of silver, space gray and gold. Just my take. So now let’s talk specifics … 2016 MacBook Air/MacBook I’m going to go out on a limb here and suggest that this will be the year in which Apple drops the Air suffix, so I’m going to use the label MacBook for the machine currently known as the MacBook Air. It would be silly to launch a 12-inch machine only to retain an 11-inch one, so I think we can safely say that the 11-inch MacBook Air will not be replaced. We’ve also heard rumors of a 15-inch MacBook Air, which would give us 12-, 13- and 15-inch models. (My only question here would be whether there’s really a need for both 12- and 13-inch machines? Could Apple instead drop the 13-inch model?) If I’m right about the label, then we can expect the larger machine(s) to adopt the design of the 12-inch MacBook. This will, I suspect, include the single USB-C port (incorporating Thunderbolt). Which brings us back to the Skylake power efficiency question I posed earlier: will Apple boost the battery-life or reduce the battery size? At least where the MacBook range is concerned, I think it will reduce the size to match the much sleeker proportions of the 12-inch model. And, for good or bad, I think that also means we can expect Apple to use the ultra-low-profile butterfly keyboard on the 13- and 15-inch models. There is another messiness in the current MacBook/Air range: the 12-inch model has a Retina display, the current 11- and 13-inch machines don’t. That too needs to be tidied-up, and other manufacturers are using high-resolution displays in their ultrabooks, so I strongly suspect that we can expect Apple to use Retina screens across the entire range. The final question, then, is whether the MacBook range gets the full-fat Skylake processors I expect to see in the MacBook Pro, or the cut-down Core M version whose predecessor was used in the 12-inch machine. This is a very tricky one, as it really depends on how well the 12-inch machine has sold. If it appears to have a niche market only, then the larger machines will probably get the real deal when it comes to their Skylake processors. But if sales of the 12-inch machine have demonstrated that most non-pro buyers are all about the portability, and never mind the power, we could see Core M CPUs across the MacBook range – which would also serve as a strong differentiator between the MacBook and MacBook Pro ranges. 2016 MacBook Pro The 13-inch MacBook Pro currently has Intel’s Broadwell chipset, but the 15-inch has the previous-generation Haswell. The blame here may lay with Intel rather than Apple, but either way Apple definitely needs to set things right by ensuring the new machines get the new Skylake chips with beefier Iris Pro graphics to match. It would be nice to imagine that Apple would also double the entry-level RAM from the present 8/16GB (depending on model) to 16/32GB, but the company has not historically been generous with RAM, so I’m not expecting to see an increase here. SSDs have been falling dramatically in price, so it would also be pleasant to think Apple might bump standard storage capacity from 128/256/512GB on the 13-inch model to 256/512/1TB, with the 15-inch getting 512GB/1TB. But Apple’s thinking of late seems to be that our data should be in the cloud rather than on our machines, so I’m again not optimistic. Apple has form when it comes to getting well ahead of the curve where legacy technology is concerned, dropping first the floppy drive and later the optical drive well before any other mainstream manufacturer. It also didn’t hesitate to drop legacy ports from the 12-inch MacBook. The MacBook Pro is of course aimed at a different market – one where many users do connect a number of peripherals at any one time. For this reason, I definitely don’t expect it to go the same single-port route as the MacBook, but I do expect it to standardize on USB-C. I’ve already mentioned that there’s no longer any need for a separate Thunderbolt port now that USB-C incorporates it, and I suspect we can also wave goodbye to HDMI when either an adapter or AirPlay to Apple TV will do the job. To me, the only questions are whether the MBP retains any USB 3 ports and the SDXC card slot. Users with multiple USB 2/3 devices would undoubtedly by annoyed by Apple losing these ports, but I do suspect that after some initial grumbling at the need to buy and carry adapters, most of us would get over it. And with many of today’s cameras offering Wi-Fi connectivity, Apple could make a case for losing the card slot too. One strong possibility, then, would be to lose all ports bar the headphone socket, replacing them all with four or five USB-C ports and relying on adapters for everything else. I’d personally love to think that another differentiator between MacBook and MacBook Pro ranges would be battery-life. Use the improved power efficiency of the Skylake processors to deliver a sleeker form-factor in the MacBook via smaller batteries, but retain the battery sizing in the Pro to deliver longer battery-life. But once again, I’m not optimistic. I’d instead expect Apple to reduce the battery size in the MacBook Pro to deliver a slimmer, sleeker machine – perhaps partially borrowing the wedge shape of the MacBook range. I’ll end on a wildcard: with Apple having seemingly moved from the 11-inch MacBook Air to a 12-inch MacBook, there is the possibility of a move from 13- and 15-inch machines to 14- and 16-inch, without any increase in the overall dimensions. If Apple did that with the MacBook Pro only, it could further differentiate the ranges. As ever, please take our polls and share your own thoughts in the comments.

I’d instead expect to see the specs gap between Macbook and Air grow a little slimmer over the next few years. Specifically, I think Apple needs to prove it can produce a 12-inch Macbook in its current form without sacrificing so much performance. Also, I expect to see the 12-inch model get a price drop as it falls in line with the Air models’ price points. Perhaps in two or three years we’ll see the “Air” moniker dropped, but I think Apple i still working out the kinks to fit the Air guts in the non-air body.

It’s not 17″ but it gets closer and everybody’s 15″ bags will still accommodate if the chassis form factor is the same. I dislike the storage speculations. When you are crunching / saving / accessing big video and photo files, “The Cloud” is NOT a viable working solution. Perhaps WiFi and other internet access at the Apple Campus is 1 Gb/sec but in the real world (at least in the USA) the term “broadband” is deceptive advertising. For one asymmetrical upload / download speeds make uploading large files tedious if not unfeasible for working graphics professionals. SO, we end up carrying an external drive and it kind of gets away from the whole ‘Field Portable’ thing. Having said that 1 TB of internal storage seems to be adequate (for now) so I think it should be the ‘Minimum’ for the MPB. Minimum DDR should be pretty robust as well … 32 GB.

They will later be replaced completely by the MacBook range, when prices of Retina Displays and SSD will make it possible to get it into MacBook Air prices. The MacBook could gain a 14″, both with moderate power (to differenciate them from the Pro) but still very slim and long battery charge. So no Skylake for the MacBook. The MacBook Pro could loose the 13″ version, keep the 15″ and see the come back of a 17″ version. Form factor would only see minor changes expect making it a bit slimmer, probably by adopting the MacBook Keyboard and trackpad pad, and using same specialy formed batteries. Perhaps, as noticed, also in space-gray and gold. And of course Skylake and USB-C, one on each side. And Touch ID. Possibility for rationalizing the production, the Pro could have same “even” screen sizes logic as the MacBook. It would then be 14″, 16″ and 18″. I don’t see the use of a 12″ MacBook Pro. The current 13″ isn’t Pro anyway So we would have The MBA 11″ and 13″ unchanged for another year for cheap entry level. The MB with 12″ and 14″ for portability. Will replace the Air next year or so.

Then the most logical direction would be to realign the three ranges (MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro) as three sizes (12″, 14″ and 16″). I believe Apple will stick to the Skylake M processor to keep the 12″ fanless, light and thin, aimed at students, home users and travellers. It may ditch the 2.5mm audio jack (if the iPhone rumours are true) for another USB-C + Thunderbolt port (assuming the first port will also be upgraded to + Thunderbolt). Next, I think Apple will go full Skylake for the 14″ and 16″ models (rather than a 15″ model). The new 14″ with narrow bezels will be similar in size to the current 13″, and the 16″ will resemble a 15″. I think the 14″ will be aimed at office and business users, with 2 USB-C + Thunderbolt ports, whereas the 16″ will be a targeting pro users, filling the gap of the previous 17″ MacBook Pro, with 4 USB-C + Thunderbolt ports. Within each screen size, I expect three levels of processor speed, and three levels of SSD storage, respectively. This would then make it more or less similar to choosing an iPad. For this reason, they may (but probably won’t) call the three versions MacBook Mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. This massive simplification will allow for a much easier selection of MacBooks for the not so tech-savvy consumer.

Just to clarify this, Intel didn’t add this to USB-C, it added TB3 support (and USB 3.1 Gen 2, 10Gbps) to its Alpine Ridge I/O controller that outputs to USB-C. Intel is using the built-in Alt Mode support of USB-C to carry the TB3 data. Skylake CPU also does not mean TB3 is automatically included nor the Alpine Ridge controller, it’s a separate chipset. In fact, Apple could’ve use this controller with Broadwell Intel CPUs as well, there’s no mandate to use it with Skylake. USB-C is a connector standard. It has support for Alt-Mode, allowing the chipset developers to include other technologies via this mode. In this case, Intel has added TB3 to its Alpine Ridge controller to use this Alt Mode. So, in this article, you are referring to adding Intel’s Alpine Ridge controller to Macs and even possible for future iOS devices to have support for it, like iPad Pro. If Sony comes up with a 1tbps data protocol, it can add support for it in its own custom I/O controller that outputs to USB-C and use Alt Mode to carry the custom protocol. That doesn’t mean USB-C has gotten a new capability nor does it mean all USB-C ports would support this new protocol. Is the Alpine Ridge controller small and power efficient enough to include in the Macbook, no clue. However, these were the main reasons TB2 did not take off fast on PCs the last generation, the TB controller was too big and too power hungry. Alpine Ridge is smaller and more power efficient but not to the point it may be enough for the Macbook. May also be the reason iPad Pro does not have this.

LikeLike triankar - 10 months ago Reply Ben, regarding the Air you forgot to factor in one thing: cost. The absolutely cheapest Mac laptop runs at $899 (11″ MBA). The cheapest MacBook 12 is $1299. So, if Apple means to drop the Air models, its entry-level laptop will be nowhere near as affordable. Things I expect to happen: – MacBook 12 prices drop to (slightly) more reasonable levels overall – We see a 4GB/128GB MacBook 12 with a $999 price as the new entry-level Apple laptop – Air models get dropped or at least receive minimal attention (depending on how aggressive Apple wants to be about it) – rMBP loses some fat (hello, Jony), the Thunderbolt ports (easy one) and MagSafe (I’ll miss it), gains USB-C ports (no-brainer) and hopefully retains at least one USB-A port. It would be nice if they at least kept a microSD port, when these cards are the de facto standard out there, but that’s an easy “not happening”. An adapter it is, then – the replacement of the Apple Thunderbolt Display is announced. A 27 inch 5K display with all the much-awaited USB-C / USB-A / TB / Ethernet ports around the back. Firewire? Not really. Price jumps from $999 back to $1299 or thereabouts, just because they can – we start seeing official USB-C to Lightning cables and wall adapters. It’s about time (September at the latest). If the new rMBP is around 1300 grams (MBA-13 levels) and below, that’ll be very nice. It’s my only complaint with my current rMBP13. I also wouldn’t mind if the MB12 gained another USB-C port. I’d argue it’s still much-needed in 2016, but I don’t see it happening.

While it is true that more camera makers are supporting wireless photo transfers, these are for mostly small jpegs created for viewing on a phone, not the large jpegs and definitely not the raw files that are going to be processed. Nikon flat out tells you on their web site that large files are a problem to transfer wirelessly. Other makers do not allow for any transfers other than small jpegs for this reason. Even the upcoming 802.11ad standards do not allow for the bandwidth needed to handle those kinds of transfers. Say you are a photographer that uses their MBP on site to assess their progress and to show their clients a sample of what to expect, so you pull out the five or six 128GB or 256GB sdxc cards you have filled so far on your photo shoot. Trying to ‘wirelessly’ scroll through the samples will be a nightmare that will end you up with dead batteries in your equipment and a client that is annoyed because you wasted their time. Using the sdxc slot for quick large file transfer is as common as usb flash drives. These slots should stay.

You shouldn’t be leaving a $1500+ laptop laying around such that you need to enter a password if it falls asleep for a couple hours. Then when you have to enter the pw – you have a real keyboard to enter the pw in seconds.

The 13″ Macbook Air remains as the cheapest, entry level option. Not sure on processor or USB-C. I have a feeling it will stick around but not get the latest in terms of specs and hardware features. Similiar low-res screen, but maybe gets an IPS panel. If no hardware updates at all, 13″ might drop in price to whatever the 11″ sells for now. Maybe gets some zany new colors. 12″ Macbook will be updated with a new processor, touch ID and 1 additional USB-C port, and a 14″ Macbook will be introduced. Remember inches refers to the diagonal width of the screen, not the actual size of the laptop. The new Macbook’s bezel is so much thinner, a 14″ would be very close in size to the super popular 13″ MBA but with a new sexy, slightly larger screen. Then in a few years as the Macbook becomes commodified the MBA will go away or finally be replaced. I also think it’s totally possible the new Macbook line gets rebranded as Macbook Air 2 or just Macbook Air if the original goes away. This is their big bet for the near future of laptop computing. Once the Core M processors for it get up to snuff, and I think they are very close, this is going to be the laptop everyone wants.

With current technology it is easily doable – it all comes down to battery life (if skylake 30% more power efficient then a quad-core could probably be brought into the 13″ without affecting battery life more than 10%). — If it is just a secondary computer, then just updating the Macbook to Skylake would be fine. LikeLike Jerry Suppan - 9 months ago Reply Thanks for that pretty thorough analysis of what to expect. I think this is pretty much spot on as to what to expect. I would like to see a change in Apple’s overall stingy nature. Ports, memory, storage. Macbook – It would be a lot more appealing if there were minimally two (2) USB Type-C ports. One for charging and a second one to simultaneously be able to use an external peripheral without hanging a large and relatively heavy, clunky adapter or breakout box. Or perhaps to be able to use an external monitor closed lid and external storage. For this reason I still will not consider a Macbook (not to mention it’s power performance) Having said that, as an alternative, I could consider one as a replacement for any iPad (including iPad Pro) to preclude any more iPad purchases. Since it is obvious Apple will not converge OS-X and iOS any time soon, the Macbook could be a consideration in lieu of any iPad. An inexpensive ASUS ZenPad 8″ could be used for any sort of iPad type functionality someone might want. Apple could, and should converge their OSes, but won’t until the competition is doing it so well Apple has no choice but to follow suit to remain competitive. Thus, sooner or later it will have to evolve. Comparatively, Surface pro already offers a powerful (Core i7-based) full-fledge PC as well as it being a tablet. There is also a rumor Google might converge ChromeOS and Android into an Androidbook type of device. Macbook Pro – 16/32 Memory options are definitely in order, especially one is to do ‘heavy lifting’ productions like video edits, conversion, rendering, CAD/CAM, whatever. Also, I would like to see a 2TB option in addition to the 500GB/1TB options for internal storage. Both of these requests are technically doable. So again, it all depends will lighten up on stinginess or not. If we are to call this a ‘Pro’ machine, make it a pro machine with differentiating factors.

Which stock now has more upside potential from current prices? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 15, 2016 at 4:00PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) are very different chipmakers. Intel mainly sells CPUs for PCs and data centers, while TI produces cheaper analog and embedded chips for a wide variety of industries. Yet Intel has risen just 7% in 2016 -- underperforming the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index's 21% gain -- while TI outperformed the index with a 24% gain. Image source: Getty Images. Will Intel continue lagging behind as TI keeps rising? Or does Intel, as a contrarian play, now have more upside potential than Texas Instruments? To find that answer, we should examine why TI rallied and why Intel slipped behind over the past year. Why is Texas Instruments on fire? On the surface, TI's growth doesn't look very exciting. Its revenue fell 0.4% last year, due to headwinds in personal electronics and wireless infrastructure, but is expected to rise 0.5% this year on the growth of its industrial and automotive businesses. Earnings rose 9% last year and are expected to grow another 12% this year. However, the chipmaker has a strong track record of growing its margins. After abandoning the more competitive mobile application processor and baseband modem markets several years ago, TI pivoted toward the production of low-cost analog and embedded chips. Its recent production shift from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter wafers also reduced its chip production costs by about 40%. The long-term impact on TI's gross margin over the past five years is easy to see: Data by YCharts. Those rising margins generate stronger free cash flow, which has risen at a compound annual growth rate of 7% between 2004 and 2015. TI consistently returns around 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. It's reduced its total share count by 42% since 2004 and raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years. While TI's forward yield of 2.2% is lower than many other "mature tech" peers, its well-diversified business model, rising margins, and shareholder-friendly goals make it a fairly low-risk semiconductor play. Why is Intel in trouble? Intel's sales dipped 1% last year but are expected to rise 6% this year. Earnings rose less than 1% last year, but are expected to grow 11% this year. Five main factors throttled Intel's growth: weak PC sales, sluggish enterprise spending on data centers, falling prices of memory chips (which it sells through its non-volatile memory unit), poor progress in mobile chips, and its lackluster growth in the Internet of Things market. Intel's top- and bottom-line numbers aren't terrible -- they're just mediocre. Its client computing (PC/mobile) group revenue fell 3% annually last quarter, while its data center revenue rose just 5%. That data center growth figure, which was partly blamed on weak sales in China, disappointed many investors, as Intel previously claimed that the unit could post 15% annual growth between 2015 and 2019. Intel already controls about 99% of the data center chip market, making it tough for the business to continue growing if enterprise customers postpone chip upgrades. Meanwhile, rival chipmakers like Qualcomm, IBM, and NVIDIA are all looking for ways to dent Intel's market share with cheaper or more specialized server chips. Intel is trying to offset its weakness in PCs and data centers with sales of memory chips and IoT modules, but low margins in both markets have weighed down Intel's gross margins over the past year. Data by YCharts. Like TI, Intel is a fairly shareholder-friendly company. Over the past 12 months, it spent 23% of its free cash flow on buybacks and 40% on dividends. It's reduced its share count by 18% over the past decade, and it pays a forward yield of 2.8%. But unlike TI, Intel doesn't have a habit of raising its dividend every four quarters. Which chipmaker is a better buy today? Texas Instruments currently trades at 23 times earnings, which is higher than Intel's P/E of 18 and the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies. Analysts expect TI's earnings to grow 10% annually over the next five years, which gives it a five-year PEG ratio of 2.3. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered cheap, TI doesn't look undervalued relative to its long-term earnings growth potential. Intel is also expected to grow its annual earnings by 10% during that period, but its lower P/E ratio gives it a cheaper PEG ratio of 1.5. Based on those figures, Intel is the cheaper stock with a higher dividend. Therefore, while I believe TI is still a solid long-term investment for conservative investors, Intel looks like it has more upside potential from current prices. However, that growth will depend heavily on the recovery of the PC market, its ability to continue growing its data center business, recovering memory prices, and its expansions into adjacent markets.

That data center growth figure, which was partly blamed on weak sales in China, disappointed many investors, as Intel previously claimed that the unit could post 15% annual growth between 2015 and 2019. Intel already controls about 99% of the data center chip market, making it tough for the business to continue growing if enterprise customers postpone chip upgrades. Meanwhile, rival chipmakers like Qualcomm, IBM, and NVIDIA are all looking for ways to dent Intel's market share with cheaper or more specialized server chips. Intel is trying to offset its weakness in PCs and data centers with sales of memory chips and IoT modules, but low margins in both markets have weighed down Intel's gross margins over the past year. Data by YCharts. Like TI, Intel is a fairly shareholder-friendly company. Over the past 12 months, it spent 23% of its free cash flow on buybacks and 40% on dividends. It's reduced its share count by 18% over the past decade, and it pays a forward yield of 2.8%. But unlike TI, Intel doesn't have a habit of raising its dividend every four quarters. Which chipmaker is a better buy today? Texas Instruments currently trades at 23 times earnings, which is higher than Intel's P/E of 18 and the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies. Analysts expect TI's earnings to grow 10% annually over the next five years, which gives it a five-year PEG ratio of 2.3. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered cheap, TI doesn't look undervalued relative to its long-term earnings growth potential. Intel is also expected to grow its annual earnings by 10% during that period, but its lower P/E ratio gives it a cheaper PEG ratio of 1.5. Based on those figures, Intel is the cheaper stock with a higher dividend. Therefore, while I believe TI is still a solid long-term investment for conservative investors, Intel looks like it has more upside potential from current prices. However, that growth will depend heavily on the recovery of the PC market, its ability to continue growing its data center business, recovering memory prices, and its expansions into adjacent markets.

Big Blue boffin Jennifer Chu holds a Power CPU die (Source: IBM) 15 Oct 2016 at 07:42, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles Today the web was broken by countless hacked devices – your 60-second summary AMD is a rounding error on Intel's spreadsheet and that sucks for us all Intel stock falls on glum Q4 Google has gently increased pressure on Intel – its main source for data-center processors – by saying it is "looking forward" to using chips from IBM and other semiconductor rivals. The web advertising giant said it hopes to use a mix of "architectures within our cloud" in the future. Back in April, Google revealed it had ported its online services to Big Blue's Power processors, and that its toolchain could output code for Intel x86, IBM Power and 64-bit ARM cores at the flip of a command-line switch. As well as Power systems, Google is experimenting with ARM server-class chips and strives to be as platform agnostic as possible. The keyword here is experimenting: the vast majority of Google's production compute workloads right now run on Intel x86 processors. In fact, according to IDC, more than 95 per cent of the world's data center compute workloads run on Intel chips. Thus, to keep its supply options open, to keep Intel from price gouging it, and to evaluate competing hardware, Google test drives servers with non-x86 CPUs. It makes sense to widen your horizons. On Friday this week, Google stepped up from simply toying with gear from Intel's competitors to signaling it seriously hopes to deploy public cloud services powered by IBM Power chips. "We look forward to a future of heterogeneous architectures within our cloud," said John Zipfel, Google Cloud's technical program manager. This comes as Google shared draft blueprints for the Zaius P9 server: an OpenCAPI and Open-Compute-friendly box with an IBM Power9 scale-out microprocessor at its heart. That's the same Power9 the US government is using in its upcoming monster supercomputers. Google has worked with Rackspace, IBM and Ingrasys on the Zaius designs – you may recall that the Zaius concept was unveiled in April. The Zaius block diagram ... click to enlarge (Source: Google) OpenCAPI is the anyone-but-Intel interconnect fabric that emerged this week; the Zaius P9's OpenCAPI compatibility, and support for Nvidia's high-speed NVLink, further highlights Google's reluctance to be shackled to Intel. As well as supporting OpenCAPI, the Z9 has 16 channels of DDR4 memory, SATA and USB interfaces, gigabit Ethernet, BMC and serial access, and a bunch of PCIe gen-4 interfaces. It takes a 48V supply – a voltage level that apparently hits a sweet-spot for data center machines in terms of power and energy efficiency – and meets the Open Rack v2 standard. The blueprints will be submitted to the Open Compute Project (OCP) to evaluate and approve. Hyper-scale companies like Google and Facebook publish their server specifications so Asian hardware manufacturers can mass produce them on the cheap, relatively speaking. That way, cloud giants get to buy exactly what they want without having to negotiate deals with traditional server vendors like Hewlett Packard Enterprise. "We've shared these designs with the OCP community for feedback, and will submit them to the OCP Foundation later this year for review," explained Zipfel. "This is a draft specification of a preliminary, untested design, but we’re hoping that an early release will drive collaboration and discussion within the community." Aside from compute workloads, we understand Google uses customized Nvidia GPUs for its AI-powered Google Translate service, and no doubt in other platforms too alongside its machine-learning ASIC. It also uses a customized network controller with builtin intelligence to manage and access vast pools of cached information with low latency.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 14, 2016 at 8:23PM Image source: Intel.  For years now, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been boasting that its current 14-nanometer and upcoming 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technologies can be used to create more densely packed chips than competing technologies from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Increased chip density, Intel claims, allows for a lower cost per transistor, ultimately meaning that a denser technology can enable a chip with more features than the same chip built on a less-dense technology for the same cost, or the same chip built more cheaply.  Indeed, Intel claimed at a presentation earlier this year that its 10-nanometer manufacturing technology offers "close to a full generation lead in logic density" compared to competing 10-nanometer technologies. I don't disbelieve Intel's claims comparing its 10-nanometer technology to competing 10-nanometer technologies. It does appear that the company's 10-nanometer technology can deliver significantly smaller chip areas than competing 10-nanometer technologies. However, Intel has completely ignored, at least in its public messaging, the fact that its 10-nanometer technology will be going up against TSMC's 7-nanometer technology, not TSMC's 10-nanometer technology. As luck would have it, TSMC recently disclosed a key piece of information about its 7-nanometer technology that essentially proves that Intel's lead in chip density is more or less a thing of the past. TSMC's 7-nanometer SRAM cell One helpful way to compare the relative densities of two processes is to build a similar structure -- often, a type of memory known as an SRAM. Intel disclosed a while back that a high-density SRAM cell in its 14-nanometer manufacturing technology measures in at 0.0499 square micrometers. This was significantly better than what TSMC was able to achieve with its 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer technologies. Recently, however, TSMC disclosed that a high-density SRAM cell implemented in its 7-nanometer manufacturing technology measures in at just 0.027 square micrometers -- nearly half of the size of the comparable structure implemented in Intel's 14-nanometer technology. In order for Intel's 10-nanometer technology to simply achieve parity with what TSMC is delivering with its 7-nanometer technology, it will need to shrink its high-density SRAM cell by a factor of 0.541 times. Scaling beyond that should put it in the lead. Intel's 10-nanometer should be roughly as dense as TSMC's 7-nanometer tech If we look at the last couple of generations of high-density SRAM cell scaling between successive Intel processes, we see that a scaling factor of approximately 0.54 times is essentially the norm: Intel Mfg. Tech  High Density SRAM Cell Size (square micrometers) Scaling from previous 45nm 0.346 0.608x 32nm 0.171 .494x 22nm 0.092 0.538x 14nm 0.0499 0.541x Source: Intel. At 45nm, Intel's SRAM cell scaling was quite poor, but at 32nm, it delivered a very good shrink. At the 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer generations, it delivered reasonable, but less than 0.5 times, shrinks. As long as Intel hits a similar shrink factor to what it achieved with its 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer processes, then its 10-nanometer technology should be competitive on SRAM cell size/gate density to TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. What Intel won't be able to claim is a "full generation lead" over TSMC as it had previously been able to do The new reality for Intel As a result of the delays that the company saw with its 14-nanometer and subsequent 10-nanometer technologies, Intel has managed to take what was a roughly two-year leadership position in chip area and essentially fall to parity with TSMC. To make matters worse, there's no real way for Intel to regain a leadership position here, especially not on the path that the chipmaker is currently on. TSMC is now, for all intents and purposes, "caught up" with Intel in terms of chip density. From its public statements, it plans to continue to scale down its chip area every two years. Intel, on the other hand, says that it plans to use its 10-nanometer technology for three full generations -- though it will improve the transistor performance with each generation. This means that, at best, Intel is merely keeping pace with TSMC in terms of area scaling. Business implications From a business perspective, this lack of clear chip-area leadership will probably impact its contract chip manufacturing efforts the most. Intel says it's interested in targeting two key areas with said efforts -- mobile devices and networking infrastructure. Should Intel not manage to fumble its transistor performance lead as it did its chip area lead, then its technologies may still be attractive to customers willing to pay for additional performance in networking infrastructure.  However, given how valuable chip area/density is in the majority of mobile applications, particularly as they are so cost sensitive, a lack of leadership on this metric may make it unattractive for potential customers to leave a proven supplier (e.g. TSMC) for an unproven player like Intel.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 14, 2016 at 8:23PM Image source: Intel.  For years now, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been boasting that its current 14-nanometer and upcoming 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technologies can be used to create more densely packed chips than competing technologies from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Increased chip density, Intel claims, allows for a lower cost per transistor, ultimately meaning that a denser technology can enable a chip with more features than the same chip built on a less-dense technology for the same cost, or the same chip built more cheaply.  Indeed, Intel claimed at a presentation earlier this year that its 10-nanometer manufacturing technology offers "close to a full generation lead in logic density" compared to competing 10-nanometer technologies. I don't disbelieve Intel's claims comparing its 10-nanometer technology to competing 10-nanometer technologies. It does appear that the company's 10-nanometer technology can deliver significantly smaller chip areas than competing 10-nanometer technologies. However, Intel has completely ignored, at least in its public messaging, the fact that its 10-nanometer technology will be going up against TSMC's 7-nanometer technology, not TSMC's 10-nanometer technology. As luck would have it, TSMC recently disclosed a key piece of information about its 7-nanometer technology that essentially proves that Intel's lead in chip density is more or less a thing of the past. TSMC's 7-nanometer SRAM cell One helpful way to compare the relative densities of two processes is to build a similar structure -- often, a type of memory known as an SRAM. Intel disclosed a while back that a high-density SRAM cell in its 14-nanometer manufacturing technology measures in at 0.0499 square micrometers. This was significantly better than what TSMC was able to achieve with its 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer technologies. Recently, however, TSMC disclosed that a high-density SRAM cell implemented in its 7-nanometer manufacturing technology measures in at just 0.027 square micrometers -- nearly half of the size of the comparable structure implemented in Intel's 14-nanometer technology. In order for Intel's 10-nanometer technology to simply achieve parity with what TSMC is delivering with its 7-nanometer technology, it will need to shrink its high-density SRAM cell by a factor of 0.541 times. Scaling beyond that should put it in the lead. Intel's 10-nanometer should be roughly as dense as TSMC's 7-nanometer tech If we look at the last couple of generations of high-density SRAM cell scaling between successive Intel processes, we see that a scaling factor of approximately 0.54 times is essentially the norm: Intel Mfg. Tech  High Density SRAM Cell Size (square micrometers) Scaling from previous 45nm 0.346 0.608x 32nm 0.171 .494x 22nm 0.092 0.538x 14nm 0.0499 0.541x Source: Intel. At 45nm, Intel's SRAM cell scaling was quite poor, but at 32nm, it delivered a very good shrink. At the 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer generations, it delivered reasonable, but less than 0.5 times, shrinks. As long as Intel hits a similar shrink factor to what it achieved with its 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer processes, then its 10-nanometer technology should be competitive on SRAM cell size/gate density to TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. What Intel won't be able to claim is a "full generation lead" over TSMC as it had previously been able to do The new reality for Intel As a result of the delays that the company saw with its 14-nanometer and subsequent 10-nanometer technologies, Intel has managed to take what was a roughly two-year leadership position in chip area and essentially fall to parity with TSMC. To make matters worse, there's no real way for Intel to regain a leadership position here, especially not on the path that the chipmaker is currently on. TSMC is now, for all intents and purposes, "caught up" with Intel in terms of chip density. From its public statements, it plans to continue to scale down its chip area every two years. Intel, on the other hand, says that it plans to use its 10-nanometer technology for three full generations -- though it will improve the transistor performance with each generation. This means that, at best, Intel is merely keeping pace with TSMC in terms of area scaling. Business implications From a business perspective, this lack of clear chip-area leadership will probably impact its contract chip manufacturing efforts the most. Intel says it's interested in targeting two key areas with said efforts -- mobile devices and networking infrastructure. Should Intel not manage to fumble its transistor performance lead as it did its chip area lead, then its technologies may still be attractive to customers willing to pay for additional performance in networking infrastructure.  However, given how valuable chip area/density is in the majority of mobile applications, particularly as they are so cost sensitive, a lack of leadership on this metric may make it unattractive for potential customers to leave a proven supplier (e.g. TSMC) for an unproven player like Intel.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface represents, the consortium says, a data-centric approach, and "provides an open, high-speed pathway for different types of technology – advanced memory, accelerators, networking and storage – to more tightly integrate their functions within servers." It "puts the compute power closer to the data, removes inefficiencies in traditional system architectures to help eliminate system bottlenecks and can significantly improve server performance," according to the consortium. The design specification is "built to minimize the complexity of high-performance accelerator design. Capable of 25Gbits per second data rate, OpenCAPI outperforms the current PCIe specification, which offers a maximum data transfer rate of 16Gbits per second." The consortium's announcement release declares: "Many technology companies have developed innovative solutions that today's data center technology cannot effectively leverage due to limited legacy interfaces. New technologies such as storage class memory and accelerators to support emerging workloads do not fit well on existing interfaces and a closed, proprietary approach does not allow for full industry participation nor innovation." OpenCAPI was founded by AMD, Google, IBM, Mellanox Technologies, and Micron. Other members include Dell EMC, HPE, Nvidia and Xilinx. Several members have product/tech introductions coming: IBM plans to introduce Power9-based servers that leverage the OpenCAPI specification in the second half of 2017. IBM will enable members of OpenPOWER Foundation to introduce OpenCAPI-enabled products in the second half 2017. Google and Rackspace's new Zaius server under development, announced at the OpenPOWER Summit in San Jose, will leverage Power9 processor technology and plans to provide the OpenCAPI interface in its design. Mellanox plans to enable the new specification capabilities in its future products. Xilinx plans to support OpenCAPI-enabled FPGAs. So it's mostly a Power9-driven effort currently. The OpenCAPI consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification fully available to the public at no charge before the end of the year. Find out about this and membership details at opencapi.org. Oh, and the supplier of the vast majority of server CPUs, Intel, is not a member. It's welcome to join though, the consortium says. Background The background includes the point that Intel bought FGA supplier Altera for $16.7bn in December 2015, and has its own QPI (Quick Path Interconnect) technology, not to mention Silicon photonics. It seems to us that OpenCAPI overlaps with the Gen-Z Consortium open memory fabric initiative. Both address the memory/storage-class memory interconnect area. Gen-Z aims to provide a direct-attach, switched or fabric topology – a flexible, high-performance memory semantic fabric – to interconnect Compute (SoC memory), FPGA and GPU accelerators, pooled memory, and network/storage IO links. OpenCAPI is meant to allow any microprocessor to attach to coherent user-level accelerators and I/O devices, and advanced memories accessible via read/write or user-level DMA semantics. Then there is the CCIX (Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators) group formed by AMD, ARM, Huawei, IBM, Mellanox, Qualcomm, and Xilinx (but not Nvidia or Intel) in May, to devise and make a cache coherent interconnect fabric linking multiple suppliers' CPUs, accelerators – FPGAs and GPUs – and network adapters so they can exchange data and share main memory. Why are there three such overlapping efforts? The simple answer is that none of the members of these consortia want to let Intel own the CPU-memory-accelerator-network interface technology and so grab an even higher percentage of customer spend on servers, plus favor its own CPU and FPGA efforts. They each and all think that the PCI interface is too slow and a higher-speed, lower-latency interconnect scheme is needed to let faster processors talk to faster accelerators, DRAM and the various storage-class memories emerging (think XPoint-type stuff), and RDMA-accessed external arrays. Gen-Z consortium members are AMD, ARM, Broadcom, Cavium Inc, Cray, Dell EMC, HPE, Huawei, IBM, IDT, Lenovo, Mellanox, Micron, Microsemi, Red Hat, Samsung, Seagate, SK Hynix, Western Digital Corporation and Xilinx. Google and Nvidia are the only OpenCAPI members not in the Gen-Z consortium. Support for OpenCAPI OpenCAPI declares: "Backed by a total of more than 30 leading technology companies, the three organizations welcome each other's announcements as part of a collaborative industry effort to create an open data center architecture for the future." As an example of vendor support, here's Tom Eby, VP and GM of Micron's compute and networking business: "Because open standards present the best opportunity for rapid innovation, the OpenCAPI, Gen-Z, and CCIX consortiums are an important step in ensuring that developing architectures can quickly adapt to capitalize on the dramatic benefits provided by new memory technologies." Here's Gaurav Singh, CCIX Chair: "The CCIX group of companies believe in the need to foster innovation in the industry. We welcome the efforts of and look forward to collaborating with the Gen-Z and OpenCAPI consortiums, which will further the development of key technologies that will define the data centers of tomorrow." Completing the fulsome threesome's joint supportive comments is Kurtis Bowman, Gen-Z Consortium president: "The Gen-Z Consortium is committed to establishing an ecosystem where members, the broader industry, and customers work together to deliver robust, high-quality specifications that enable new data center architectures. The formation of these three new consortia (CCIX, OpenCAPI, and Gen-Z), backed by more than 30 industry-leading global companies, supports the premise that the data center of the future will require open standards. We look forward to collaborating with CCIX and OpenCAPI as this new ecosystem takes shape." Reg Comment Key customers for any non-proprietary alternative to Intel fabric interconnect technology are: The server and hyperscaler suppliers: Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HDS, HPE, Huawei, IBM, InSpur, Lenovo, Oracle, Quanta and Supermicro on the server side. Businesses like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft on the hyperscale data center side. End users will basically buy what the server vendors adopt. The three consortia, in a crude view, represent overlapping anti-Intel groups, wanting to constrain and limit chipzilla's ability to grab more of the server silicon component market to itself. It would be more hopeful for them if they could combine in a single CCIX, OpenCAPI, Gen-Z organization, but the individual members' concerns and technology preferences would make such an attempt unwieldy and difficult to bring to a successful conclusion. Hopefully, and nonetheless, they will try anyway. Intel would rather face, we're sure, three partly or ill-coordinated and overlapping groups that collectively confuse interconnect-buying customers, and contrast the trios's confusing messages and timescales with its own, hopefully clearer and simpler message.

IBM has published a significant amount of detailed POWER8 design and software documentation: POWER Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) v2.07 POWER8 Processor User’s Manual for the Single-Chip Module IBM’s OpenPOWER Connect portal (free account creation required) OpenPOWER Foundation Raptor Engineering (a partner of Raptor Computing Systems) is a member of the OpenPOWER Foundation, an open technical membership organization dedicated to the POWER architecture. A World Beyond x86 The x86 architecture, while ubiquitous in personal computing, suffers from irreparable security and lockdown issues. For example, the Intel Management Engine (ME) is a problem that’s been brewing for about ten years, even though the popular technology press has only recently started reporting on it. The Intel ME is present on all modern Intel processors and is essentially a backdoor with full access to the entire computer - a security disaster waiting to happen. Due to the deeply entrenched interests of current players (e.g., Intel and AMD), and the presumed jungle of legally binding contracts those interests have with their myriad partners, this situation will never improve and will only worsen. The video below goes into detail about why Talos is a great alternative to x86. (This presentation was first given at the Coreboot conference and developer meeting in San Francisco, June 2016.) Comparisons & Benchmarks AnandTech recently did an extensive comparison of IBM’s POWER8 processor with Intel’s Xeon E5. This quote from the conclusion highlights the strength of the POWER8 processor: The POWER8 microarchitecture is clearly built to run at least two threads. On average, two threads gives a massive 43% performance boost, with further peaks of up to 84%. This is in sharp contrast with Intel’s SMT, which delivers a 18% performance boost with peaks of up to 32%. Taken further, SMT-4 on the POWER8 chip outright doubles its performance compared to single threaded situations in many of the SPEC CPU subtests. All in all, the maximum throughput of one POWER8 core is about 43% faster than a similar Broadwell-based Xeon E5 v4. Considering that using more cores hardly ever results in perfect scaling, a POWER8 CPU should be able to keep up with a Xeon with 40 to 60% more cores. Benchmarks and graphs in the remainder of this section are provided as-is for general reference only, and are copyright Raptor Engineering 2016. High-level Comparison of Machine Architectures Values are approximate and for illustration purposes only. The State of General Purpose Computing Where does Talos™ fit within the larger spectrum of general purpose computers? Talos™ is the only powerful, auditable machine available in a standard ATX workstation / server form factor. Nothing else comes close. While certain ARM SoCs are relatively open and libre-friendly, their performance leaves much to be desired. Most of these ARM SoCs cannot even compete against x86 hardware from the late 2000s on a raw performance or performance per watt basis. However, they are inexpensive and in some cases suitable for light web browsing or other non-intensive tasks. On the x86 end, all currently available hardware has been effectively “TiVoized” through vendor- and manufacturer-signed binaries, and can never be audited or modified by the machine owner. Multiple scandals have come to light over the past year involving the manufacturer abusing this position of power to install various forms of malware through a hostile firmware image. In many cases the only recourse was to stop using the computer entirely until the manufacturer released a new firmware version with the malware ostensibly removed. This tradeoff of inexpensive machines for loss of owner control over said machines is unacceptable for many users in the current age of diminishing privacy and increasingly damaging cyberattacks. Even machines ostensibly built for security are impacted by this situation. For example, the ORWL listed in the table below may have excellent hardware security features, but the software and firmware stack running on its x86 processor is completely unauditable, has full machine control even after operating system launch, and may not be trustworthy. Why would a criminal even bother attacking such a machine physically when a remote wireless or Internet-based exploit would be not only more cost effective but virtually untraceable? Talos™ does not allow such malware or bugs to hide undetected in the most privileged and sensitive areas of your system, namely the firmware and kernel, nor does it ask you to give up modern, high-end general purpose compute performance in the name of security.

These applications are using the full 3D hardware capabilities of the host POWER8 machine, and have access to the host’s ALSA audio. Applications that primarily use scalar instructions perform quite well, while applications making heavy use of vector instructions experience lag and stuttering due to missing features in QEMU (see notes below). Multiple 3D games were used to demonstrate the feasibility of a non-native engine binary interfacing with the POWER8 host GPU. At the end of the video, several applications are re-launched using native ppc64el builds for a performance comparison. Notes: Video captured straight from Radeon DVI output. ALSA audio functions also, but was not captured for this demonstration. This QEMU patch series is required, and was applied to the QEMU master version used in this demonstration. Stuttering is largely caused by QEMU not translating target SIMD / vector instructions to host SIMD / vector instructions. QEMU currently translates each vector instruction (e.g. from SSE/SSE2/AVX/NEON/AltiVec) to large chunks of scalar code, resulting in very slow vector execution. This currently affects all target / host pairs available in QEMU, not just the OpenPOWER / x86 combination. The QEMU project is seeking volunteers to implement SIMD / vector translation, so if you would like to help out please contact the developers! setreuid() / setegid() calls from target binaries currently crash QEMU. Alien Arena was recompiled for x86 with those two calls commented out for this demonstration. Tested using POWER8 with a single AMD Radeon R290X and the open Radeon driver. Host kernel must be compiled with 4k page support to match the x86_64 architecture-defined page size. DRM passthrough requires that the QEMU host process LP mode match the target LP mode; i.e. i386 targets would require a 32-bit build of QEMU. Because OpenPOWER™ ships with a stock 64-bit kernel and userspace, i386 targets have not been tested. Unreal® Engine 4 on OpenPOWER™ The following video illustrates the power of Talos™ to accelerate game development. Talos™ allows you to keep your valuable assets and proprietary engine code safe and secure through full owner control, while outperforming similarly priced systems running on the x86 and ARM architectures. Talos™’ massive RAM and GPU bandwidth reduce both compile and asset cook times which frees developers to focus on improving the design and gameplay of their next AAA title. Notes: Radeon 290X used with Mesa 12 in OpenGL 4.3 mode on Debian Strech (LLVM 3.9). Flickering directional lights are a general bug in the Unreal® Engine OpenGL backend; this issue is present on all architectures and has been reported to Epic Games. Editor load time is similar to load time experienced on the x86 architecture using Linux. Video recorded directly from R290X output at 1920x1080 60FPS using 5.1 HDMI audio. Several minor dropouts are present in the video due to the extreme bandwidth of the source stream. These dropouts are an artifact of the recording process used and are not visible during gameplay. This Unreal® Engine 4 patch series is required (agreement with Epic Games required for private access), and was applied to the Unreal® Engine 4 master version used in this demonstration. This Unreal Tournament™ patch series is required (agreement with Epic Games required for private access), and was applied to the Unreal Tournament™ master version used in this demonstration. This Radeon driver patch is required, and was applied to the radeon driver used in this demonstration. Building a Complete Talos™ System You’ll need the following components to build out a complete Talos™ system. CPU If you don’t already have one, you can add a POWER8 CPU to your order. We currently offer 8-, 10-, and 12-core options. RAM While a full RAM hardware compatibility list (HCL) is not yet available, we can recommend Hynix 16GB x4 ECC RDIMMs operating at DDR3 PC-12800 speeds. GPU Although an integrated display driver comes with the Talos™ mainboard, you can also install a discrete GPU of your choosing. We recommend any NVIDIA GK104-based card, which is a reasonably modern GPU that can be initialized by and used with the libre Nouveau driver. Should a discrete GPU be installed, the integrated display driver can either be safely disabled or used as a secondary display output, contingent on software support. Enclosure A good choice for an enclosure is the Super Micro Computer SC747TG-R1400B-SQ. Development Process Our firmware and software development system for OpenPOWER uses a two-socket reference server from IBM codenamed “Firestone.” This allows us to directly verify functionality, check performance, and develop / port new software to Talos™ machines even before Talos™ prototypes have been manufactured. The following images show our test setup. Angled view of the internals of the Firestone server used for Talos™ prototyping Top view of the internals of the Firestone server used for Talos™ prototyping To configure Firestone emulation of Talos™, we pull all cards and disable the secondary CPU package, then we install two memory buffer cards on CP0 and add in PCIe cards containing the new peripherals present on Talos™. While the resultant configuration is not exactly the same as a Talos™ system, and in fact from a pure hardware perspective is quite different, from a performance and software view it is nearly indistinguishable. This configuration is what we use to patch the kernel, modify the OpenPOWER firmware, and gather benchmarks for the Talos™ machines. Manufacturing Plan We are in the process of converting the Talos™ designs into the requisite PCB layout. During this process, firmware development is occurring in parallel. Once these two processes are complete, initial bringup will commence, followed by full testing and requisite minor modifications before release for manufacture. We have many years of experience in all aspects of electrical and software engineering, spanning board level layout through high level application development, without any gaps. As a result, we fully understand each and every part of our designs, the interactions between those parts, and are uniquely situated to handle large, complex projects requiring each component to mesh neatly with the surrounding components, whether those components be hardware, firmware, or software. Our design philosophy is to do it right the first time, and we take explicit steps to ensure that the resultant product will operate in a wide range of adverse conditions. For this particular project we also have the backing of our major silicon vendors, who are willing to work with us to ensure that their devices are used correctly and to their maximum potential. Risks & Challenges What could go wrong? With a project of this complexity, there are numerous potential failure points. Raptor Engineering has significant experience in board level design and system bringup, so we have anticipated and handled the most likely points of failure. That being said, certain unknowns still remain: Board space! Cramming a high-performance POWER8 processor and its support circuitry onto a densely populated ATX board means there is zero physical margin in many areas. While we are fairly confident that the board can be routed as depicted, there is still the off chance that some changes to the list of Talos™ peripherals may need to be made during the routing phase. The open toolchain for the FPGAs, while apparently stable, has not been tested to the same degree as most commercial offerings. Any number of issues could crop up during bringup of the FPGA section as a result of the toolchain – our fallback plan would involve developing the FPGA HDL using the proprietary software and assisting the open toolchain project(s) where feasible after Talos™ has shipped. DDR3 / PCIe routing / signal integrity issues. Even when design guidelines are rigorously followed, there is always the chance that signal integrity will be compromised somewhere due to nearby signals and components. If this occurs, the fault will need to be isolated and repaired in the prototyping stage. System firmware. Current offerings from IBM require the machine owner follow strict guidelines for memory population and related hardware configuration. It is likely that bugs in the IBM firmware will be discovered once these rules are no longer enforced. Linux drivers. While overall the switch to little endian has ensured the vast majority of existing Linux drivers function normally on Talos™, there is still the potential for various bugs in these drivers to appear in the final system configuration. Ordering & Payment Crowd Supply can accept a wide array of payment options, though credit card is the easiest way to place an order. Because this is a crowdfunding campaign, any order you place for a Talos™ system using a credit card will not actually be charged until the campaign reaches the funding goal ($3.7M USD). If we don’t reach that goal, no credit cards will be charged and orders paid by means other than credit card will be refunded. For some product options, you will need to add a POWER8 processor as a separate line item to your order (or order it separately later). These processors are in “pre-order” mode, which means you will be charged for them right away. However, if the campaign does not meet the funding goal, all pre-orders of POWER8 CPUs will be fully refunded. Why are the CPUs Sold Separately? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is a little complicated. Basically, it has to do with the complexities of crowdfunding and ensuring that we’re doing all we can to protect backers. Generally speaking, the CPUs are offered separately from the mainboards in order to ensure that the campaign’s funding goal is accurate. While the funding goal is a dollar amount ($3.7M), it is based on a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of Talos mainboards, 900 units. The problem is that basing a campaign on an MOQ is impractical for a number of reasons. For example, backers are unaccustomed to such campaigns, there’s no way to account for support-only pledges, and different components that go into the product can have different MOQs. Given this reality, the wide price range of CPUs (from $0 if a CPU isn’t wanted, up to $3350 for a 12-core CPU) means it would be basically impossible to accurately or meaningfully set a funding goal. For example, if no one bought a CPU, the goal would be 900 x $4100 = $3.7M. On the other hand, if everyone bought a 12-core CPU, then the funding goal would need to be 900 x ($4100 + $3350) =$6.7M. Because we can’t possibly predict the demand for each CPU, we therefore need to sell them separately from the mainboards. You’ll also note that the CPUs are sold in “pre-order” mode as opposed to “crowdfunding” mode, which means your card is charged as soon as the order is placed. That’s because, unlike the mainboards, there is no strict MOQ to meet before they can be manufactured. As with all pre-orders on Crowd Supply, you can cancel and get a full refund at any time. As we note on the CPU page, if the Talos campaign fails to meet its funding goal, all CPU orders will be promptly canceled and refunded in full. On one hand, this is all a little cumbersome and confusing. On the other hand, it allows you to spread out the cost of purchase over a longer time by giving you the option of purchasing the CPU later. The bottom line is that these processes are in place to best protect backers while maximizing the potential for a successful campaign.

Advanced Micro Devices officials said Chinese internet giant Alibaba will use the company's graphics technologies in its cloud computing efforts, a significant win for the chip maker as it looks to re-establish itself in the data center against larger rivals Intel and Nvidia. AMD President and CEO Lisa Su and Simon Hu, president of Alibaba's cloud computing unit, announced the partnership Oct. 14 during the Alibaba Computing Conference in China. According to AMD officials, Alibaba will use AMD's Radeon Pro graphics cards in its global cloud data center as part of an effort to expand its cloud offerings and drive adoption of its cloud-based services. Graphics has been a key component of AMD executives' larger strategy to grow the company and return it to sustainable profitability. GPUs enable the company to compete in a broad range of growth areas in the industry, including gaming, immersive computing and virtual reality (VR). In addition, GPUs increasingly are used as CPU accelerators in the data center for enterprises, supercomputer and high-performance computing (HPC) environments, increasing the performance of systems while reining in power consumption. The chip maker created the Radeon Technology Group (RTG) for its GPU efforts and over the past year has unveiled a range of new GPUs, introduced new technologies to the chips like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, rolled out Radeon Software Crimson to replace its Catalyst Control Center and compete with Nvidia's GeForce Experience software, and introduced the Boltzmann Initiative (a project designed to make it easier to develop high-performance computing applications for the FirePro graphics technology). Most recently, AMD has introduced a growing portfolio of GPUs based on its new Polaris architecture, a 14-nanomter 3D FinFET transistor design that helps the chips more than double the performance-per-watt of previous Radeon graphics technologies. Officials also have begun talking about the company's next-generation GPU architecture, dubbed "Vega." AMD CEO Su in a statement said a collaboration like that with Alibaba Cloud "helps ensure the investments AMD is making in our high-performance graphics and computing data center products continue to align with the needs of the broader cloud market." During Alibaba's show in China, the companies demonstrated an Alibaba Cloud solution featuring AMD's Radeon Pro server GPUs. The chip maker is targeting the data center as another growth area. More than a decade ago, AMD made inroads into the space against Intel with the launch of its Opteron processors, enabling it to grab almost a quarter of the worldwide server chip space. However, Intel, with all of its financial and engineering resources, and missteps by AMD, conspired to knock that market share down, and now more than 95 percent of all servers run on Intel processors. However, an array of companies—not only AMD, but also ARM with its low-power architecture and IBM with its Power chips and OpenPower efforts—are looking to grab some of the market, positioning themselves in the industry as the best alternative to Intel. AMD is looking to compete against Intel with its upcoming "Zen" microarchitecture, systems powered by Zen-based "Naples" chips shipping in the second quarter 2017. At the same time, AMD officials want to challenge GPU giant Nvidia with the company's Radeon processors. The company apparently is beginning to make inroads. Jon Peddie Research analysts said in a recent report that AMD saw a bump in its market-share competition against Nvidia and Intel. AMD's worldwide market share in the second quarter grew 2.8 percent from the same period last year, to 13.5 percent. Both Nvidia and Intel showed slight declines, though Nvidia still holds a commanding lead with a 72.6 percent market share. In addition, AMD saw a 4.03 percent bump in sales of discrete desktop GPUs over the first quarter, according to the analysts. Alibaba is looking to grow its cloud business to help it compete with the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure cloud business.             LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Google, Facebook Move To Curb Ads On 'Fake News' Sites Microsoft Outlook Customer Manager Helps SMBs Track Tasks, Contacts Facebook Unveils Messenger Group Chat in Canada, Australia How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Blades, Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel Google, IBM, Others Pitch Open Standard for Cloud Server Design by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on October 14, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet A group of tech giants working to mount a serious challenge to Intel in the data center, has previewed an upcoming open standard for interconnecting components in a server it is positioning as an alternative to Intel’s proprietary technology. The group includes Google, hardware vendors IBM, HP Enterprise, Dell EMC, as well as Intel’s more direct rivals AMD and NVIDIA, among others. IBM’s upcoming Power9 processors, expected to launch next year, will support the standard and so will IBM’s servers they will power. Intel currently dominates the market for server chips, and hyperscale data center operators like Google, which spend enormous amounts of money on hardware every quarter, want a viable alternative. They have generally adopted a multi-vendor strategy for sourcing nearly all components of their infrastructure, but it’s difficult to extend that strategy to processors given the size of Intel’s lead in the market. OpenCAPI and Power9 are aimed at the high end of the server market – computers used for data-intensive analytics workloads or machine learning. The group claims that the standard will be capable of boosting server performance tenfold. That performance improvement comes as a result of two things: higher bandwidth on the links between CPUs and accelerators and cache coherency, which essentially means data needs to be shuffled less within the system as it is being processed, saving resources as a result. Click chart to enlarge: Accelerators, or additional processors that take on a portion of the CPU’s workload to free up its resources, have been a mainstay in the world of supercomputers for years, but their role is now growing in importance in server architecture for cloud data centers and for the quickly emerging field of machine learning. “The compute model going forward is the marriage between a really good data-centric processor, like Power, and a really good set of acceleration technologies,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power Systems, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. Most accelerators in use today are GPUs, made by the likes of AMD and Nvidia, and some are Intel’s Xeon Phi, but there has also been growth in the use of FPGAs, or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, as accelerators. The advantage of FPGAs is that they can be reconfigured as workload needs change. Intel has invested heavily in FPGAs last year, paying $16.7 billion to acquire FPGA specialist Altera. The most prominent user of FPGAs to accelerate cloud workloads is Microsoft, whose latest-generation cloud server design supports the technology.

There are divergent views on this today, with companies like Nvidia supporting GPU-accelerated AI servers and Intel saying that model isn’t scalable, pitching the next generation of its Xeon Phi processors – codenamed Knights Mill and expected to hit the market next year – as the better alternative. Amazon’s cloud servers for data-intensive workloads, including machine learning, rely on GPUs, and so does Big Sur, Facebook’s open source server design for AI workloads.

The company hasn’t revealed any details about TPU’s architecture, saying only that it is an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) and that it is optimized for TensorFlow, its library of open source software for making AI applications. Google is also working on a server design together with Rackspace, which will run on IBM’s Power9 processors and have the OpenCAPI interface. The companies released the first draft of the Zaius server spec, which they plan to contribute to the Open Compute Project, today. The OpenCAPI consortium has an FPGA player among its members, in addition to server and GPU vendors. San Jose-based Xilinx plans to support OpenCAPI-enabled FPGAs, according to Friday’s announcement. IBM’s accelerator strategy has been to support as broad an array of choices as possible. Its current-generation Power8 chip supports NVIDIA’s GPU interconnect technology NVLink, and so will Power9, Balog said.

[Photo: Flickr user Brett Jordan] Mark Sullivan 10.14.16 6:01 AM Do Fortune 500 CEOs dream of electric sheep? No, they dream about the hundreds of ways their companies could be put out of business by the radical idea that they never see coming. A new business model, or some gadget. At first it's a novelty, easy to laugh off, but then it evolves, people begin to get it, and it catches on. Next thing you know, your company is Kodak, Blockbuster, or a taxi cab. There's no shortage of research and consulting firms that offer to help companies avoid these fates. Some might tout their design thinking chops, others employ improvisational comedy tropes. But a small Burbank, California, consulting and prototyping firm called SciFutures caught my eye for its own slightly odd approach. The firm works with a panel of 100 published science fiction writers to help its clients visualize their worst disruption nightmares, and then begin to imagine the products or business ideas that might offer them an alternate reality. SciFutures CEO and founder Ari Popper and CTO Scott Susskind truly believe that the biggest and most influential technologies of the future are often foretold in science fiction writing. Examples of this aren’t hard to find. In 1945, Arthur C. Clarke came up with the idea of using satellites for global communication. The internet was foreseen in the cyberpunk tales of William Gibson in the early '80s when people in university labs were just beginning to connect networks of computers. Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash credited The Matrix for showing that virtual reality (VR) is a viable idea. The augmented reality (AR) startup Magic Leap hired Snow Crash author Neal Stephenson to be its chief futurist. Scott Susskind The secret of innovation, according to SciFutures, can be unlocked by understanding how the realities, the knowns, of the present logically move toward the as-yet-unknown realities of the future. Science fiction prototyping—turning futuristic ideas into applied technologies—has been successfully used in the past, notably by futurist Brian David Johnson while he was working at Intel. Their integrated circuits had very long life cycles of between seven and 10 years, which meant the company had to anticipate the needs of the marketplace a decade in the future in order to design the next generation of chips. Companies had already been prototyping products using scenario-based design; Johnson had the good idea of using science fiction writing techniques to cast those scenarios 10 years in the future. He soon expanded the idea and wrote it into an Intel product design framework called the Consumer Experience Architecture. Johnson may have introduced the concept to the world, but Popper says SciFutures is the first company to found a business on Science Fiction Prototyping. The story goes that Popper was doing a sci-fi writers group when he had an epiphany that sci-fi might help unlock the corporate creative forces that give birth to game-changing products. He says he wasn’t completely sure the idea could become a viable business, but he decided to try it anyway. He later brought on Susskind to focus on the physical prototyping part of the business. As Popper and company have refined their "future-casting" workshops and the way they work with sci-fi writers, the SciFutures idea started to work. Now the firm’s client list includes Samsung and Intel, consumer packaged goods companies like The Hershey Company and Clorox, and financial services companies such as Visa and the Ford Motor Company. Ari Popper SciFutures’ best-known project was helping the Lowe’s hardware store chain conceive of and create the HoloRoom, a 20-by-20-foot physical space in which shoppers can see how various Lowe’s products (like paints, flooring, or window coverings) would look in their own homes. Customers use a tablet to pick out the products—3D representations of them—then use an AR headset to see the products placed in context in the home. They can then quickly flip through different paint and window covering combinations, for example. The first HoloRooms were opened in two Lowe’s stores in Canada in 2014, then in 19 U.S. stores starting in 2015. Since then Lowe's has continued developing the HoloRooms with different technology partners. The HoloRoom was one of the ideas that bubbled up when Lowe’s Innovation Lab went through the SciFutures process, complete with science fiction writer punch-ups and product prototyping. Augmented reality-aided shopping isn’t exactly new, but SciFutures and Lowe’s brought it to consumers well in advance of other major retailers. Ikea, for example, launched its AR shopping app this past April. The online furniture retailer Wayfair.com launched its WayfairView app in June using Google's Project Tango AR software. A Trip To Tomorrowland The SciFutures office is nestled between an audio/video rental shop and a rehab center in a cluster of office buildings. The top floor is an open space with large skylights, a couple large conference rooms, an open kitchen, one large office where Popper and Scott sit, and a couple of large worktables where the company’s account reps, marketing people, and support staff work. On the first floor I saw a shop loaded with tools for building demos and prototypes, and a big industrial space where large physical exhibits are built, such as a car interior exhibit built to demo Visa’s in-car mobile payments. The most interesting place in the building was across the hall: the emerging technology and prototype demo lab. The space is partly for show and partly for work. Half of it is outfitted with the couches, tables, and TVs you always see in Internet of Things (IoT) or smart home demos. VR headsets were there for use by visitors. And underneath one of the TVs was a dense bank of digital production gear, a keyboard, and some headgear. Some serious VR or AR programming—real prototyping and development work—had been going on there before I arrived. Maybe the L.A. heat had got to me, but in this room I started to pick up on a sort of Disney World "anything can happen" vibe. The room is full of tables on which staff are busy "playing" with emerging technologies that will be combined in various ways to create something as yet unseen. Most of the prototypes are top secret at the moment, but a few were already public. One table was littered with home appliances and tablet PCs, with an Amazon Echo voice-based personal assistant device in the center controlling it all. In fact, SciFutures has become a leading developer of new "skills" for Alexa, the natural language brain that powers Echo. They just built a skill for Glad that tells you what’s recyclable and gives advice on how to do it. One table was littered with the fronts of credit card payment terminals; the SciFutures engineers were demonstrating how thieves use them to easily "scrape" credit card information at the countertop or the ATM. SciFutures has at least one military client, NATO’s Allied Command Transformation, who it is helping "imagine the future of warfare," says Popper. And that’s about all he would tell me about it. The Storytellers The freelance writers who work with SciFutures aren’t given a whole lot to go on, and they never meet or talk to the client. That’s by design. They’re given a short brief about the client’s products and industry, and about the outcomes of a workshop (more on that later). The writer then creates a two- to three-page story treatment over the course of a few days that shows where the technology might go. The treatments use a familiar format and story arc; they usually focus on one or two main characters and their discovery and interaction with the technology, as well as the cultural context in which it happens—the political, social, and psychological effects on people. SciFutures exerts some influence on the result by selecting which writer or writers will work on a specific client account. SciFutures categorizes writers by their focus areas, interests, research areas, hobbies, prior careers, age, geography, and psychographic information. It’s also important that the writer targets the right kind of "future" in the treatment. Popper says he looks for the right balance between the fantastic and the realistic. "You kind of remove a layer of abstraction between the person sitting in a lab and the user deriving pleasure from using the product."—Divya Breed, sci-fi author "The work we do is more like predicting, like projecting 10 to 15 years out into the future," one of the writers from SciFutures’ panel, Divya Breed, told me. "It’s not so much fantasizing but more like thinking wishfully—thinking of fun ways the tech could be developed." Breed, who once worked as an engineer at a tech company, says now that she’s a professional writer she’s still immersed in tech; she still runs in social circles where it's usually the topic of conversation. Emerging technologies are also the subject of her research for her own sci-fi work. All of that can potentially influence her take on the technology described in the assignments she gets. Another SciFutures writer, Brenta Blevins, is a professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and focuses her research on virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality tech. "The writers are trying to produce multiple science fiction treatments that show multiple different ways these products can change people’s lives," she told me. Brenta Blevins I asked Blevins why she thinks the SciFutures process works. "It’s the power of story; stories are the original reality simulators," she says. "These are thought experiments that provide this wide range of ways to think about these products." The narratives offer a chance to portray all the ways new technologies might impact human beings, she says. The imaginings of writers like Breed and Blevins brings a very different flavor to SciFutures’ process and deliverables, compared to that of other consultants. "You kind of remove a layer of abstraction between the person sitting in a lab and the user deriving pleasure from using the product," says Breed. "It helps bridge that gap and helps people make new product real." The work done in the workshops, and the further ideation by the sci-fi writers, culminates in an array of deliverables for the client company. It might be written or verbal consulting, animations, or videos, or a graphic novel. Divya Breed SciFutures also provides clients with a graphical map that shows all the ideas discussed and the technologies that would need to be brought to bear to create them. The map looks something like a solar system map, with each idea placed by type into a pie slice around the middle. Within each of those segments the supporting technologies for the ideas are arranged closer or further from the center based on their viability score. That is, technologies closer to the middle are mature, ready to deploy, while less mature technologies (like mind-machine interfaces) are placed toward the outside solar system. For Hershey, SciFutures created a graphic novel that portrayed how people might use 3D-printed food (not just chocolate) in the future. The point is to place the ideas created in the workgroup or by the sci-fi authors into real-life settings and human situations to bring the whole thing closer to reality. Hershey had already built and productized 3D-printed chocolate after the company’s CEO met a 3D printing company executive at a conference and told his new friend "we should do business together." Soon after, it became Hershey innovation group manager Jeff Mundt’s task to figure out how the technology might evolve, how people might want to 3D-print food in the future. "We have created very intricate [chocolate] shapes, but now what?" Mundt says. "What’s the commercial path for this? If people are going to use it, what might that look like? Are you really going to print out your breakfast while you’re sleeping?" Understanding what chocolate consumers want today requires only traditional market research, Mundt points out, but understanding the wants of people in the future is something different. The SciFutures process helped Mundt and his group tackle some hard questions about 3D printing. "The story can help you create that roadmap," Mundt says. "If that’s going to be true, then what are the steps that are going to be necessary to get us there? So you can kind of work backwards." Mundt points out that the SciFutures process was just one possible approach, and that approach isn’t for everybody. "We are a conservative company, and what you get from working with SciFutures is something that looks like a comic book," Mundt says. "It’s actually an illustrated narrative, but a senior manager at a conservative CPG (consumer packaged goods) company might be looking for Nielsen data, [and might ask] ‘Why would I do that?" "There's definitely a healthy tension between being too close in, where you're not really disrupting and pushing, and so far out where it becomes ridiculous and meaningless," Popper says. "[We] know how to really get the best out of both worlds, so it will be disruptive and imaginative enough that you're pushing the boundaries, but have enough of a link back to today so that you can build to that." SciFutures earns consulting fees for their initial ideation work with clients, but the hope is that the process will graduate to the next phase. "What we then hope it does is trigger the prototyping so that we can start to build early-stage articulations of [actual products]," Susskind says. The entire bottom floor of SciFutures’ space in Burbank is reserved for just that. Antibodies SciFutures has had its failures. A couple of young and energetic executives from a large consumer products company (Popper asked me not to mention the name) came to SciFutures to help them conceive of some new and futuristic ways of marketing a new technology they’d invented. The first major step in SciFutures’ process is a "grounding" meeting with the client in which Popper, Susskind, an in-house sci-fi writer, and some staffers work to orient the client to emerging technologies in general, and to the emerging technologies that might impact the client specifically. The workshops involve anywhere from five to 30 people. After the foundations have been laid, a new phase begins: the "disorienting." The client is told to forget about the day-to-day concerns of the business and complete a number of writing exercises in which they imagine the dystopian future of the company, and the technology and services that might be in it. "Let's put ourselves out of business applying what we've learned," Popper says (speaking for the client). For instance, during a workshop SciFutures did with Ford’s Future’s Group, the Ford people imagined a future in which nobody owns cars but rather shares or borrows them. "It helps everyone articulate unconscious fears that they might have about their business that they've never brought up or have frankly never even thought about," says Popper. After the client has scared the daylights out of themselves by imagining a future where their company has been disrupted out of business, they start to think about how a happy ending might come about. "They do a little dystopic diligence and use that information as a way to elevate their company, their product, business model, whatever it might be," Susskind says. Some of the ideas generated in the workshops, if acted upon, could mean major strategic changes and reallocation of resources. That’s scary to people with children and mortgages. Popper says these people often hit a breaking point when those self-preservation instincts kick in. They often use statements like: "That will never work," or "You can't do that," or "Why?" or "You just can't," Popper says. "The body language is funny," Susskind says. "It's like a threat; I'm protecting my body against a threat." Popper says when his team initially began to witness this type of response, they thought they were doing something wrong by going too far. But they soon recognized it as a symptom of something going right. "We push them, and sometimes they're just too afraid, and they stop," Popper says. "We've had clients where we've had to go, ‘Okay.’" In the case of the unnamed consumer products company, the junior execs who championed SciFutures internally were full of energy and good intentions, Popper says. But more senior people within the company were only interested in "giving lip service" to innovation without really doing anything. They had even set up an "innovation fund" and allotted some cash to it. One high-ranking exec pulled Popper aside and said: "Look, I'm not supposed to say this, but I'm going to tell you guys anyway. We need to change—and we never will." And that’s why the SciFutures process ultimately didn’t work there. "You can't do this halfheartedly, Popper says. "It's painful and it's bruises, but that's when you get to the really great work; they just didn't give themselves the permission or the space to get into it." They Want To Believe Popper is a very convincing guy. He’s a very likable guy. His customers say he’s extremely energized about technology, a true believer, and that his excitement has a way of rubbing off on others. Popper’s personality is important because SciFutures wants to do more than just sci-fi ideation and prototyping. They want to evangelize; they want to help win the battle for hearts and minds within the client’s walls. Popper and Susskind told me they are very concerned about finding people at the client who get the need for change and new ideas, but also a budget, and the political juice to push the ideas to fruition. Popper: "We feel that if we haven't changed behavior or if we haven't created a need for product or a meaningful new way of doing business, then we actually haven't been that successful, all we've done is entertain people, and you can go see a sci-fi film to do that." Susskind, too, exudes the kind of blue-sky, optimistic vibe I felt in Burbank. He’s also an engineer—steeped in a kaleidoscope of near-field and far-field emerging technologies—a kind of MacGyver, the guy who knows how to gather all the right hardware and software ingredients. For one prototype, Susskind might source technologies from 10 different partners and piece them altogether into a device that’s never been seen before. The tables down on the first floor at SciFutures are littered with such parts. The trouble with prototyping is that it's expensive. Building just one can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's why SciFutures has begun creating virtual prototypes using augmented reality tech, to show clients how a product might work in the real world, and allow people from the client to share it with other people in the company. The difference is that the product is seen through the screen of a tablet or through a headset like Microsoft’s HoloLens. "People can see them and almost have a visceral experience, just short of actually physically holding it in your hand, but it will still show potential," Susskind says. But no matter how real the simulation or convincing the prototype, for executives who can’t or won’t confront change and embrace their fears, the future will remain a scary, dangerous place. And those who do choose to change have to survive sometimes painful internal transformations, overcoming lots of doubt along the way. Popper makes it sound almost spiritual: "In order to start something new you have to stop doing what you were doing," he says. "It’s about realigning your efforts, and it ultimately leads to a new place of knowledge, confidence, and wisdom." Never miss a story.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft may announce updated Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 devices later this month 0 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Oct 14, 2016 at 15:53 GMT1 month ago Microsoft is expected to introduce a new type of Surface device later this month at an event in New York. It is almost confirmed that the new type of Surface would be an All-In-One. Earlier this week, we also reported that Microsoft may also reveal updated Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices  featuring Intel’s Kabylake processors. Amazon listings of these devices have been now updated with “OLD VERSION” tag which indicates that new versions of these devices are coming. Intel 7th Gen (Kaby Lake) processors are built using 14-nanometer architecture and they offer improved graphics, native USB 3.1 support, improved 4k video support, and more. More importantly, 7th gen processors offer more battery life as well. I expect Surface Book Clipboard with Intel Kaby Lake processors to offer battery life of solid 3-4 hours. I think it will be a good move from Microsoft to release the updated Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 devices this year instead of waiting for the major upgrade which is expected in Q2 2017. Meanwhile, Amazon is also offering great discounts on these devices. You can now get Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (128 GB, 4 GB RAM, Intel Core i5) for just $719. Surface Book with 128 GB, 8 GB RAM and Intel Core i5 is now available for $1,222. Find the links to order below.

Yesterday the venerable Christian Science Monitor announced it was abandoning daily print publication. In Portfolio, Marc Andreessen proposes that other newspapers follow suit and finally give up on print: If you were running the New York Times, what would you do? Shut off the print edition right now. You’ve got to play offense. You’ve got to do what Intel did in ’85 when it was getting killed by the Japanese in memory chips, which was its dominant business. And it famously killed the business — shut it off and focused on its much smaller business, microprocessors, because that was going to be the market of the future. And the minute Intel got out of playing defense and into playing offense, its future was secure. The newspaper companies have to do exactly the same thing. The financial markets have discounted forward to the terminal conclusion for newspapers, which is basically bankruptcy. So at this point, if you’re one of these major newspapers and you shut off the printing press, your stock price would probably go up, despite the fact that you would lose 90 percent of your revenue. Then you play offense. And guess what? You’re an internet company. The Intel reference here is an oblique reference to Andy Grove’s famous comment to the ASNE that the newspaper industry had three years to adapt or die. That was in 1999. Andreessen’s advice makes total sense in many ways — it would be fascinating and worthwhile for at least one major newspaper publisher to try it. This sort of turn-your-company-on-a-dime idea is part of the Silicon Valley ethos. But I just don’t see it happening. Hard though it no doubt was, it’s still a lot easier for a hardware company like Intel to retool its fabs and its engineers to produce a different kind of chip than for a newspaper company to retool its reporters and editors to produce a different kind of media product. Shutting off the presses at the New York Times, or any other major newspaper publisher, would make the company an “internet-only company.” But it wouldn’t make it an Internet Company, in the larger sense. You’d still have a newsroom full of people used to doing things a certain way, proud, with good reason, of that way, and suspicious of change. It’s much easier to build a new company from scratch than to transform an existing one into something new. But the bigger problem isn’t psychological, it’s financial. I base my views on a decade of experience at Salon, trying to support an online-only newsroom with online-only revenues. It turns out that the hardest part of this massive and inevitable industrial transition is not reconstituting high-quality journalism in a new media environment. That’s only mildly hard. Top-notch journalists will always seek to do top-notch work. The really tough part — the part that to this day remains unsolved — is figuring out how to support those top-notch journalists with the salaries and benefits they are accustomed to, and often deserve. (That’s not even taking into account the loss of jobs on the printing and distribution side. But they are disappearing eventually no matter what.) The problem today is not much easier than it was when we started Salon in 1995: Look at Politico — an online success d’estime that still earns 90 percent of its revenue from a niche print product. Newspaper companies are clinging to their dwindling print profits because they can’t yet see a way to keep anything close to their current pay scale and benefits in an online-only world. And the hardest pill for the industry to swallow is that there may not be any way to do that. Internet companies pay top dollar to their engineers, not their “content producers.” There is no shortage of reasonably high quality content on the Web, much of it produced for free or little pay. Of course blogs and “user generated content” can’t replace the collective output of the nation’s journalism professionals today. But they offer plenty of alternatives, and enough occasions on which they surpass the pros (or expose the pros’ failings) to keep readers occupied, and sometimes satisfied. As Bruce Reed wrote in Slate last year during the Hollywood writer’s strike, “There is no such thing as a writer’s market. With or without subsidy, words are always in surplus, and it’s always a reader’s market.” No amount of handwringing will change that. If newspapers are really going to take the leap Andreessen proposes, they will have to do it while simultaneously restructuring their deals with their employees and mandating painful cuts that nobody wants to accept. Which is why I don’t think they will do it at all. Ironically, of course, those jobs will vanish anyway. As I wrote in June, I think the newspaper-company ships are doomed to sink, and individual journalists will have to find their own individual lifeboats and routes to shore. The sooner they start, the better. ELSEWHERE: Mark Potts thinks “Newspapers haven’t even scratched the surface on potential online advertising revenue” and an exclusively online operation could rake in more money. I don’t know; I’ve been there, done that, and it’s not so easy. Alan Mutter says the magic multiple is 3 — newspapers would have to triple their current online revenue to break even.

Comments Rangachari Anand October 29, 2008 at 12:15 pm I think newspapers will have to move to the NPR model and become non-profit organizations supported by donations. turph October 29, 2008 at 12:31 pm I agree that newspapers have not scratched the surface of advertising yet either. We went through a brief period where content was king, but now good content with blended attributes is king. Google is printing money serving out loosely targeted ads based on very unstructured content. CTR is ridiculously low when ads are populated next to this unstructured content. What leverage/value could publishers gain by “adding value” to their content? Adding contextual relevance to content would only increase CTR, creating premium content, demanding higher CPC which the publisher should be charging for… Cléo Saulnier October 29, 2008 at 3:33 pm Fantastic post. Scott, I’m curious what you think the effect is of the current trend of the medium itself having no value. In the past, if you wanted information, you had to pay for the medium no matter what was on it. We’re seeing the music and the film industry fight with this issue right now in what they call piracy. Now, there isn’t as much alternative content in music and film as there is for printed materials, but do you see a crossover symptom with the lowered costs of the medium itself? Andrew Brown October 30, 2008 at 3:28 am As someone who has just started a newspaper subsite, which pays contributors insultingly little, I have a lot of sympathy with this argument but I can’t believe it represents the only future. Newspapers which deliver news that people need to make decisions from — eg the Financial Times — will continue to be profitable, I think, and to be able to charge. In the meantime, what papers need to do is to put huge resources into comment moderation. Because, while comments are free, the toxic ones are fantastically expensive in terms of opportunities foregone, and fastidious or even literate readers driven away. ON a purely self-interested argument the papers are pissing away the kind of readers to whom advertisers might be attracted. Geoff Dougherty October 30, 2008 at 12:38 pm We get a 10% CTR on ads that are geotargeted to appear alongside news that happens near our advertisers’ stores. It took us a day to write the code to make this work, and we sell the ads for well over the standard $10 cpm. Clearly there are unexplored strategies out there that could make online more lucrative. There’s also thousands of newspapers out there that still publish “websites” consisting of jpegs of their print pages. The issue isn’t lack of options, it’s lack of a clue. J. Todd Foster October 30, 2008 at 1:16 pm Not all newspapers will be dying such quick deaths. Community papers will be around for decades because most of our readers prefer ink on paper, not computer screens. And most of the advertising dollars out there are national ads, not local ones in small markets where much of the population is not wired. Scott Rosenberg October 30, 2008 at 1:21 pm But will “most of your readers” prefer ink “for decades”? Really? Even as the grandparents pass away and the kids weaned on the Web and iPhones grow up? I don’t know. Here in the Bay Area the community papers are already in trouble; this is an early-adopter kind of community, but it seems to me that the rest of the nation isn’t likely to be too far behind… sophie jensen October 30, 2008 at 1:39 pm Andrew Brown: what you said! Those toxic comments do drive away readers. Of course we know we can not read them but they have a hypnotic effect and once in a while there’s a gem like yours. Without moderation many sites will become Idiocracy attracting only the sub-literate– probably not what advertisers want. Walter Abbott October 30, 2008 at 2:03 pm Newspapers never were producers of a product. ‘News’ isn’t a product, it’s merely distributed information and newspapers are just one of the distribution systems. The worth to advertisers was the monopoly that newspapers had on distribution via a durable media. Newspaper could always tell advertisers that unlike electronic broadcast distribution, paper ads were semi-permanent. That’s gone now. The internet is a technologically superior method of information distribution and can more efficiently deliver advertising to potential customers. There’s nothing anyone can do. It’s progress. Newsmaven October 30, 2008 at 2:37 pm It’s true there are a lot of community papers out there that have some life left in them. They’re making money while most of top metro papers are not. The Monitor is stopping its print edition, but will keep some kind of weekly magazine. Politico, as pointed out, stays afloat via their print side. The Times, if they put a yardstick to it (which they surely do), probably loses money on most weekdays and rakes in cash on Sundays. This points to a transitional model that’s a digital/print hybrid which could take many forms in different places. To do this, however, newspapers first have to turn their heads around and decide, finally, that they are digital businesses, focused on publishing online content and creating online communities, 24/7. No US newspaper organization, including the Times, has truly done this—they continue to be organized around that evening deadline for the print product, and everything else is secondary. And their reporters and salespeople continue to carry business cards with the prominent name and logo of the printed paper, not that of their web site. Andreessen’s solution is radical, and he probably knows it’s not going to happen, not right now. But the Times and all other daily newspapers could, and should, consider the radical-enough solution of going digital by dropping everything except a profitable, ad- and feature-laden Sunday package (and probably switching that to Saturday publication). Cutting out six mostly break-even distribution days a week would be a lot smarter than cutting out 40 percent of their news staffs. Scott Rosenberg October 30, 2008 at 2:46 pm I’m with you on most of that. I just doubt newspapers will make these hard choices until it’s much too late. Too much pride, too much head-in-the-sand thinking, too much unwillingness to give up on an outmoded but still partially lucrative business model, too much confusion between the “product” (paper goods) and the service-that’s-valued (providing news and information). In other words — yes, they’d have to “turn their heads around” and no, I don’t think they will. tjm October 30, 2008 at 4:40 pm Russ Stanton, the latest LAT editor, said in a radio interview early this year that the LAT web revenue was at or near the break even point of editorial costs, meaning that assuming continued modest growth since, it could support the newsroom right now. The problem many newspapers have been having is not that the web isn’t profitable, it’s that it isn’t profitable enough to sustain their owners at the levels to which they had become accustomed. Or, as in the case of the LAT and Tribune, not profitable enough to support Sam Zell’s debt. The great irony is that the traditional newsprint product, over the decline of which so much angst is being spent, is still a cash-flow powerhouse. People won’t get rid of it because it’s too profitable. If I owned a newspaper, I’d get rid of the trucks and the trees tomorrow, give every subscriber a custom Kindle or netbook-type device, in-home training in how to use it and make myself into a media, database and internet-training company. I would consider partnerships to build out civic WiFi infrastructure and paper (sic) the circulation area with video readerboards of the newspaper’s content. Trackbacks Certamente!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 14 October 2016 | MYT 1:46 PM IBM, Google, others to unveil new open interface to take on Intel Opting out: Intel is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. — Reuters Technology giants IBM Corp, Google and seven others have joined hands to launch an open specification that can boost datacentre server performance by up to ten times, to take on Intel Corp.  The new standard, called Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI), is an open forum to provide a high bandwidth, low latency open interface design specification.  The open interface will help corporate and cloud datacentres to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads.  The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement.  Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z.  "As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today's digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm," Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters.  "It's clear that today's datacentres can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation," Balog said.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Mellanox Technologies Ltd, Micron Technology Inc, NVIDIA Corp and Xilinx Inc are also members of the the OpenCAPI consortium. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Investing , Technology You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Fine-tune your songs Cyclist has grand tales to tell after going through 22 countries MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Taliworks net profit jumps 80% SME contribution to GDP to grow 5%-5.5% this year US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Warning!

This is why it isn’t surprising to see that Intel has actually branched out into drones, and we’re not talking about reference designs or chipsets for drones, but an actual Intel-branded drone called the Falcon 8+. This is actually not Intel’s first foray into the drone scene as previously the company had partnered with Ascending Technologies, but this is the first time Intel has actually made a drone of its own. Unlike drones made by other companies such as Parrot DJI, Intel’s Falcon 8+ isn’t really a drone for hobbyists, but rather it is a drone made for industrial work. For example it can be used on construction jobs where the Falcon 8+ can fly around the site to survey things and also for inspection purposes, an activity that might otherwise take humans a couple of hours to complete. It also features a waterproof cockpit so pilots don’t have to worry about it getting damaged. The Falcon 8+ weighs 6 pounds and is capable of reaching speeds of up to 35 mph, a lot faster than most hobbyist drones out there in the market today. No word on availability or how much it will cost, but we don’t expect that it will come cheap. Filed in Robots. Read more about drones and Intel.

Now, a 3D-printed back brace has been created to help prevent further curvature of the spine while looking and feeling more comfortable. ADVERTISEMENT Designed in collaboration with Studio Bitonti, the Align by UNYQ is a customisable and "breathable" brace that aims to be stylish, use fewer materials, and can be worn for multiple hours a day. The Align is also able to help patients track their personal data, which can be used in the treatment process. To do this an Intel chip, said to be the size of a button, has been included in the brace.

The first iteration of the design was recently unveiled at the FashionNXT show in Portland. Studio Bitonti/Jason Perry Francis Bitonti said his firm always starts the design process by thinking through the code needed before it designs its products.

He also said it was rare for a device that can be used for medical treatments to be launched at a fashion show. "Francis Bitonti, Peter Wildfeuer and Li Chen used innovative topology optimisation technology to create the most lightweight and beautiful scoliosis brace," Eythor Bender, UNYQ's CEO added. ADVERTISEMENT "A pilot program demonstrated the UNYQ Brace is as effective as the current gold standard and easier and more desirable to wear," UNYQ says on its website. The UNYQ Align has even garnered attention at the highest levels in the US. On September 15 the firm launched the Align at the White House. At the event, Grace Mosier, a 15-year-old wearer of the brace said it was "more comfortable" and made her feel more confident than other braces she had previously worn.

EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless Firmed Up In Mesa For ChromeOS Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 15 October 2016 at 08:15 AM EDT. 1 Comment Chad Versace, the Intel OTC developer turned Googler who is part of the Chrome OS driver team, has been baking the EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless extension and its implementation inside Mesa. EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless is used by Chrome OS with its Freon stack and the EGL null platform. The EGL extension is described by the tentative specification as "This extension defines a new EGL platform, the "surfaceless" platform. This platfom's defining property is that it has no native surfaces, and hence neither eglCreatePlatformWindowSurface nor eglCreatePlatformPixmapSurface can be used. The platform is independent of any native window system. The platform's intended use case is for enabling OpenGL and OpenGL ES applications on systems where no window system exists. However, the platform's permitted usage is not restricted to this case. Since the platform is independent of any native window system, it may also be used on systems where a window system is present." The implementation is in Mesa Git in time for the next release. The specification is currently working its way into the public Khronos EGL repository. This extension should be applicable to some interesting use-cases too outside of Chrome OS. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

At this moment in time there's no application for half-ssd-half-Ram. The idea is indeed great, and there was news just days ago about some rival technology. But in case Intel releases 16 and 32 GB drives they won't achieve anything, as as SSD it will be already slower than ordinary NAND SSD, and as RAM (as I already told) it won't have practical appliance. It's like trying to promote new CPU with only 1% of its performance. Will it convince anyone? No.     SirDremor View Public Profile Find all posts by SirDremor   (#8) jarablue Member Guru   Videocard: nVidia 960m 2GB Processor: Intel 6700HQ Mainboard: Asus Laptop GL752VW Memory: DDR Samsung memory Soundcard: Conexant PSU: Asus Laptop GL752VW 10-14-2016, 23:37 | posts: 63 | Location: Worcester, MA What a let down.

It's pretty obvious those numbers are after any cache on the Optane is depleted. While it's true Intel has failed at media relations lately, this leak was without context and without thoughtful analysis by guru3d. Think about those 950 Pro speeds. They're inflated, after the DDR cache is full the speeds drop dramatically. 950 Pro out of cache can be as low as 200MB writes and this 32GB Optane lowend is apparently 500MB.

China’s largest e-commerce company is working on expanding the range of services it offers over the internet and will work with Advanced Micro Devices to use the chipmaker’s Radeon Pro graphics, the companies said Friday in a statement. For AMD, which is the second-largest maker of graphics chips used in high-end computers behind Nvidia Corp., the deal is the chance to kick start a return to the lucrative data center market dominated by Intel Corp. Graphics chips are playing an increasing role in data centers where their ability to process information in parallel makes them useful in certain work loads such as image recognition. Nvidia has pioneered this more general use of the chips, which had mainly been used by computer gamers to get a more realistic experience from their hardware. AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, has begun its fight back from market share losses to Nvidia in graphics and Intel in general purpose processors with new products that have closed the gap in performance. AMD’s stock has more than doubled this year, making it the best performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, spurred by improving sales and progress in its attempt to return to profitability.

Mello Jr. Oct 14, 2016 10:27 AM PT Watch out, Apple. HP on Wednesday introduced a new generation of premium computer products that could generate the kind of excitement in the market that's usually the domain of the folks at One Infinite Loop. Among the new HP offerings are a new tablet-laptop convertible, a svelte laptop, an innovative all-in-one model, and a 4k display designed for dual screen setups. "HP has absolutely raised their bar in design, quality and performance," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. The new HP machines target the premium end of the PC market, he told TechNewsWorld. "The target market for these are consumers who care a lot about design and performance and are willing to pay for it," said Moorhead. "HP has been gaining premium PC market share in U.S. retail, so they must have obviously cracked the code there." Convertible and Laptop HP's convertible offering is the Spectre x360 (pictured above), which is 2 millimeters thinner than its predecessor and now weighs less than 3 pounds. It has a 13.3-inch FHD IPS display, four speakers and is offered with either an i5 or an i7 seventh-generation Intel Core processor. It supports log-in via facial recognition and has up to 15 hours of battery life. What's more, the battery can be charged 90 percent in 90 minutes via a quick-charge function. The Spectre x360, available immediately, sells for US$1,049.99. HP's laptop offering, the Envy, offers more battery life than its predecessor -- it has a runtime of up to 14 hours -- but at 14mm thick and 3.15 pounds, it's not as thin and light. It has a 13.3-inch display with a touchscreen option and an extra-wide glass touchpad. HP Envy Laptop The Envy will be available Oct. 26 priced at $849.99. All-In-One and Monitor The Envy AIO 27 is HP's all-in-one desktop unit. It has a 27-inch QHD 3.6 million-pixel display that is just 15mm thick, because all the computing and storage power resides in the monitor's base. The display supports a "low blue light" mode for improved eye comfort. The base has a sound bar with four speakers tuned by Bang & Olufsen. Other features include a webcam that pops into the display when not in use, support for sixth-generation Intel quad core i5 or i7 desktop processors, storage on a solid state drive of up to 256 gigabytes, a hard drive of up to 2 terabytes, and HDMI in and out ports. The AIO 27 sells for $1,299 and will be available this month. HP's new monitor is the 27-inch Envy 27. It supports 4K video and has a micro-edge bezel. Its RGB color accuracy exceeds 99 percent and includes a Display Port, HDMI and USB C, which can be used to charge devices. The Envy 27 will be available Dec. 4 for $499.99. Apple Dropped the Ball The new HP offerings meet an unfulfilled need in the market, said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. "These are premium-looking and well-configured products," he told TechNewsWorld, "and given how Apple has dropped the ball advancing the Mac, there's an opportunity on the premium side of PCs." Sinking PC shipments have spurred computer makers to intensify their efforts to impress. "It's become more incumbent upon the companies staying in the market to drive more profit from the premium end," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst with Reticle Research. "Of course, Apple has been strong in that segment of the market," he told TechNewsWorld. However, Apple is expected to pick up the ball again at the end of the month with a refresh of its Macintosh line of computers. "It's too early to tell if HP has upstaged Apple until we see what Apple comes out with next," Moorhead said. "It does set a higher bar for Apple to cross, though." Reviving PC Market PC shipments have been declining for years, although there was a small bump up in this year's second quarter. PC shipments in the United States jumped 1.4 percent compared with the same period a year ago, reported Gartner, which includes tablets in its tallies. PC shipments climbed 4.9 percent, according to IDC, which excludes tablets. Worldwide shipments fell, however -- by 5.2 percent according to Gartner, and by 4.9 percent according to IDC's analysis. HP and others hope to create some momentum in the market by introducing new premium products capable of generating the kind of excitement that could infect the whole market. "In aggregate with what Dell and Lenovo have done, HP's new line could breathe some new life into the PC market," Moorhead said. PCs Not Dead HP also is hoping the new line can prod consumers to buy a new computer. "All PC manufacturers are trying to kickstart the replacement market," said Jack E. Gold of J.Gold Associates. "Everyone says PC's are dead," he told TechNewsWorld. "PCs aren't dead. It's just that people are holding onto them for much longer than they have in the past," Gold pointed out. "Lenovo, HP, Dell -- they're all trying to find ways to bring some excitement back into the market," he said. "They're looking at new form factors and all sorts of things to get consumers to get excited and buy upgrades. It's not a bad strategy." Will the new HP offerings excite consumers enough to trade in their old PCs? "It's always a challenge to get people to spend money for tech," Gold acknowledged, "but for those users who have not been upgrading in the past, there's a lot of stuff here to really like."

In the role, Reid will lead creative across Deep Focus’s client roster, which includes Nestlé, Frito-Lay, eBay, Intel and Purina, while reporting directly to CEO Ian Schafer. “John’s unique mix of traditional and digital brand-building experience makes him well-positioned to further establish Deep Focus as a world-class integrated creative agency,” Schafer said in a statement, adding that he sees Reid’s hire as a turning point and that Deep Focus has begun to compete more directly with “traditional” agencies for new business — especially over the past year. Schafer said: “There are instances where we’ve been brought on as a social agency and ended up as lead creative agency. It seems like everything is up for grabs to everyone in many cases as long as you meet the minimum requirements. … The RFPs we’ve been getting over the past year have been vaguer than ever before, and I see that as an opportunity.” Reid fills a role left vacant since Engine Group spun off Deep Focus’ content creation studio, Moment Studio, as a separate Engine Group unit with Ken Kraemer serving as CEO. “It’s been quite a long journey in hiring someone [to replace Kraemer],” Schafer told Adweek. “We’re happy to have found the right person.” Reid has served as executive vice president, chief creative officer for Wunderman since July of 2010, working with clients including P&G, Audi, Campbell’s V8, E*Trade, the Ad Council, AARP, BMO Harris Bank, Johnson and Johnson and Land Rover. Before joining Wunderman he served short stints as a creative director with ATTIK, working with Toyota, TiVo, Lucas Arts, OnLive, Ubisoft and HBO, and a freelance creative director with CP+B before that, working with Microsoft, American Express, Best Buy, Burger King and Coke Zero. Prior to that he spent over six and half years as a vice president, associate creative director with McCann Erickson, where he worked with Microsoft, HP, the Oakland A’s, Nortel, and AMD. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The compact desktop computer measures 4.5 x 4.4 x 1.7-inches (or less) and supports Intel Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 Kaby Lake-U series processors. Small enough to attach to the back of a display using a VESA mount, the Cubi 2 comes with both a DisplayPort and HDMI output, allowing users to attach two displays. Related: Best gaming PC What's more, the integrated Intel HD 620 graphics means the Cubi 2 is capable of supporting displays with up to 4K resolutions. In terms of other ports, there's also three USB 3.1 ports, a USB Type-C connection, separate mic and headphone jacks, and an Ethernet port. MSI is offering two versions of the computer, one with enough room for an M.2 solid state drive, and a slightly larger version capable of housing M.2 storage and a 2.5-inch hard drive or SSD. The company also claims the device is as 'quiet as a forest', which basically means the Cubi 2 comes with a low noise fan, resulting in a noise level of 23.7 dB. There's a black and white version of the Cubi 2, both of which will be available globally soon. While the computer seems to be available in the US now, UK pricing is currently unavailable, but we're hoping to have more on that in the near future. In the US, the computer is available starting at $299 for the Core i3 model, $379 for the i5 model and $499 for the i7 version.

The Vensmile K8 Foldable Keyboard Mini PC features a rolling-up rubber mat keyboard attached to the left side of a rectangular mini-PC which itself hosts a touchpad surface. You might sense I am struggling to describe this thing, but luckily a picture says a thousand words. Please see below. The K8 is powered by an Intel Atom X5 Z8300 'Cherry Trail' quad-core processor. This 14nm 2W SDP processor has a base/boost frequency of 1.44GHz/1.84GHz. It sports Intel HD graphics with a max resolution of 1980 x 1080, Full HD. To accompany the processor at the heart of its machine, Vensmile has equipped 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. Other key specs are Wi-Fi 2.4-5.8g/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 support, plus an array of ports which include an HDMI out, VGA out, 1x USB 3.0 port, 1x USB 2.0 port, a TF card slot, and a 3.5mm audio jack. This rather light (277g) machine runs off a 5V 3A power input. When rolled open the K8 measures 385 x 120 x 15mm. From the pictures it looks like the keyboard is splash resistant but I notice the splash isn't big enough to envelope the electronic heart of the PC to the right... The above hardware specs are standard fare for many an HDMI stick, tablet, or similar portable PC, so let's have a look at the Vensmile K8's particular attraction: having a full sized keyboard and decent sized multi-touch touchpad built-in/on. The keyboard looks like one of the common-or-garden flexible silicone keyboards that you can pick up for as little as a fiver but very few of which receive accolades for typing comfort. To the right of this is the attached computer 'chassis' which provides a touchpad surface over most of its upper surface area. The only other thing you need to get computing on the go is a monitor/TV. As headlined, this Mini-PC is up for pre-order now, price cut from $249 to $199. That price includes Microsoft Windows 10 installed but I'd still bet on the 'pre-order introductory price cut' going even deeper in a matter of a few months. I think I would prefer the Pipo KB2 and a wireless mouse if priced similarly, but that Vensmile K8 rival still seems to be unavailable.

This just feels gimmicky… Posted by wazzickle - Fri 14 Oct 2016 19:52 I think it's a great idea. To have everything bar a monitor in a small package like this would be very convenient, a better idea than having, for a example, a separate compute stick, mouse and keyboard to carry round. I suppose it comes with a power brick which would be a drawback, at this point I would say the specs seem good value and if there were a battery-powered version I would probably spring for one. Posted by aniilv - Sat 15 Oct 2016 21:14 this is keyboard without a monitor lold Posted by spolsh - Sun 16 Oct 2016 10:13 cheesemp While at first glance this looks cool i've got to ask why? Surely a stick PC with slim bluetooth keyboard is more practical? This just feels gimmicky… Looks gimmicky too. Nice that it folds into a wallet sized thing, but how big is the power brick you have to cart around too ? Posted by preter_s - Wed 26 Oct 2016 12:36 If one is assuming that there is a monitor lying around at some desk where you intend to bring this thing to, you would think that there would be a proper mouse/keyboard there too? A compute stick would make more sense (& cheaper).

The gang has come up with an open specification that can boost datacentre server performance by up to ten times.  Dubbed the Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI), this is an open forum to provide a high bandwidth, low latency open interface design specification. The open interface will help corporate and cloud data centres to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads. The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Chipzilla is not signing up to the forum, but them it has stayed away from other open standards  and technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z.  It prefers to keep all its technology to itself. However Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, said that with all the AI, machine learning and advanced analytics kicking around,  datacentres can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation.   Tags: Google, IBM, intel Search for: Recent Articles NHS email system borked by one idiot and 120 pedants The NHS’s email system is under pressure after one idiot decided to send an email to everyone.

Woodside’s Amenadiel, the actress has already been promoted to a full-fledged series regular, TVLine has learned. RELATEDFall TV’s First Scoops: A Grey’s Baby, Vampire Diaries‘ New Big Bad and More Early Intel From 18 Returning Series The exclusive image of Helfer alongside Ellis and Woodside underscores the fact that mom essentially falls into the same demo as her two sons. “I heard it put, ‘She’s not really that much older [than Lucifer and Amenadiel],’ the Battlestar vet assured TVLine. “But it will all make sense once you see it.” RELATEDFall TV Preview: Who’s In? Who’s Out? Your Guide to Every Casting Move Helfer — who will debut in Lucifer’s Season 2 premiere on Monday, Sept. 19 at 9/8c — went on to tease that viewers will “very quickly” realize what the deal is with Charlotte, who’s been trapped in Hell for thousands of years by her ex-husband, God, “We’re not going to leave people guessing. There’s been enough of that with the concern that she’s escaped from Hell.” Check out the exclusive first portrait of Hell’s First Family below, then hit the comments with your insta-reaction.

It’s like ‘You see what I have to deal with?!’ Really looking forward to season 2. Reply Litz says: July 20, 2016 at 8:41 AM Am I the only one that thinks that the image would have been better with Tricia standing in the middle instead of Lucifer? Just a wee bit sitcom-y, but I think they could have pulled it off. Reply Nicole Walker says: July 20, 2016 at 9:08 AM Yeah, since she is Mom, she should be the one standing over her two kids but since Luci’s the lead, I’m guessing he gets the top spot ;) Reply Katherine215 says: July 20, 2016 at 9:30 AM Haha, I thought the same thing! The balance is wrong, it’s driving me crazy. I get that he’s the lead and that’s why he’s standing, but ugh, it’s just off balance! Reply Wordsmith says: July 20, 2016 at 10:52 AM Then again, we know that they’re hardly a traditional family, so perhaps the unconventional positioning is a subtle but intentional statement. Reply kate says: July 20, 2016 at 9:14 AM What’s funny, and I’m still in the camp that there is something more to Chloe than meets the eye (I have been in the camp that somewhere in her history is an angel and either she got it activated when she ‘died’) but if there isn’t, well, aren’t we seeing perhaps the reason that Lucifer is so intrigued by Chloe? Reply Anne says: July 20, 2016 at 3:01 PM There has to be something in who her father is; he must be an angel of some kind. Reply Fran says: July 20, 2016 at 10:31 PM That’s a good theory Kate. I was just thinking she looks like Chloe. Reply Linda Cusano says: July 20, 2016 at 11:00 AM She’s too young to play his mother. Reply Matt Webb Mitovich says: July 20, 2016 at 11:03 AM http://tvline.com/2016/04/25/lucifer-season-1-finale-mom-escapes-hell/ Reply John Corbae says: July 20, 2016 at 1:10 PM Demon !! Can be any age she wants. Reply Connie Naylor says: July 20, 2016 at 11:13 AM Love Tricia Helfer. She was so perfect in Battlestar with a nonchalant bad side but with a good side for those things she cared about. Great acting with merely facial expression. Anxious to see the season premiere. So happy she was made a regular. She will have great chemistry with the rest of the cast. Reply James third says: July 20, 2016 at 11:32 AM Nice family pic.I would love to join the cast. Reply Anne says: July 20, 2016 at 11:51 AM Oh I’m so excited!!!!!! She’s going to be such a great addition. Reply Ninamags says: July 20, 2016 at 12:30 PM So first God had a sister and now he has a wife? Reply Joey Padron says: July 20, 2016 at 1:14 PM Great family photo. Excited to see new season this fall and to see Lucifer interact with his mom in new season! Reply Robin Evans says: July 20, 2016 at 1:23 PM All three are looking beautifully devilish! LOL Reply Vishous says: July 20, 2016 at 2:25 PM Is It September YET?! Looks awesome can’t wait to watch how Lucifer deals with MOM & Chloe. Reply Valerie Bowen says: July 20, 2016 at 3:43 PM Definitely looking forward to second season! Reply Tony says: July 20, 2016 at 7:13 PM I love that show Lucifer can’t wait until it comes back.

Down side to young but who cares she is pretty smart and really good actriz Reply Valerie says: July 20, 2016 at 9:05 PM I wanted Sandra Oh. But haven’t been disappointed yet.

Great entertainment, didn’t miss a single episode last season. Keep it coming! Reply Jake says: July 21, 2016 at 4:05 AM Looking forward to the new season.

But by doing away with the franchise dealership model of traditional automotive companies, the San Francisco Bay Area-based company is, in fact, behaving in a way that would liken it to a luxury retailer. The company recently opened a retail space in a Nordstrom in Los Angeles’ shopping area The Grove, and another store space in New York City's artistically inclined Red Hook neighborhood.  Enter Tesla Motor Inc’s vice president of North America sales and marketing, Ganesh Srivats. His name might ring a bell for those familiar with the fashion industry. Srivats was a former retail and strategy executive at Burberry and came to Tesla after 16 years in retail, luxury and strategy. In July 2015, Srivats stepped into his current role and was tasked with advancing the company’s image as a major player in the luxury automotive sector. Srivats addressed attendees Thursday at the third annual 2016 Fashion Tech Forum to discuss how Tesla was advancing the luxury retail model. The Fashion Tech Forum, which was hosted this year at Brooklyn’s Duggal Greenhouse, saw tech CEOs, fashion retailers, designers and engineers sitting side-by-side to participate in discussions on the future of fashion, retail and technology. Among them were major players in e-commerce like Rent the Runway’s CEO and co-founder Jennifer Hyman, and other Silicon Valley heavy hitters like and Snapchat’s director of product revenue Peter Sellis and Intel’s vice president of New Technology Group Sandra E. Lopez. Ganesh Srivats (vice president of North America sales at Tesla Motors) and Piers Fawkes (Founder+President of PSFK2) discuss Tesla's retail strategy at the 2016 Fashion Tech Forum in Brooklyn, New York, Oct. 13, 2016. Photo: Photo Courtesy of Fashion Tech Forum Srivats, who has a robust background in luxury, fashion and technology, said luxury fashion retailers and Tesla have more in common than you might think. Tesla has become the "see now, buy now" brand of luxury car retail, thanks to the immediacy and speed of its output. The company does not sell through dealerships, but through galleries and sleek, modern stores. It’s direct to consumer. “If you’re profit-minded and you have all of these gas-guzzling SUVS that are selling really fast, what incentive do you have to get out there and re-evangelize a new technology that’s going to be hard to sell and when you have all of this other product that moves faster?” Srivats asked, addressing the crowd. “It’s for these reasons that we decided to move into the retail space because we have to control the customer experience, we have to take the ownership to educate people and we have to make sure that experience is physical and real.” A goal in streamlining the vehicle purchasing process in Tesla stores is to have the Tesla stores function very similarly to making an online purchase. Srivats said “product specialists” have replaced salespeople and stores will become more “intuitive.” “One of the things that you will see evolving at Tesla stores in the future is the intuition behind retail. When you go online at home, no one sits next to you and tells you where to click,” he said. “We’re talking about the autonomous store experience as opposed to the assisted store experience.” Shoppers can more or less purchase a Tesla online. Everything, short of actually walking away with the car, can be handled through its site. FindTheCompany | Graphiq “We spend a lot of time thinking about simplification – one touch contracts, one-touch leasing. So you can speed up the process. You can go into your iPhone right now and buy a Tesla. And that’s how we’re going to scale. It's through the diversification of ways in which we are going to reach people,” he said. Tesla, which was founded in 2003, released its first Tesla Roadster in 2008.  As of March, the company had sold nearly 125,000 electric cars around the world. Since then, the company debuted its forthcoming mass-market EV vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, opened its Gigafactory (which will reportedly double the world’s production of lithium batteries, according to Srivats) and purchased SolarCity, the solar energy company, for a cool $2.6 billion in shares in August.  Tesla’s chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has said he has a plan to “accelerate” its electric car production. The goal is 500,000 vehicles rolling out by 2018 and a staggering one million vehicles by 2020. To get there, the company announced this week plans to double the size of its 4.5 million square foot Fremont factory to accommodate the volume of Model S, Model X and, now, the new Model 3.  Here is where Srivats’ background in retail and the Burberry connection comes into play. Burberry, a British luxury heritage brand that brings to mind plaid prints and classic trench coats, has actually been a major player in adopting tech and integrating it into both its brand and its retail strategy. You can hop on Snapchat, for example, and play with custom sponsored Burberry filters and watch its Snap Ads. The British luxury brand was also one of the major design houses, along with Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, to adopt the see now, buy now runway collection, offering its spring 2017 clothing straight off the runways.  Related Stories Tesla Aims To Double Factory Space Tesla To Hold 2 Launch Events This Month “You have to allow for open experimentation and taking chances," Srivats said. "At Burberry, the company was really good at doing that, too." In Tesla's second-quarter update report from August, the car company detailed its plans to open a new retail location “every four days on average during the remainder of Q3 through Q4.” It currently counts close to 200 retail locations.  “We want to be where the customers already are. You want to be where the customers are walking up and down the street, buying their coffee or buying their clothes,” Srivats said. He added: “Between fashion and tech, that’s one thing we simply share: It’s this constant challenge to innovate and to stay ahead of that curve.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Mr Justice Paul McDermott on Friday appointed solicitor Mr Hugh Kane of Kane Tuohy as receiver on an interim basis by way of equitable execution over shares in the Belize-based Universal Assets Ltd, which the court heard owner of a mansion called 'Nirvana' located on a five acre site in Craughwell Co Galway. Mr McGeever with an address at Clontarf Dublin 3, has claimed 'Nirvana' is held in trust for his daughters Shanelle and Renee who live in Australia. The application to appoint Mr Kane was brought on behalf of businessman Mr James Byrne as part of his attempts to recover a judgment of €1.2m obtained against the Mr McGeever. Mr Byrne had obtained judgment against Mr McGeever and his company in 2014 over a failed deal to purchase several apartments in Dubai sold by Mr McGeever's KMM Intel Properties. Seeking the appointment of Mr Kane, whose firm acts for Mr Byrne, Gary McCarthy SC said the application was being made to protect Mr Byrne's position. The shares in Universal Assets, counsel said were owned by a Mr Robert Kearney. Counsel said Mr McGeever is the beneficial owner of the shares. Counsel said while 'Nirvana' has been neglected in recent years it was a "magnificent property" that had been lavishly decorated. Mr McGeever has claimed he manages the property and has power of attorney, renewed, every year over the company. He had claimed the shares in the company are held in trust on behalf of his children and despite being given many opportunities to hand over evidence of the trust he has failed to do so Counsel said it was clear Mr McKeever had sought "to hide behind an offshore company" for the purpose of avoiding creditors. The appointment of Mr Kane as receiver was sought so matters could be fully investigated by him. The application was opposed by Mr McGeever's lawyers. They had argued there was no rush to make the appointment and Mr McGeever was seeking a valuation on Nirvana in ease of the court. . In his ruling Mr Justice McDermott said the justice of the situation required that a receiver be appointed. In his ruling the judge noted that no deed of trust had been provided to Mr Byrne's lawyers nor had details about the trust nor has the identities of the trustees been provided. The matter was adjourned to October 25th. Mr Byrne has also proceedings seeking Mr McGeevers attachment and committal to prison over his alleged failure to fully disclose details about his assets The application, which has been opposed, has been before the courts on several previous occasions. That action has also been adjourned to October 25th to allow Mr McGeever to take steps including transfer shares in Universal Assets to Mr Byrne. Last April Mr McGeever pleaded guilty before Galway Circuit Court, and received a two years suspended sentence, for wasting garda time. He had claimed he was kidnapped by creditors who held him for eight months before he turned up on a roadside and was picked up by a passing motorist.   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition 40 % of garda budget went towards the policing of public order issues 'Public order problem in County Leitrim' claims Supt Protest outside Ballinamore Post Office on High Street in September this year.

Khronos, Mesa, Standards & Conformance / Certification: Open Source, Open Standards Written by Michael Larabel in Standards on 15 October 2016 at 09:10 AM EDT. 13 Comments The past week or two in our forums and elsewhere there's been a lot of comments about Khronos' conformance testing for OpenGL 4.4/4.5 with the Mesa drivers finally reaching that point, concern over Khronos' fees being prohibitive for open-source projects (particularly in cases like Nouveau where it's community driven without a main corporate backer), and some FUD related to this matter. I've now received some clarification from The Khronos Group to lay these concerns to rest. For those not reading the comments in the Phoronix Forums, Reddit, and elsewhere, the conformance process has been raising concerns among some readers with the Mesa drivers having not exposed OpenGL 4.4/4.5 yet officially (though last night Intel officially exposed GL 4.5, as of writing RadeonSI and Nouveau NVC0 still show GL 4.3 while they implement all GL 4.4 / 4.5 extensions). Some of the Git commits and mailing list messages about GL 4.4/4.5 have mentioned "conformance" and the "CTS" (conformance test suite) plus this PDF and links to the Khronos adopter page has also been circulating that shows costs for OpenGL 4.4/4.5 conformance fees as $25~30k USD, which led to a number of concerns by users wondering if they needed to pass this costly process to advertise GL 4.4/4.5 or face trademark issues, what would happen in cases like Nouveau where they aren't backed by a Khronos member company, whether Khronos is trying to shake down developers, and all sorts of other stuff. This hasn't been a problem before for Mesa's OpenGL implementation since Khronos only rolled out their conformance program for GL with OpenGL 4.4 and 4.5. Khronos also maintains adopter conformance tests for OpenGL ES too. With seeing talk among users on this topic continue and even some suggesting a crowdfunding campaign so Nouveau could have the finances to pass the conformance tests, I set out to get some clarification from Khronos. Khronos President Neil Trevett was able to lay these concerns to rest. Long story short, it's not posing a problem for open-source projects. Trevett explained, "Khronos always welcomes bona fide open source implementations of any of its APIs - and obviously everyone wins if they can be officially conformant. So - we typically will waive the Adopters fee for any open source organization who wants to be officially conformant - so they can access the tests and make a submission." They are aware of Mesa's situation and are working with them. If there are any other open-source developers (or e.g. Nouveau developers interested in conformance but without a Khronos contact), let me know and happy to put you in touch. It was also pointed out on this page, Khronos does back up their open-source project support, "Non-commercial implementations of Khronos specifications, including open source projects, often cannot afford to become a Khronos Member or Adopter. Khronos has often waived Membership and Adopters fees to bona fide open source implementers of Khronos specifications that play an important role in the API ecosystem." Also exciting is that based upon the success of Vulkan's more open approach with those tests being open-source, etc, Khronos is looking at putting their other API conformance tests as open-source too for making them more accessible to developers. Basically, all appears well on the Khronos front and concerns raised through various portals recently about conformance fees and processes are not of issue to open-source projects like Mesa. Just another reason to love this industry standards body and their mutual support for open-source. 13 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Minyanville US STOCK MARKET, BIG PICTURE VIEW By Scutify Oct 14, 2016 4:12 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Because perspective is everything, let's once again get some big picture perspective... S&P 500 is outside the lower fork line (again the Fork being a novelty, but the line being real) but above critical support. Bears would call this an overthrow to the upside and massive bull trap. We can call it an intact bull market above support and a very bearish market should that support be lost. We'll throw in other time frames on the SPX for reference. When the weekly chart crossed those two moving averages up and then got through resistance (now support), it went bullish. Simple. SPX daily chart is at the wedge bottom, but serious support is lower still. Dow egg is in its little nest, with Mommy Bird Janet Yellen sitting atop of it keeping it warm and comfy incubating it for years on end after Daddy Bird flew the coop. Let's put aside for a moment that the bond market is making initial signs of disrupting Mommy Bird. Above the solid and dotted green lines... bullish. Below them, scrambled eggs. Nasdaq 100 is in blue sky. So if you're getting good and bearish, let's just remember that. The first step to a technical bearish situation - a monthly close below 4816.35 - has not even been taken. And that would only be a small step. Semiconductor Index continues to target what it targets. I believe the target was 870 based on the short-term pattern, but we have had 930 in view since early 2014 (the year that Semis were supposedly imploding) with the 750 target long ago put in the books. I am cautious about owning this stuff after taking profit all around (except Intel), but if the market only corrects and does not go big picture bearish a pullback here could be another buying opportunity. Finally, last and least, is the Russell 2000. The reason I say least is that these stocks have theleast in market cap (among the headline indexes), the least reward vs. risk proposition (see the weekly leadership chart below) and the least attractive monthly chart. This wild man has already done a 38% Fib retrace, bounced back hard and retains a pattern that can only be described as gross as long as it is below 1300. We did measure out a still unregistered target of around 1350 for this years ago, by the way. That was based on the giant 'Cup' formed from 2007 to 2011. However, here we can recall the HUI Gold Bugs index, on which I had a similar Cup measuring to near 900. That one proved to be a, ah, bad target. So there's that caveat. Here's the weekly 'leadership' indicator chart. This has guided us on Small Cap leadership in 2016 (green dotted uptrend channel) but greatly increased risk relative to Large Caps (gold downtrend channel). Again, simple. As for rolling the above into the current view, it's a smooth transition. The stock market has been bullish since the signal was made on the S&P 500 (with the weekly EMA 20 crossing above the EMA 50) and the Brexit hysteria failed to be anything other than short-term bullish. Here is another view of the second chart above, adding some long-term perspective with similar signals and would-be signal. This has so far turned out to be more like 1998 and 2011 than 2001 and 2008. Very simply, the bulls have the ball, period. The bears want that ball and all they have to do is crack the big picture support parameters in order to make things not just bearish, but potentially extremely so, given that the recent breaks upward to blue sky in many indexes would then be painted as an epic final suck in on a bullish overthrow. So how about a little patience as things play out. The short-term theme has been for a pullback to test major support. Let's let that play out before making any grand calls.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Eurocom updates Sky MX5 R2 laptop with Pascal cards by Eric Frederiksen  4:53 PM on October 14, 2016 Looking at the Sky MX5 R2, one has to wonder if the designers at Eurocom understands what "laptop" means to most people. They're definitely stretching the definition. The company released the original Sky MX5 last fall with a Nvidia GTX 970M card and Intel's Core i7-6700HQ CPU on board. This revision adds Nvidia's 10-series graphics cards to keep the lineup fresh. The R2 revision updates little aside from the graphics card, which is now Nvidia's GTX 1070 with 8GB of GDDR5 VRAM. The GTX 1070 powers what looks to be the same 15.6" display, which is available either as a G-Sync-compatible 1920x1080 IPS panel or a 4K 3840x2160 screen with a 48Hz refresh rate. The system also sports an RGB LED backlit keyboard this time around. Despite packing the same-size battery as the previous model, the Sky MX5 R2 also promises about 60 percent more battery life over its predecessor. While the original MX5 weighed in at 5.51 pounds, its replacement adds a bit of bulk for a total weight of 5.72 lbs (or 2.6kg). The MX5 R2 is also about 10% thicker at 1.13" (2.9cm), while keeping the same 15.16" width and 10.66" depth (38.5 cm x 27.1 cm) of the original. The highly-configurable system is available starting at $1499 on Eurocom's site.

NEW YORK: US stocks opened higher on Friday as a trio of leading banks beat analyst third quarter earnings forecasts despite the tough low interest rate environment. The three -- Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- all saw net profits fall as low rates pared lending margins, but they beat forecasts from analysts, driving their shares higher in early trade. About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 percent to 18,229.53. The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.6 percent at 2,146.22, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7 percent to 5,251.99. Citigroup shares led the three reporting banks with a 2.5 percent gain, Wells Fargo rose 0.5 percent and JPMorgan 1.3 percent. Other banks yet to report for the quarter rode the wave higher: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both jumped more than 3 percent while Bank of America rose 2.2 percent. Also helping the market were fresh economic indicators pointing to a resilient economy; both retail sales and producer prices picked up in September. Underpinning that was a jump in key consumer and producer price indexes in China, with the producer price index showing the first year-on-year gain in almost five years. Among other stocks, two partially China plays. Intel gained 1.6 percent and Caterpillar 1.4 percent. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices surged 7.5 percent, helped by a trading upgrade from Credit Suisse. US retail sales rose in September after a decline in August, turning the corner after a summer in which consumers had shown a slackening appetite, according to the Commerce Department. Advance estimates for the month were $459.8 billion, representing an increase of 0.6 percent over August and 2.7 percent over the same month last year. The result matched analyst expectations. Sales were down for the month in department stores, electronics and appliance retailers. Spending rose on furniture, building materials, and gasoline. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said that on closer inspection the results were cause for concern. "A rebound in US retail sales in September masks worrying signs of a slacking-off in the underlying trend in consumer spending to the worst for over three years, suggesting the economy is struggling to pull out of the malaise seen in the first half of the year," he wrote in a client note. "The September upturn leaves total sales 0.7 percent higher in the third quarter, less than half of the 1.5 percent expansion seen in the second quarter."  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

"I stay focused, since this is when the fundamentals really come to the fore and direct the overall direction of the market," the "Mad Money" host said. With this in mind, Cramer outlined the stocks and events on his radar next week: Monday: Fed's Stanley Fischer Speaks, Bank of America, IBM, Netflix Fed's vice chairman Fischer: As Fischer has been a proponent for a rate hike in the past, every time he opens his mouth the market gets hit. Cramer will be prepared for Fischer's speech on Monday to take stocks down. Bank of America: Even though the stock is cheap, Cramer worries that the company may have gotten ahead of itself, thanks to the earnings of JPMorgan and Citigroup. Netflix: At this point, the expectations for Netflix are so low Cramer thinks it may be able to beat them. "Longer-term I remain a believer in Netflix, but I accept there can be hiccups along the way," Cramer said. Tuesday: Domino's, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Intel Domino's: Cramer expects the company to deliver, but he is concerned that it might not rally too much on a good number because it has had such a run going into earnings. Goldman Sachs: With trading and corporate finance right in Goldman's sweet spot, Cramer sees the value in Goldman. If the Fed ultimately decides to raise rates, this could unlock further value, too. Wednesday: Abbott Laboratories, Morgan Stanley, American Express, Lam Research Abbott: The company is in the process of closing its acquisition with St. Jude Medical, a move Cramer interpreted as meaning it is planning to dominate the medical space. He expects the company to have good things to say. Lam Research: Lam attempted to merge with KLA-Tencor, but the deal was blocked by the government. Cramer is interested to see how Samsung's woes will affect the company, given that Samsung is the largest buyer of semiconductor equipment. "It's a fabulous company, but I do worry that Samsung will have to cut back on orders," Cramer said. Thursday: American Airlines, Illinois Tool Works, Walgreens, Verizon, Microsoft, Schlumberger American Airlines: This stock could continue to rally if the company pledges not to expand its fleet to add capacity. Cramer will be watching. Microsoft: As margin expansion is a possibility, Cramer wants to know how much of the business is based on the cloud now that it has purchased LinkedIn. The more investors learn about it, the more they may want to buy the stock. Schlumberger: Cramer expects Schlumberger to provide clarity on how real the recent oil rally to $50 is. He wants to know if it is bullish long term. If so, oil could break out, otherwise the inverse could occur. Friday: McDonald's, General Electric, Honeywell McDonald's: "We know that McDonald's has become a 'what have you done for me lately' stock, and the answer is not very much," Cramer said. Even with these challenges, Cramer sticks by the stock because of its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. General Electric: With both the aerospace and the oil and gas businesses challenged lately, Cramer hopes GE decides to focus more on returning capital, and less on the weaknesses of those businesses. Unfortunately, he would not be surprised if GE's forecast causes analysts to cut numbers. He's in it for the long term, though. Questions for Cramer?

One of the problems with such computers is that you need to also carry around input devices like a keyboard and mouse (assuming there aren’t any where you plan to use the system). This shortcoming has led to some creative experimentation among device manufacturers. Acooo’s oneBoard PRO+ is a perfect example. Stuffed into an otherwise unassuming mechanical keyboard is a quad-core Android PC. It’s a clever concept but what if you’re extremely pressed for real estate? That’s where something like the Vensmile K8 mini PC comes into play. As Liliputing notes, the device hardly looks any different than the flexible, rubber-style keyboards that have been available for years. But upon closer inspection, you’ll see that there’s a solid section on the right that serves as a touchpad. The dual-purpose touchpad is also the chassis for a tiny desktop computer consisting of a quad-core Intel Atom x5-Z8300 (Cherry Trail) processor clocked at 1.44GHz (Burst to 1.84GHz), 4GB of DDR3 RAM and 64GB of eMMC flash memory. You also get dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 as well as HDMI out, VGA out, a USB 3.0 port, a USB 2.0 port, an expansion card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack – all running Windows 10 Home. GeekBuying is now accepting pre-orders with plans to ship later this month. Expect to pay $199.99 or the opportunity.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the US and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at US Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 % , at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose 3.10 dollars, or 1.9 % , to 170.52 dollars after the High Court in London threw out a one billion dollar lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 % from 1.75 % . Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to 59.80 dollars and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to 77.21 dollars. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to 57.42 dollars while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 % , to 37.45 dollars and Apple picked up 68 cents to 117.66 dollars. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 % , to 14.48 dollars. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 % , to 16.88 dollars after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it is not interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 % of its value since October 5 on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped 3.64 dollars, or 5.2 % , to 74.27 dollars. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost 1.39 dollars, or 3.7 % , and closed at a three-year low of 36.49 dollars. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank 2.13 dollars, or 2.1 % , to 98.50 dollars.

The listing comes less than a month after he was arrested on charges he attacked a man and his elderly father. He was cut by the team shortly thereafter. Listed on Oct. 10, the home is already in pending status. It has four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms and sits on a 4,100-square-foot lot in the city's Rivermark neighborhood. The neighborhood is near the headquarters of major Silicon Valley employers such as Cisco, Intel, and Nvidia. It's also less than 2 miles away from Levi's Stadium, home of the 49ers. Built in 2003, the two-story, Contemporary Spanish -- style home features hardwood flooring, new carpeting, and custom paint. The living room has a surround-sound speaker system, a gas fireplace, and light-filtering window shades. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet and a master bathroom with dual sinks, marble flooring, and a frameless shower. The kitchen includes granite countertops, white cabinets, stainless-steel appliances, and an island. Miller bought the home in mid-2014 for $1.4 million. Miller, 29, was drafted in 2011 by the 49ers for a fullback position. He recorded 62 rushing yards on 28 carries and 734 receiving yards on 76 catches, for a total of four career touchdowns. He was set to switch positions and become a tight end in 2016, under new head coach Chip Kelly. Miller was arrested in early September on multiple counts of assault and battery, after he allegedly tried to barge into an elderly couple's hotel room in San Francisco and got in a fight with a 70-year-old man and his son, who was staying next door. The team released him from his contract later that day. In 2015, Miller pleaded no contest to charges he pushed his then-girlfriend into a wall and smashed her cellphone.

Previously, 10G networks – offering data transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second – have been the domain of the enterprise. Despite the 10GBASE-T standard emerging back in 2006, the price of compatible switches and adapters meant that anyone seeking to upgrade their Gigabit kit would be facing at least a $2000 bill. However, affordable 10G kit is now trickling down into the consumer realm. It’s still an investment – make no mistake – but we’re now at the point that gamers and data hoarders considering a networking refresh should take a serious look at 10G. If you’re in that group, here’s a rundown of ten excellent prospects to get your 10G network up and running. 1. ASUS XG-U2008 10G Network Switch With the cheapest business-class network switch weighing in around $800, connecting PCs, NAS devices and storage servers to a 10G network is an expensive business. Until now. The ASUS XG-U2008 10G network switch is priced for prosumers at just $249. At that price, there are compromises for sure – the device is unmanaged (so is plug and play, without any fancy network management features) and offers just two 10G ports alongside a further eight that run at Gigabit speeds. With the cheapest business-class network switch weighing in around $800, connecting PCs, NAS devices and storage servers to a 10G network is an expensive business. Until now. The ASUS XG-U2008 10G network switch is priced for prosumers at just $249. At that price, there are compromises for sure – the device is unmanaged (so is plug and play, without any fancy network management features) and offers just two 10G ports alongside a further eight that run at Gigabit speeds.   Handily, the switch automatically configures each port depending on the device connected and the twin 10G ports include LED indicators that tells you what speed the connected cable supports. An optional 10″ rack mount kit allows you to co-locate the switch in an AV or server cabinet. At $249, the ASUS XG-U2008 offers incredible value, ensuring 10G networking is a realistic prospect for consumers. 2. NETGEAR ProSAFE 8-Port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Switch (XS708T-100NES) If two ports aren’t going to cut it in your home network, then you’ll need to invest in a higher end switch that will offer 8 ports. The NETGEAR ProSAFE 8-Port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Switch (XS708T-100NES) is possibly your best option, priced at $949.99 (now you see why that ASUS switch is such good value). Alongside those 8 10G ports, you’ll also benefit from a swathe of business-class features that you’ll find on managed switches. They include VLAN, QoS, IGMP and MLD snooping, IPv4 & IPv6 Static Routing, Link Aggregation and ACLs that allow you to segment and secure your network.Alongside those 8 10G ports, you’ll also benefit from a swathe of business-class features that you’ll find on managed switches. They include VLAN, QoS, IGMP and MLD snooping, IPv4 & IPv6 Static Routing, Link Aggregation and ACLs that allow you to segment and secure your network.   3. Startech Cat 6a Ethernet Cables Of course, laying out a 10G network isn’t just about network switches and PCIe adapters. You’re going to need to ensure your network cabling is also up to scratch and for most, that’ll mean replacing Cat 5e Ethernet cables with the faster Cat 6a standard. Cat 5e works really well for Gigabit speeds, but for anything faster, Cat 6a (or Cat 7, see below) is where it’s at.You may be aware that between Cat 5e and Cat 6a, there’s another standard – Cat 6. This will support 10G speeds but note that maximum speeds are only supported up to 55 meters. Cat 6a doubles data transmission bandwidth, from 250 to 500 MHz, meaning that you’ll be able to run cable up to 100 meters or so. They’re also usually shielded, so should perform well. On the flipside, you’ll find Cat 6a cables are a little more expensive than Cat 6 cables (a premium of around 20% or so) but I think they’re worth the investment unless you’re on a strict budget.You may well have a favourite cable manufacturer – I’ve picked out Startech as their kit is usually great quality and won’t break the bank. They offer Cat 6a cables in lengths of 0.3m (a foot) up to 10.7m (35 feet) in black, blue or grey. They’re snagless and shielded with a wire gauge of 25 AWG.No doubt, if you did around Amazon or eBay, you’ll find cheaper unbranded or generic options. Your mileage here, with regard to quality, may vary – be sure to go with a product that has a good amount of positive reviews. 4. Cable Matters Cat6a Ethernet Cable (100 foot reel) If you’re wiring up a whole house, or part of your house, then buying longer reels of Ethernet cable is going to be more cost efficient than using shorter, pre-made cables. Of course, that means you’ll have all of the fun of terminating the cable with wall plates and RJ-45 connectors (see below) but once you get the hang of it, terminating Ethernet cables is really straightforward. A quick search on Amazon finds this 100 foot reel of Cat 6a cable from Cable Matters that is reviewed really well. It’s priced at just $24.99 (at the time of writing) with a 200 foot reel priced at just $44.99. Again, the cable is shielded with a guage of 26 AWG. Need more? Well the same company offers a 1000 ft reel for $249.99. 5. AmazonBasics Cat 7 Cable While you’ll readily find Cat 7 cables available on the market today, you probably find that Cat 6a is more than sufficient to meet the needs and speeds of 10G networks. The Cat 7 “standard” is not officially recognised by the TIA/EIA but is designed with even stricter specifications for crosstalk and system noise, via enhanced cable shielding and other methods. As you’d expect, Cat 7 cables are pricier than Cat 6a but with minimal additional benefits in terms of speed or drop length. However, those wiring up a whole house for Ethernet may well be happy investing in the “best” cable available. Before splashing too much cash, however, you can check out the difference with Amazon’s reasonably cheap CAT 7 cables. They’re available in runs of 3 feet ($6.99) up to 25 feet ($16.99) which isn’t a lot to spend on an experiment. 6. Startech 10G PCIe Network Card (ST10000SPEX)You have your switch and your cables sorted out. You now need something to plug them into! Startech’s ST10000SPEX 10G Network Card adapter slots into a spare PCIe slot on your PC’s motherboard. Priced at $248.99 (at the time of writing) it’s certainly a good value option. It’s built on a Tehuti Networks controller, which may not please every network admin out there (I generally lean towards Intel chipsets, personally) but in terms of bang for the buck, it’s hard to complain. 7. Intel X540-T2 Converged Network Adapter If you’re a stickler for Intel chipsets driving the bits around your network, you’ll need to spend a fair amount more than the Startech model on the Intel X540-T2 Converged Network Adapter (or one of the OEM variants rocking the same chipset).   Expect at pay at least $400 or so for the adapter card from a mainstream vendor, or once again, if you dig around you can find marketplace vendors on eBay and Amazon selling OEM cards for much less – again be wary and check those seller reviews.The additional outlay will get you twin Ethernet ports – great for failover support and, reportedly, a little less latency than experienced with Realtek-powered cards. 8. QNAP TS-831X 8-Bay NAS One of the most useful tasks for a 10G network is moving data to or from a centralised storage device, such as a NAS. Higher-end NAS devices with 10G adapters are becoming increasingly common and the QNAP TS-831X is a great example.It’s an 8-bay NAS supporting 8 or 16 GB RAM ($899 or $999 respectively) and is powered by an ARM Cortex-A15 processor – not the highest spec CPU in the QNAP NAS range, but good enough.With a swathe of first and third-party apps available from QNAP’s app respository, the TS-831X makes for a fabulous prosumer or small business NAS. 9. ASUSTOR AS7008TNAS Those of the Synology NAS persuasion have a little less choice overall, with regard to 10G – options are available but, at the time of writing, they’re either due a replacement model or are very expensive. So, we turn to ASUSTOR’s AS7008T for competition with QNAP. This 8-bay NAS doesn’t ship with an integrated 10G adapter, but can be upgraded during installation (see below). Priced around $1400, it’s definitely not a budget model, but it’s powered by an Intel Core i3 CPU which provides plenty of horsepower for media transcoding and other advanced NAS features. 10. ASUSTOR 10 Gb Dual Port Network Expansion Card/QNAP 10G Network Cards Upgrading an ASUSTOR or QNAP NAS for 10G networking is very straightforward (as long as it’s a compatible model). ASUSTOR’s 10 Gb Dual Port Network Expansion Card is priced at $499 and provides twin 10G capable Ethernet sockets. It’s supported on a number of ASUSTOR NAS models, including the AS7008T / AS7010T / AS7009RD / AS7012RD / AS7009RDX and AS7012RDX.Over in the QNAP camp, the choice is even more comprehensive. QNAP offers a range of 10G networking accessories that start at just $138 for the single port 10 Gigabit SFP+ Network PCIe Expansion Card, up to $399 for the dual port variant.As always, be sure to check the manufacturer’s website to ensure the card you select is compatible with your NAS. As you can see, while 10G networking still requires somewhat of an investment to elevate your data transfer speeds to the next level, manufacturers are introducing an increasing amount of kit with prosumer-level performance and pricing to match. If you’re wiring up you home with Ethernet cables, it’s well worth ensuring that you select cabling that will future-proof your network. For media, photography and video enthusiasts and other creative types, the time is right to start thinking about at your next network upgrade. shares Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Reddit Email Subscribe Join the mailing list Sign up to our mailing list and you will receive the latest news, reviews and how to guides delivered directly to your inbox.

The new standard, called Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI), is an open forum to provide a high bandwidth, low latency open interface design specification. The open interface will help corporate and cloud data centres to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads. The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s data centres can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive US stocks rise as banks and tech companies lead the way Friday Oct 14, 2016 at 2:21 PM Oct 14, 2016 at 2:21 PM Marley Jay The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are slightly higher Friday. Technology stocks are rising as investors were pleased with economic reports from the U.S. and China. Financial stocks are up after several major U.S. banks reported strong third-quarter results, while energy companies are down as the price of oil falls.  KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,179 as of 1:10 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,138. The Nasdaq composite edged up 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,224. The Dow was up as much as 162 points earlier. US ECONOMY HOPES: The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger.   FindTheCompany | Graphiq The Labor Department said producer prices rose in September as the cost of energy and food increased, but inflation appeared to remain limited. CHINA INFLATION: Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, while the national producer price index, which measures inflation, rose for the first time since 2012. That could result in factories in China starting to pass rising costs to their consumers. Stocks fell Thursday as a report on imports and exports caused investors to worry that China's economic is weakening. Some of the largest losses went to tech companies, as China is a major market for them. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.43 while Intel rose 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.47 and Apple picked up 52 cents to $117.50. BANKS MAKE IT COUNT: JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup's results were better than investors expected. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, set aside more money to cover loans that could go bad, but it reported a big gain in deposits and originated more mortgages. Citigroup reported better results from its consumer banking business. Their stocks did not move much, but the reports may have raised investor hopes for the banks that will report their results next week. Citigroup added 9 cents to $48.57. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs gained $2.67, or 1.6 percent, to $170.09 and Morgan Stanley gained 32 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.06. DEPARTMENT STORE BLUES: While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.42, or 3.1 percent, to $43.70 and Macy's fell $1.30, or 3.5 percent, to $35.50. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.76 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, which lets banks make bigger profits from lending. PRINTER JAM: Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. The company is trying to sell more high-end PCs, office printers and 3D printing systems as more people use smartphones and store documents and photos online. HP stock lost 48 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $14.67. INFOSYS IN TROBLE: Business consulting services company Infosys again cut its annual revenue projections after its second-quarter sales fell short of estimates. The stock shed 91 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $15.74. QUEASY: Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.13, or 3 percent, to $36.75 and drug and generic ingredient maker Perrigo fell $1.76, or 2 percent, to $86.14. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil gave up 36 cents to $50.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 38 cents to $51.65 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. EOG Resources sank 71 cents to $94.79 and Devon Energy declined 48 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.42. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 103.91 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.10995 from $1.1053. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week.

The interface will help corporate and cloud data centres and CDNs to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads. The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available by the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm, it’s clear that today’s datacenters can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation ” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2014, file photo, American flags fly in front of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are falling early Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, and following global markets lower after a steep drop in China’s exports, a troubling sign for the second-largest economy in the world. Banks and mining companies are taking some of the largest losses. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks are slightly higher Friday. Technology stocks are rising as investors were pleased with economic reports from the U.S. and China. Financial stocks are up after several major U.S. banks reported strong third-quarter results, while energy companies are down as the price of oil falls. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,179 as of 11:10 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,138. The Nasdaq composite edged up 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,224. The Dow was up as much as 162 points earlier. VIDEOS TOP JOBS US ECONOMY HOPES: The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. The Labor Department said producer prices rose in September as the cost of energy and food increased, but inflation appeared to remain limited. CHINA INFLATION: Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, while the national producer price index, which measures inflation, rose for the first time since 2012. That could result in factories in China starting to pass rising costs to their consumers. Stocks fell Thursday as a report on imports and exports caused investors to worry that China's economic is weakening. Some of the largest losses went to tech companies, as China is a major market for them. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.43 while Intel rose 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.47 and Apple picked up 52 cents to $117.50. BANKS MAKE IT COUNT: JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup's results were better than investors expected. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, set aside more money to cover loans that could go bad, but it reported a big gain in deposits and originated more mortgages. Citigroup reported better results from its consumer banking business. Their stocks did not move much, but the reports may have raised investor hopes for the banks that will report their results next week. Citigroup added 9 cents to $48.57. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs gained $2.67, or 1.6 percent, to $170.09 and Morgan Stanley gained 32 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.06. DEPARTMENT STORE BLUES: While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.42, or 3.1 percent, to $43.70 and Macy's fell $1.30, or 3.5 percent, to $35.50. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.76 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, which lets banks make bigger profits from lending. PRINTER JAM: Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. The company is trying to sell more high-end PCs, office printers and 3D printing systems as more people use smartphones and store documents and photos online. HP stock lost 48 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $14.67. INFOSYS IN TROBLE: Business consulting services company Infosys again cut its annual revenue projections after its second-quarter sales fell short of estimates. The stock shed 91 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $15.74. QUEASY: Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.13, or 3 percent, to $36.75 and drug and generic ingredient maker Perrigo fell $1.76, or 2 percent, to $86.14. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil gave up 36 cents to $50.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 38 cents to $51.65 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. EOG Resources sank 71 cents to $94.79 and Devon Energy declined 48 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.42. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 103.91 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.10995 from $1.1053. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Students are stabbed at Utah school, but 'this was not retaliatory' LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons State audit dings University of Utah athletic department over hiring, travel and equipment; probe fi Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online.

Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 percent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 percent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 percent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen.

The bottom image is a reflection on a glass surface. (REUTERS/Albert Gea) Apple’s MacBook line is in dire need of a refresh. But the update should satisfy the Mac faithful when it finally arrives. How dire has it become? "They should have done it a long time ago,” Ryan Smith, editor in chief of tech site Anandtech, told FoxNews.com in an email, referring to the MacBook Pro line. “Most models are full price yet years out of date, and that makes buying old models bad investments for consumers,” he added.   Which is what most product review sites have been telling readers for months. Laptopmag.com is just one example: “5 Reasons You'd Be a Fool to Buy a MacBook Now,” is the headline of an article that lists reason No.1 as: “The current MacBooks are extremely outdated.” Related: Is Samsung's loss a win for Apple and Google phones? Google takes aim at Apple and Samsung with Pixel phones iPhone 7 slammed as having 'worst' battery life compared to rivals The most decrepit of the aging MacBooks is the Pro line, which hasn’t seen a major redesign in almost five years. The tardiness of the updates is not just impacting consumers. “I'm hearing of developers considering abandoning the platform because it interferes with their [development] tools,” Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, told FoxNews.com. MacBook Pro owners are particularly sensitive to performance, another area where Apple is falling behind. “A new MacBook Pro is very much needed to catch up on GPU [graphics processing unit] performance and efficiency,” Daniel Matte, an analyst at market research Canalys, told FoxNews.com. The 15-inch MacBook Pro needs a new Intel CPU chip too: it’s still saddled with an Intel processor that’s two generations behind the chipmaker’s newest “Kaby Lake” processors. When? The most pressing question is, of course, when will the new MacBooks arrive. "Production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air," Rhoda Alexander, director, tablet and notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, told FoxNews.com Alexander expects the new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to launch by the end of this month. That, however, doesn’t leave much time as we’re about halfway through October now. Lots of new features expected The refreshed MacBook Air line should include new USB-C connector technology (now found on the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook), according to a report from Bloomberg in August. The redesigned MacBook Pro, meanwhile, will be thinner and have a flatter keyboard, Bloomberg said. The most widely cited (and speculated) MacBook Pro feature is a new-fangled, OLED display-based "dynamic" set of function keys that shows a virtual representation of the keys based on the task the user is doing. Other likely features for the MacBook Pros are the addition of USB-C ports and Touch ID fingerprint identity sensors, possibly next to the new function key display. Also, a new rumor – deemed “questionable” by MacRumors – cites a keyboard that uses an e-ink display underneath the keys that changes dynamically to fit the needs of the user. If the technology appears at all in MacBooks or in Mac keyboards it wouldn’t happen until later, possibly 2018. Questionable rumors aside, don’t hold your breath for Intel’s latest and greatest processor in the new MacBooks. "Given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel's] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely," IHS Markit’s Alexander said, adding that it's possible that Apple opts for previous-generation Skylake chips. Canalys’ Daniel Matte adds that Apple is likely to include an option for AMD's latest "Polaris" graphics processors in the new MacBook Pros. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Tech CEO who vowed to murder Donald Trump with a sniper rifle resigns 2 Microsoft rolls out Black Friday deals 3 Smartphone residue says a lot about you, including your secrets 4 US Navy denies software piracy in $596 million lawsuit 5 Secret software in some Android phones sent data to China, experts warn See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

The researchers said Europe can no longer ignore the growing threats of Islamist terror, as well as border security issues influenced by Europe's migrant crisis. © Photo: Pixabay 'Costly Affair': Europe 'Has No Money to Create Common Army'Western European nations are to increase their military investment by over 1 percent in 2016. That's according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), an influential global think tank researching political & military conflict, based in London. It marks a significant break from the past. EU member states spending on the military in 2015 totalled US$223 billion, almost 15 percent smaller than in 2007. The researchers point to the very public fallout in the wake of terrorist attacks such as the bombings and shootings in Paris last November and the Brussels airport bombing in March. European leaders like French President François Hollande faced angry accusations that he had not done enough to prevent the recurrence of such attacks. In the IISS report on military strategy and spending in Europe, the think tank noted that not since the Cold War, has European security become such a priority for European policy makers. "Across the continent, policymakers were in 2015 preoccupied with the uncomfortable reality that while the threats and risks to European security had increased during recent years, the means to address them had not recovered from the long cycle of defense cuts that began after the Cold War and accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis." © Photo: Pixabay More 'Lone Wolf' Attacks Likely in Europe Amid Intel Chaos - ExpertThe report added that the proliferation of Daesh, also known as IS/ISIL, and so-called "lone wolf" terror attacks has "brought conflict and a disregard for the established principles of peace and security back to a continent where it was thought that such issues were a feature of the past." "The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) counts among its personnel many foreign fighters, thousands of whom hold Western passports. Returnees, now trained and experienced, constitute a terrorism threat to Europe." Another key dilemma influencing the recent increase in military and security spending, is Europe's ongoing migrant crisis. More than 1.5 million people arrived in Europe in 2015 alone, many being refugees fleeing death and persecution in conflict zones such as Iraq and Syria. "Continuing conflict in Africa and the Middle East has led to significant refugee flows, as countries in the region edge towards failure and collapse," the IISS report noted. Indeed, as Federica Mogherini, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, argued in May 2015: "The security situation in the EU's direct neighborhood has deteriorated significantly: the concurrency, intensity, frequency and complexity of conflicts and crises in the neighborhood have increased'. Bastian Giegerich: Share guns and sovereignty — armaments cooperation in Europe https://t.co/EIaFn3iEg8 — Adam Ward (@AdamWardIISS) August 26, 2016​ 2016 has also brought the challenge of the UK's impending exit from the EU. Currently, the UK and France are Europe's only nuclear states. Without the UK, France will have to shoulder the burden of being the EU's only full-spectrum military power. The UK's exit also robs the bloc of its biggest-spending military force. Three months after the UK voted for Brexit, EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, indicated he wants to press ahead with proposals for an EU Army, supported by the defense ministers of Spain, Germany, Italy and France. However, it is deeply controversial to many members, including the UK. There are concerns an EU Army may undermine and take away resources from NATO, which the UK remains a member of. EU defense ministers are expected to hold talks on the defense plans in Brussels in November, before presenting a more detailed strategy to EU leaders at a summit in December. ...

Comments Computerworld | Oct 14, 2016 7:34 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Windows PCs Windows 10 Windows 10 Comments Glitches, hiccups, drivers, software incompatibilities -- these are not the things you want to deal with when you fire up a gaming desktop. Your goal is to jump into the seat of a BMW 5 series or a Nissan GT-R and blast off over the sand dunes in the game Forza Horizon 3. You don’t want to deal with technical problems. Fortunately, in a test of several new Windows 10 games on an Acer Predator G1, none of the usual snafus happened, unless you count my ability to drive a GT-R on tight corners. The smaller form factor of the G1 -- which included a wheeled carrying case and Tom Clancy’s The Division on disc when it first came out this summer-- makes it easy to lug around. It’s about the size of an Xbox One. I only had to update the NVIDIA GTZ 1080 graphics card to the latest driver before testing out several new games. I used a Viewsonic 4K display, the included Acer mechanical keyboard and laser mouse, and my own set of Phiaton BT 220 NC wireless earbuds for pristine audio. The last time I tested 4K gaming, I had mixed results. Everything worked for the most part, but there was still the occasional stuttering problem, especially in Just Cause 3, and a slim selection of 4K games. That was back in May, and even this summer when the Predator G1 launched, there weren’t that many 4K options compared to the typical console games in HD. This month, I had my pick. I tried both Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 as my go-to games to test system performance. Smooth as butter. That was my main finding using the G1. In Horizon 3, the 4K resolution means you can see the thin lines of the rear window defogger on a Nissan GT-R and spot rain droplets on the windshield. On an Xbox One at 1080p, you can’t see the details as distinctly. I also noticed the shine from the car looked more pronounced in a way that convinces you that you’re really behind the wheel. In Gears of War 4, my first realization was that, even at 4K, the game was smoother than expected, especially in terms of the load times -- it was almost instant. Having all of this power -- an Intel Core i7-6700 processor, 32GB DDR4 of memory, plus a 512GB SSD and a 2TB 7200 RPM disk drive -- really helped. After a few levels, the blood-soaked behemoths never seemed to lag even when there was a massive cinematic death animation in full 4K glory. It's worth the investment in PC power. Next, I tested a few new games using the HTC Vive. Even the new Everest VR climbing game, which stresses the performance of many Windows desktops (even the higher-end models) never had any slowdowns, likely due to the GTX 1080 graphics card and the fast Intel processor. It looked and ran more convincingly. It's important to note here that, when I last tested 4K games and VR, there were slowdowns. Star Wars Battlefront in particular lagged a bit, like a super high-res photo on an iPad at times -- brilliant in color and clarity, not so much in speed. On the G1, a driving game like Forza in 4K is something to behold, a return to form for PC gaming. What’s really happening here? Obviously, the fast Intel CPU and the 32GB of RAM helps. The 1080 card from NVIDIA using the new Pascal architecture are dramatic improvements, up to 2x the performance from previous generation cards. More memory, more cores -- the 1080 card is the one you want for 4K gaming and virtual reality games. The Predator also offers some extra perks like Killer DoubleShot Pro, which dedicates the Ethernet port to gaming and allocates the Wi-Fi signal to other activities like web browsing or watching Twitch feeds. Really, it's the whole package working together to remove any performance glitches. I also liked having four USB ports on the back and one USB port on the front, which made it easier to connect an Xbox One controller. There’s also an SD Card reader for your camera files and an optical disc -- it’s for standard-def DVDs and games, not for Blu-Ray or 4K movies, which is a minor ding. I still tested a few YouTube streams in 4K and they looked smooth on my 200 Mbps connection. The G1 costs $2,300 which is a hair more than an Xbox One or a PlayStation 4 (ahem) but this is the top of the line in gaming. It’s a major plus that Microsoft now lets you play many newer Xbox games on Windows 10 for free (due to Xbox Play Anywhere) -- and it’s a simple download. The system worked perfectly for the HTC Vive as well, something you won’t be using on a lower-end laptop anytime soon. I’m impressed with the speed, the small size, and the design. It’s a Forza and GOW4 monster. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Information and communications technology (ICT) have hailed in the fourth industrial revolution setting a new benchmark for business. However, this era of the Internet of Things (IoT) is also challenging and “disrupting” conventional government service delivery models. As Dr. Setumo Mohapi, chief executive officer of the South African Information Technology Agency (SITA), points out, the facilitation of increased contribution to government activities by citizenry providing multi-modal public-service delivery. “New and more efficient state models that are built upon on these technologies are being established worldwide, and South Africa is following suit with ample examples that set the scene for our ‘e-government’ of the future,” says Dr. Mohapi. Many of these, such as eHomeAffairs, will be presented at this year’s Government Technology Conference (GovTech) by high-ranking representatives of departments and organs of state, and will be a major highlight of the event at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, Gauteng, from 30 October to 02 November. SITA is proud to be partnering with a number of prominent players in the ICT industry all with the common aim of enabling service delivery through ICT for citizen empowerment. This year’s sponsors include Vodacom, MTN, Microsoft, Gijima, Accenture, Business Connexion, Huawei, Pinnacle, Intel and CEOS. This year’s conference theme is ICT for Development, Access and Growth, and the role that technologies play in meeting these three critical goals enshrined in the National Development Plan will be unpacked during the four tracks of the conference. The first track, Access, will delve into how ICTs are helping government bridge the digital divide so that citizens can enjoy improved basic services, especially healthcare. A sound example is the role ICT is playing in ensuring equitable access to affordable medicines via initiatives, such as the Open Medicine Project. Government is already adopting new technologies and integrating them across its departments and agencies, to enhance these amenities, including education, and the Development track of the event will complement this discussion. This “disruption” for the better is evident by digital classrooms and mobile education training that is being facilitated by ICT technologies, and drivers of new thinking around tutelage, which will be brought to during this track. The third track, Growth, has on its agenda “smart” procurement practices in an “e-government” environment, with the SITA’s own “smart” buying initiatives to serve as one of many examples of the streamlining of state functions by effectively deploying ICTs. GovTech 2016 will conclude with the important Innovation track, which Dr. Mohapi says will emphasise the “T” in ICT. It points to the future of public-service delivery “where governments will eventually provide services without owning any hard assets”, motivating his views on efficient “decentralised” government organs that have transformed into “one-stop-shops” for all matters relating to service delivery. Existing business models, such as Uber, are already stimulating such thinking, and further motivated by models like Bitcoin and Blockchain that bring a strong element of trust to the IoT.

The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s datacenters can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: John Pike. John Pike Science Date of Publication: 10.14.16. 10.14.16 Time of Publication: 10:12 am. 10:12 am Elon Musk Is Treating Mars Like It’s a Moore’s Law Problem. It’s Not Elon Musk speaking at the 67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Sept. 27, 2016. Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg/Getty Images Hats off to Elon Musk. He gave us Paypal, Solar City, and Tesla Motors. If only some of his other, more ambitious ideas warranted the same praise. Take his latest plan, to shoot people off to Mars. Though details remain a bit confused, the key takeaway is tickets to Mars would sell for the modicum price of $200,000 apiece by 2024. Of course, Musk’s plan assumes someone is willing to front $10 billion or more to pay for all that gee-whiz rocketry and infrastructure he described at the International Astronautical Congress. (It also assumes $10 billion is enough, but more on that later.) When SpaceX debuted, Musk claimed his rockets would be 10 times cheaper, 10 times more reliable, and provide 10 times the flight rate of existing rockets—at least a 1,000-fold improvement that never came true. Musk’s ambitions seem to rely on that old Silicon Valley magical thinking, of an exponential growth curve predicting cheaper access to space. But he offers neither sufficient technology improvements nor evidence of demand to add up to a $200,000 trip to Mars. Musk is coming from a Moore’s Law world of computers and cars. Mars is not a Moore’s Law world. WIRED OPINION About John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, is an expert in space, defense, and intelligence policy, and is frequently called upon to testify in front of congress on these issues. Concerning technology, two types of problems exist: engineering problems that can be solved and physics problems that cannot be solved, only accepted and worked around. Solutions to engineering problems generally have a key performance parameter that embodies the essence of the solution. Take Moore’s Law. Around 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore observed that overall processing power for computers—the number of transistors on an equal-cost CPU—would double every two years or so. Moore’s Law was born, with a pretty amazing S-curve with persistent exponential growth that is responsible for the technological vastness of the future. A Moore’s-like growth curve requires an infinitesimal number of intermediate steps of improvement. Each year’s CPU, airplane, or automobile is slightly better than last year’s. As economies of scale lower costs, the market expands. In contrast to computers and cars, technologies with which Musk is familiar, rockets cannot be systematically improved. Specific impulse—the number of pounds of thrust produced per pound of propellant—is the key parameter capable of producing significant cost reductions in access to space. Technological solutions to improving specific impulse include building lighter rockets or finding better fuels. And rocket scientists optimized both of those when Eisenhower was president. That leaves the physics problem: Mass versus gravity. The only way to work around it is through economies of scale, driving down operational costs through an increased launch tempo. The problem with economy of scale is it relies on demand. SpaceX’s current launch tempo owes a lot to commercial satellite launches. Information is space’s biggest market. Naively, one might have hoped that the growth in satellite communications would have increased demand, and thus launch tempo, driving down prices. But the capacity increase was, ironically, eaten up by Moore’s Law—which allows satellites to transmit more information. Communications satellites have not significantly increased the demand for mass to orbit. Crewed spaceflight, in order to incur demand without cost, must go from the Wright brothers to the Concorde with no intermediate steps. But putting people into the equation makes the continuous improvements harder to meet. There are a handful of “islands of stability”—discrete objectives for piloted missions—100 km hop for tourists, low Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars. Similarly, there was an X-Prize for a 100-kilometer altitude flight, but none for 200 km. But the increments between those are huge, in terms of cost. No one remembers the first astronaut to go halfway to the Moon, because nobody cares what’s between the two. There was nothing between Neil Armstrong’s small step for a man and his giant leap for mankind. The very nature of space makes incremental steps moot. One of the fundamental problems with a grand visionary projects such as shooting people to Mars is they do nothing to solve the underlying problem of physics, laws of thermodynamics, and the most grand, visionary aspect of all: How to pay for them. Musk ignores the fact that NASA and others have outlined similar roadmaps to Mars for more than 50 years. He waves away the risks and technical limits of current technology to make it happen reliably, cheaply and safely, as if Moore’s law is easily applied. He shies away from discussing the infrastructure and work required to make it happen, letting others spell it out. Moore’s Law is a product of Silicon Valley, as is the tendency to misapply—with overreaching drama—it to various capital-P Problems. The September, 2013, issue of Time featured a cover story raising the tantalizing question “Can Google Solve Death?” And yet people are still turning up dead. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced a $3 billion effort “to rid world of major diseases by end of century.” Contrast that with the National Institutes of Health’s annual budget of more than $30 billion (about 2.5 trillion through 2099), with no such promise of ending ailments for all. Musk estimates that it will cost $10 billion to reach Mars. Every time NASA has pondered manned missions to the planet, the price has been several times the $150 billion (more or less) spent on the Apollo program to the moon and back. Not every problem has convenient engineering solutions. Vision without funding is hallucination. Mars is not a how problem, it is a why problem. I grow weary of pretty pictures of rockets. Musk has done the easy part of sketching the obvious destination. The hard part is why—why pay for it? And that has been on hold for decades. Musk’s rocket blueprints put us no closer today than we were half a century ago. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Elon Musk John Pike Mars Moore's Law opinion SpaceX Skip Social.

The mobile operator said it is joining the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) as the first network operator to participate. The group was formed in September by automakers Audi, BMW and Daimler and telecommunications equipment and IT companies Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. The association aims to speed up the commercial availability of 5G mobile connectivity so it can help automakers reachh their eventual goal of putting driverless cars on the road sometime in the next decade. Autonomous vehicles need to be able to send and receive large amounts of data almost instantly, which is impossible with the current 4G or LTE standard. Vodafone said it is already providing connectivity to around 10 million cars built by 19 different carmakers. The 5G association needs broad acceptance of the new communication standard across all industries, as the so-called Internet of things takes shape. Said Dino Flore, director general of the automotive group: “Vodafone’s industrial leadership and its perspective as a network operator is an enrichment of 5GAA and will contribute to the successful development of a networked mobility ecosystem.” The 5G association, which is open to additional members, expects, among other things, to run joint projects that can result in integrated solutions and large-scale pilots and trial deployments.

Maintaining cover: A guide to business insurance Let's have a meeting in the echo chamber Download Current Issue The consolidation in the distribution world continues with Exertis snapping up storage and server specialist Hammer for £38.3m. Last month Tech Data moved to acquire Avnet Technology Solutions and the world of the two-tier channel continues to shrink with this latest development. The Exertis deal has to get the thumbs up from the European Commission because of Hammer's European footprint in France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands. For its money Exertis gets a distributor with a strong pedigree in the storage and server market with a turnover of £155m last year and relationships with Dell, NetApp, Seagate, Intel and WD amongst others. Hammer also comes with a trading reseller base of around 1,000 and will continue as a standalone business after the deal closes by the end of the year. For Exertis this is not the first acquisition of a fellow distributor and in April it bought Siracom and last May it picked up Computers Unlimited for £24m. Niall Ennis, managing director of DCC Technology, said that Hammer had a strong reputation as a value added player and had developed a number of solutions aimed at vertical markets. "The acquisition has significant benefits for both companies increasing Exertis’ expertise and solutions in the storage market, complementary to our existing server and enterprise business, and providing Hammer customers and vendors with a platform for growth within a diverse and financially strong technology distribution company," he said. He added that it also gave Exertis the chance to expand its presence in those European countries where Hammer operated. In response, Hammer's managing director James Ward said that there would be opportunities for growth as a result of the acquisition. “By leveraging the complementary strengths of both companies we can only add value to what is an exciting proposition for all our stakeholders. We look forward to working with Exertis management teams and building on the success of both companies," he said. MicroScope+ Content Find more MicroScope+ content and other member only offers, here.

Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Intel, and Qualcomm created the 5G car club clique (AKA 5G Automotive Association) a couple of weeks ago, but someone forgot to put telcos on the invite list. That’s particularly funny, given it’ll be the telcos that actually deploy 5G – bit of an oversight that. So they took down the ‘no telcos allowed’ sign from the club house and opened the door for Vodafone to come skipping in. The telco says it’s bringing something extra to the gang, given it has already started testing cellular vehicle to everything connectivity – ‘C-V2X’. It also reckons it is the world leader **shudder** in IoT connectivity because it provides more connected car services for more models from more manufacturers in more countries than any other company. Bit of a brag, that. On top of this Vodafone also found the time to hold hands with Huawei over a lot of messing around with high and low frequency bands for dense urban city scenarios – claiming that to be in aid of 5G advancements. In keeping with any announcement of partnerships or trials and all that jazz, Huawei made a lot of claims about “firsts” and records and stuff like that. “The communication between vehicles, infrastructure and pedestrians using C-V2X will be fundamental to the creation of intelligent transport systems,” said Vodafone’s Group head of R&D and tech strategy, Luke Ibbetson. “The technology that the 5GAA develops can lead to major improvements in driving and road safety.” Huawei did, to be fair, claim some pretty hefty performance results from the field test, which used lots of technology cleverness like multi-user MIMO, Sparse Coding Multiple Access and Filtered-OFDM. Obviously you’d use MU-MIMO, SCMA and F-OFDM in a 5G trial, who wouldn’t? Anyway, Huawei says the trial managed a peak cell throughput of 18 Gbps under 200 MHz bandwidth in the sub-6 GHz band, while also achieving sub-millisecond latency.

Next, they're zeroing in on financial firms.

Hunt Transport was one of the last holdouts. The Arkansas-based trucking company hadn’t gotten any reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, officials told shareholder activist Brianna Murphy. And after her firm, Trillium Asset Management, filed a resolution asking Hunt to adopt policies explicitly protecting LGBT workers from bias, the company’s board recommended voting against the proposal. It was unnecessary, the company said. At Hunt’s annual meeting in April, however, an unprecedented 54 percent of investors voted in favor of Murphy’s resolution. The company revised its policy this summer. Although it manages only about $2 billion, Boston-based Trillium is one of a handful of activist investors that punch way above their weight when it comes to pushing diversity. These activists have prodded some of the largest public companies in the world to add women and minorities to their boards, to disclose data about the race and gender of their workforces, and to protect LGBTQ employees. Trillium's Brianna Murphy   Arjuna Capital's Natasha Lamb   This year, these David-size firms zeroed in on some tech Goliaths to get them to close the gap between what men and women make. While only a small number of the diversity proposals go to a vote and even fewer pass, they put companies on notice that diversity matters. “This is not only a social justice issue, it’s a business issue,” says Natasha Lamb, director for equity research and shareholder engagement at Boston-based Arjuna Capital. “More diverse teams lead to better financial outcomes.” She says she targeted tech because of the “enormous gaps” between its numbers of men and women. Women make up only 25  percent of the tech workforce and hold just 11 percent of management positions, she says. Lamb filed resolutions this year at nine tech companies, including Apple and Intel. Pax World Management, which is based in Portsmouth, N.H., and oversees about $4 billion, also filed an Apple proposal. At Apple’s shareholders meeting in February, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company was paying women 99.6 percent of what it pays men in the U.S., and he added that it would take steps to address the remaining gap in its total compensation. In August, Apple announced it had closed it for U.S. employees.  EBay announced today that its study found the gender pay gap effectively closed, with women employees in the U.S. earning 99.8 percent of the total compensation of men.   Go to {ESG <GO>} to explore a selected company's environmental, social, and governance data. In all, seven of the nine companies agreed to make their pay gap public and take steps to close it. “I’d say that this was a pretty successful campaign,” says Heidi Welsh, executive director of the Sustainable Investments Institute, a Washington nonprofit that tracks socially responsible investing.  Small firms such as Arjuna, Pax, and Trillium wield so much clout because a growing number of investors care deeply about diversity. Filing a resolution doesn’t require a lot of assets. A shareholder needs to own only $2,000 of a company’s stock for a year to do so. In most cases, activists withdraw a proposal if a company agrees to discuss the subject. That was the case with Apple. “We’d much prefer to have a dialog,” says Heather Smith, lead sustainability research analyst at Pax. According to data from ISS Governance, proposals asking companies to share and close their gender pay gap rose to 13 this year from just one in 2015 and none before that. Eight were withdrawn after companies agreed to talk with activists. While pay proposals are relatively new, actions seeking more diversity on boards remained roughly steady at 30, reflecting the continued underrepresentation of women and minorities. Such proposals have an impact even if they don’t get majority support, according to research by Carol Marquardt, a professor of accountancy at Baruch College in New York, and Christine Wiedman at the University of Waterloo. They tracked proposals at 136 companies from 1997 to 2011 and found that targeted companies increased their female board representation from 3  percent to 8 percent on average in the two years following the proposal.     As they begin working on their agenda for the 2017 proxy season this fall, these crusaders for diversity say pay equity remains a main focus as it gains national attention. Massachusetts and California have passed legislation aimed at closing the gender pay gap. And President Obama in January proposed a rule that would require all companies to include salary data along with their annual filings with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about the race and gender of their workforces. Arjuna’s Lamb says she’ll be looking at about eight companies in the coming year, including four of the big banks and two other financial services firms. Women in finance sometimes make up a majority of employees, but few hold top spots. Lamb has filed a resolution asking Starbucks to prepare a report on the company's policies and goals for reducing the gender pay gap and will also refile her proposals at Google and Facebook. Trillium’s Murphy is also looking at financial companies and plans to file resolutions at nine of them to get more disclosure of data on race, gender, and pay. She says she's filing resolutions at Aflac and Fifth Third Bancorp asking the companies to issue reports on workforce diversity. In addition, a Trillium proposal asks Visa to disclose its EEOC data and give details of its programs designed to boost diversity. Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim says the company has received the proposal and is evaluating it. Pax, too, is aiming to expand its pay equity campaign, and it’s petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to require all companies to disclose their pay data as material to performance. “Pay equity is no longer aspirational,” Lamb says. “It’s being implemented.”    Colby is a senior reporter at Bloomberg News in New York.   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Ceres’ Veena Ramani offers some practical advice. Research has shown that corporate directors at most major U.S. companies are not engaging on environmental and social issues in a meaningful way. Image:Pixabay By Veena Ramani Friday 14 October 2016 Share this story Despite growing evidence that environmental and social issues affect corporate bottom lines, Ceres research has shown that corporate directors at most major U.S. companies are not engaging on these issues in ways that are effective and meaningful. While many of these companies have sustainability programs, only a few companies consider these issues to be “board relevant.” I’m not suggesting that every sustainability challenge merits board attention, but when an issue materially could affect corporate performance or value, it belongs on the table. Sustainability officers at companies have a key role to play in driving the understanding of what should rise to the top. When an issue materially could affect corporate performance or value, it belongs on the table. So how can sustainability officers do a better job of elevating relevant issues to their boards? Here are a few ideas based on my 10 years of work on integrating sustainability into corporate strategies and bottom-line performance. 1. Engage corporate secretaries Corporate secretaries act as intermediaries to corporate boards and work closely with the CEO and the board chair to decide when and how issues get on the board agenda. A key role of the corporate secretary is advising the board on how they can discharge their responsibilities towards shareholders, which is why the CS and investor relations departments work closely together. Sustainability officers could engage the CS and IR by demonstrating that the company’s ownership is starting to pay attention. In fact, companies such as EMC and Intel have explicit board sustainability oversight systems in part because of engagements with shareholders. We’ve seen record-breaking growth in investors caring about sustainability (PDF) writ large, as well as investors specifically focused on the role of the board for sustainability (PDF). Large institutional investors such as CalPERS, CalSTRS and State Street Global Advisors (PDF) even have set public expectations on how corporate boards should be elevating their focus on climate change. 2. Build on existing priorities Kathrin Winkler, former chief sustainability officer at EMC, said, “It is important to do one’s homework on how governance is structured at the board level.” That means understanding the board committees, including their composition and charters. It also means knowing what issues the committees are already focused on. Given time constraints on a board’s agenda, rather than trying to add a new item for the board to consider, consider how sustainability can be folded into a discussion the board is already focused on such as evaluating the business model and supply chain risks or workforce retention. For instance, investors are looking to engage with the boards of energy companies on climate-related issues given the major impacts on their business models from carbon-reducing regulations and other carbon-reducing trends. “ When an issue materially could affect corporate performance or value, it belongs on the table. 3. Make the business case Ceres recently updated its Ceres Roadmap for Sustainability to call on boards to integrate sustainability into discussions on strategy, risk and revenue. In fact, as my recent View from the Top report points out, risk and revenue are the most direct routes for getting the board to focus on a sustainability issue. Dan Henkle, senior VP of global sustainability at Gap, suggests that in some cases, sustainability officers can use “points of pain” to frame sustainability from the risk perspective and engage the board and the CS on how these risks can be mitigated. This also could be a way to translate sometimes theoretical ideas into practical impact. Whether and how sustainability should be elevated as a material issue is a subject of intense investor focus. “They need to touch and feel what you are talking about,” he noted. For instance, many companies recognize the need to conserve water for environmental reasons. But where water scarcity is linked to cotton production, the impacts become much more tangible to an apparel company. Partnering with colleagues from the business side in this process also can be helpful. For instance, Nike’s Board Sustainability Committee is jointly staffed by the company’s chief sustainability officer and chief operating officer. Executives often appear before the committee to discuss how sustainability and business strategies are aligned and how this is reflected in the work of the teams that they lead. 4. Don’t overreach As noted earlier, it all comes down to materiality. In View from the Top, we underline that rather than engaging boards on sustainability writ large, it is most effective to get them to focus on specific environmental and social issues that materially could affect the company’s short and long term value. Most companies that publish sustainability reports have a process to determine material sustainability issues. But these efforts rarely inform board level discussions because they are not considered to meet pre-determined financial and regulatory thresholds. Whether and how sustainability should be elevated as a material issue is a subject of intense investor focus, with many investor groups, including Ceres, filing input to ratchet up the Securities and Exchange Commission’s attention to this issue. One way sustainability officers could bring these worlds together is to explore opportunities to emphasize the focus on “impact on corporate value” as a part of the materiality process. Given that sustainability officers typically lead the reporting function at companies, one tactical option is to advocate to have the board chair include a message in the sustainability reports. For instance, EMC systematically maps its material sustainability issues to the company’s major strategic themes, allowing for more integration into business priorities. The company also includes its board in materiality exercises, and revises key issues identified based on board feedback. Prudential Financial emphasizes the importance of getting material sustainability issues included in financial filings as a way to get sustainability issues in front of the board, which reviews such disclosures. Its annual financial proxy includes details (PDF) about the company’s environmental and sustainability efforts and features a board qualifications matrix that specifically pulls out board member expertise in sustainability and social responsibility. 5. Be more transparent Companies could do a much better job of telling the story of when their boards have been engaged in thoughtful oversight and decision making on key sustainability issues. Interest is growing in an initiative led by Harvard professor Robert Eccles calling for boards to release an annual Statement of Significant Audiences and Materiality, laying out whom the board considers to be a company’s primary stakeholders and corresponding matters that the company prioritizes. Given that sustainability officers typically lead the reporting function at companies, one tactical option is to advocate to have the board chair include a message in the sustainability reports. Many European companies routinely have their CEO and board chair sign off on the leadership message in these reports. The bottom line is that the sustainability officers have a big task in front of them in getting their boards on board — especially at U.S. companies — to focus on sustainability challenges with the urgency that these issues deserve. Companies such as EMC, Gap Inc., Nike and Prudential are showing strong leadership in elevating these issues and I hope more companies will learn from them.   Veena Ramani is a Senior Director in Ceres’ Corporate Programs. This post is republished from Corporate Citizenship.  Share this story Topics CSR Regions Global United States Tags governance reporting Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Most popular Carbon & Climate Collect Earth: Google and FAO launch new forest tool Collect Earth: Google and FAO launch new forest tool Policy & Finance Trumped: Ten immediate impacts on energy and climate Trumped: Ten immediate impacts on energy and climate Transport Why the bottom of the pyramid needs electric cars...now Why the bottom of the pyramid needs electric cars...now View all news Industry Spotlight Policy & Finance Eaton: Innovating to stay ahead of the game Eaton: Innovating to stay ahead of the game Energy The European way to green energy in Southeast Asia The European way to green energy in Southeast Asia CSR Why sustainability standards are important for India’s growth Why sustainability standards are important for India’s growth View all Feature Series Smart homes for the future Future-proofing Asian cities the smart way Future-proofing Asian cities the smart way Powering Asia Pacific's Solar Revolution Conergy: Sparking the Philippines' solar power revolution Conergy: Sparking the Philippines' solar power revolution International Green Building Conference 2016 7 ideas for greener, healthier living 7 ideas for greener, healthier living View all Featured Events nov 22 Philippines ADB Green Business Forum for Asia and the Pacific 2016 nov 22 Singapore Responsible Business Forum on Sustainable Development 2016 nov 24 China WasteMET Asia 2016 nov 27 Israel Eilat-Eilot Renewable and Clean Energy 2016 nov 29 Thailand Solar Finance & Investment | Solar & Off-Grid Renewables Southeast Asia feb 21 United Kingdom Energy from Waste feb 22 Australia Australian Waste to Energy Forum 2017 Add an Event View all Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletters The best Eco-Business stories, jobs and events delivered to your inbox – daily or weekly.

NAND flash drought hits Texan monster – sources DCC Technology today confirmed its subsidiary, Exertis, has gobbled specialist storage and lesser known server distie Hammer for an undisclosed sum, which should help ease recent top line pressures. Hammer trades with “almost” 1,000 reseller, system integrator and cloud service provider punters, selling infrastructure gear from vendors including Dell, Intel, NetApp, Seagate and Western Digital. London Stock Exchange listed DCC Technology said it will use the buy to cross-sell the expanded portfolio of servers, storage, networking, security and UC kit to existing customers and the ones it is hoping to inherit. Niall Ennis, DCC Technology managing director, claimed Hammer had carved a niche in enterprise services and “bespoke” stuff for vertical markets. He said the buy fitted well with its relatively small existing server and enterprise lines and gave Hammer’s traders “a platform for growth with a diverse and financially strong technology distribution company”. The deal also widens DCC’s reach into mainland Europe, beefing up sales in France and the Benelux countries and giving it a foothold in Germany and Sweden. Hammer employs 165 staff and in the year ended 31 January 2016 it turned over £154.7m compared to £133m in the prior financial year. It reported operating profit of £6.9m versus £5.29m. By contrast, DCC Tech’s fiscal ’16 ended 31 March was less good; revenue dropped four per cent to £2.44bn caused by slumping tab and smartphone sales. Operating profit was squeezed, falling nearly 29 per cent due to Samsung cutting out distribution to sell direct to large retailers. The Hammer buy is subject to approval from the European Commission but completion is expected for the end of 2016. No channel press release would be complete without the use of the word “synergy” - this is the IT industry, one that is renowned for corporate bull shit - and Hammer boss James Ward shoe-horned it into a sentence. “We see great synergy and opportunities for our customers, vendors and employees in joining Exertis. By leveraging the complementary strengths... blah, blah, blah,” said Ward. In truth, for both vendors, resellers, SIs and CSPs, distributor consolidation means one less source of supply, credit, and less bartering power. But it’ll mean DCC shareholders will get to see the right kind of top line movement, while the duplication of personnel in some departments no doubts means that costs can be trimmed to improve profits. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 1 Comment More from The Register US giant Ingram Micro snaps up little Brit Comms-care Regulator mulls Ingram's acquisition by China's HNA 2 Comments Ingram Micro $6bn sale to Chinese logistics biz delayed Bumps on road ahead?

We’ve also seen all sorts of foldable, flexible, even rollable keyboards that maximize mobility. But a flexible keyboard that hides a computer? That’s definitely a first. And that is exactly what a company by the name of Vensmile is attempting to sell. Simply called the K8, the product packages productivity in a more portable form. Too bad it doesn’t have package a display with it as well. The idea of a PC you can slip into your pocket isn’t exactly new. From the Intel Compute Stick to the InFocus Kangaroo, there have been numerous attempts to deliver a portable computer that isn’t “just” a smartpone. The problem with all of these is that, while portable, they do require you to have a display, keyboard, and mouse wherever you connect. If there’s only a TV or monitor, you’re out of luck. Unless you happen to purchase this Vensmile K8, which is a PC, keyboard, and mouse combo in one. Yes, mouse, because that shiny surface on top of the box is actually a 10-point touch pad. That bulky box itself is, as you might have guessed, is the PC. But don’t judge it by its diminutive size. It actually packs an Intel Atom x5-Z8300, 4GB of RAM, and 64 GB of storage expandable up to 32 GB more. There’s HDMI out capable of 4K resolutions and even VGA out but only for 1080p. There’s one USB 2.0 port and another USB 3.0 slot. Of course, there’s Wi-Fi and Bluetooth inside as well. As for the keyboard, it’s actually the least interesting here. It’s flexible, foldable, and waterproof, pretty much like all of its kin. Which is to say, it’s not going to sell with keyboard lovers. Speaking of selling, the Vensmile K8 is currently on pre-order from Geekbuying, with shipping set later this month. At only $200, it might be a tempting backup computer to have. How it holds up in practice, however, is yet to be seen.

X DCC spends €42.5m on digital storage specialist Hammer UK-based server distribution business seen as complementing DCC’s Exertis unit Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:43 Updated: Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:49 Joe Brennan DCC chief executive Tommy Breen said Hammer’s expertise would better enable the company to take advantage of positive industry trends. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons         DCC’s technology division has agreed to acquire UK-based Hammer, a specialist distributor of server and storage solutions, in a deal initially valued at £38.3 million (€42.5 million). Hammer, which employs 165 people, is a distributor for a number of suppliers, including Dell, Intel, and NetApp, to almost 1,000 resellers, cloud service providers and system integrators in the UK and much of western Europe. DCC said the business is complementary to its own unit Exertis’s existing server and storage business. Tommy Breen: the puppetmaster pulling the strings at DCC DCC chief Tommy Breen’s pay package falls slightly to €4.5m Weak sterling helps DCC as first-quarter profit soars “Hammer’s expertise will better enable us to take advantage of positive industry trends, including growth in cloud data centres and demand for big data analytics,” said DCC chief executive Tommy Breen. In the year to the end of January, Hammer earned an operating profit of £6.3 million on revenue of £155 million. DCC has agreed to pay the purchase price entirely in cash and is structured as an initial payment at completion, followed by earn-out payments over three years based on Hammer’s future trading results.       Topics: Tommy Breen DCC Dell Computer Exertis Hammer Intel Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

The acquisition, should it be approved by the European Commission, will see the Basingstoke distributor acquire all of Hammer, who is based in the same area. Hammer specialises in distributing server and storage services, offering products from Dell and Intel, amongst many others, It will add more than £155 million to Exertis’ existing turnover of £3 billion. Exertis staff numbers will be boosted from 1,150 to 1,315, whilst reseller numbers will also increase by 1,000. The deal is expected for completion by the end of this year. Exertis claims the purchase will strengthen its current enterprise portfolio and enhance its range of products in the server and storage market. It would be Exertis’ second major acquisition in over a year. The firm had acquired IT specialist Computers Unlimited in May last year for £24 million, adding £140 million to its annual turnover. DCC Technology managing director Niall Ennis said: “Hammer has enjoyed considerable success in providing value-added services and bespoke solutions in a number of vertical markets for their customers and has a well-earned reputation as a storage specialist. “The acquisition has significant benefits for both companies increasing Exertis’ expertise and solutions in the storage market, complementary to our existing server and enterprise business, and providing Hammer customers and vendors with a platform for growth within a diverse and financially strong technology distribution company. In addition, this deepens Exertis’ presence across several European countries.”     TAGS Dell Exertis Hammer Consolidated Holdings Intel SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleMore than 77 per cent of UK students without insured smartphone, claims giffgaff Next articleSamsung forecasts £4.4bn hit to profits from Note7 saga Alex Yau http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Bruno Duarte to depart as EE head of operations and strategy EE becomes first TV platform to partner with Twitter Vodafone Group H1 revenue declines 3.9pc to £23 billion NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Business Development Manager: Garry Wybourn – 0203 122 0872 / 07747 632 553 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

Asus Transformer Mini Goes on Sales as an Affordable Microsoft Surface Clone GO The 2-in-1 can be yours for just $399 with 128 GB of storage Oct 14, 2016 09:45 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  There are plenty of Microsoft Surface clones out there, but the majority of them are manufactured by Chinese companies that are looking to benefit from the success of the original model with their own cheap knockoffs. In the case of Asus, however, the Transformer Mini is quite a premium device, and although it comes with a design that clearly reminds of Microsoft’s Surface tablet, it’s definitely worth a look at given the combination of powerful hardware and affordable price. The Transformer Mini is now on sale at Amazon for only $399 - this is the US pricing, and those who’ll want to buy it in other markets might have to pay more or less, depending on taxes. As far as the hardware is concerned, the Transformer Mini comes with an Intel Cherry Trail Quad-Core processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics and 4 GB of RAM. The device features 128 GB of storage space, but thanks to microSD card support, you can expand it with an additional of 200 GB. Super lightweight The 10.1-inch screen has a resolution of 1280x800 pixels, but also very important is that Asus used a design available on the Surface and the device integrates a kickstand that makes it possible to be used just like a laptop when a keyboard is attached. Furthermore, at 530 grams it’s quite light thanks to the magnesium-aluminum alloy body, and this brings it in line with the Surface, whose weight does not exceed 600 grams, no matter the model. On the other hand, the Transformer Mini also comes with a fingerprint reader for Windows Hello, but also with a USB Type-C port and microHDMI for easy connection to an external screen. Without a doubt, this is one very interesting machine, so if you’re looking for a Surface clone, but you’re not willing to go for a Chinese clone, this is at least worth a chance.

China’s largest e-commerce company is working on expanding the range of services it offers over the internet and will work with Advanced Micro Devices to use the chipmaker’s Radeon Pro graphics, the companies said Friday in a statement. For AMD, which is the second-largest maker of graphics chips used in high-end computers behind Nvidia Corp., the deal is the chance to kick start a return to the lucrative data center market dominated by Intel Corp. Graphics chips are playing an increasing role in data centers where their ability to process information in parallel makes them useful in certain work loads such as image recognition. Nvidia has pioneered this more general use of the chips, which had mainly been used by computer gamers to get a more realistic experience from their hardware. AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, has begun its fight back from market share losses to Nvidia in graphics and Intel in general purpose processors with new products that have closed the gap in performance. AMD’s stock has more than doubled this year, making it the best performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, spurred by improving sales and progress in its attempt to return to profitability.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 14 October 2016 | MYT 3:47 PM Amazon and VMware form alliance in the cloud Mighty match: The powerful cloud computing arm of online retail giant Amazon will be able to handle VMware software and tools. — Reuters Cloud computing rivals VMware and Amazon Web Services announced an alliance that will let them play off each other's strengths. The powerful cloud computing arm of online retail giant Amazon will be able to handle VMware software and tools popular with businesses, according to the companies. The move was described as being tailored to integrate the world's leading private cloud (VMware) with the world's leading public cloud (AWS). "VMware Cloud on AWS offers our customers the best of both worlds," said VMware chief executive Pat Gelsinger. "This new service will make it easier for customers to preserve their investment in existing applications and processes while taking advantage of the global footprint, advanced capabilities, and scale of the AWS public cloud." The new service was said to represent a significant investment in engineering, operations, support and sales resources from Amazon and VMware. "Our customers continue to ask us to make it easier for them to run their existing data center investments alongside AWS," said Amazon Web Services chief executive Andy Jassy. "With VMware Cloud on AWS, for the first time, it will be easy for customers to operate a consistent and seamless hybrid IT environment using their existing VMware tools on AWS." AWS lets businesses such as Netflix access computing power for websites or apps on networks typically open to the public. Such "public cloud" services are offered by Amazon, Google and Microsoft. VMware has found success with "private cloud" computing that businesses can do on-premise in their own systems. Silicon Valley-based VMware is a subsidiary of EMC Corporation, which was bought by US computer maker Dell in late 2015. —  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Fine-tune your songs Cyclist has grand tales to tell after going through 22 countries MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Warning!

A recent entrant to the FTSE 100, DCC distributes products in the oil, electronics and healthcare sectors and also operates in waste management. The Dublin-based company said Hammer's business was complementary to its existing server and storage business, and that the deal – which is subject to competition clearance from the European Commission – should be competed by the end of December. Hammer distributes server and storage products for a broad range of suppliers including Dell, Intel, NetApp, Seagate and Western Digital, and sells to resellers, cloud service providers and system integrators from sales offices in the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Holland and Belgium. Polite Server Spreads Holiday Cheer Play! 00:59 DCC has agreed to acquire 100pc of the issued share capital of Hammer based on an initial enterprise value of £38.3m, and will pay in cash. An initial payment, made on the deal's completion, will be followed by further payment based on Hammer's future trading results. In its financial year ended 31 January 2016, Hammer, which employs 165 people, made an operating profit of £6.3m on revenue of £155m. DCC can also boast good recent results, partly off the back of previous acquisitions. The company's operating profit rose to £300.5m for the year ending March 31, from £221.7m last time round.  Last year DCC bought French gas company Butagaz from Shell for €464m, and snapped up Esso’s unmanned petrol station business in France for €106m. Tommy Breen, DCC's chief executive, said: "The acquisition of Hammer will significantly strengthen the product and service capability offered by Exertis to its reseller customers. "In addition, Hammer's expertise will better enable us to take advantage of positive industry trends, including growth in cloud datacentres and demand for big data analytics." Jefferies reiterated their advice to invest in DCC.  Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: Utilities and support services FTSE 100 Show more Business latest 16 Nov 2016, 6:25am Questor: Inject Novo Nordisk into your portfolio for a 4pc yield and low valuation Premium 16 Nov 2016, 12:01am Hefty price tags: The most expensive places in the world to be a retailer 15 Nov 2016, 10:45pm Snapchat prepares for $25bn+ flotation  15 Nov 2016, 9:29pm Global dollar shock threatens fresh financial storm, warns watchdog Premium 15 Nov 2016, 9:27pm Comment: Tesco’s 'Drastic' Dave Lewis may be urged to show his daring side Ben Marlow Premium 15 Nov 2016, 8:58pm Comment: It's painful to admit, but I agree with Trump about central banks  Ben Wright Premium 15 Nov 2016, 7:55pm Google to create 3,000 more UK jobs in major boost for London technology scene 15 Nov 2016, 6:51pm High street bargains hold down inflation as Mark Carney warns higher prices are 'going to come' 15 Nov 2016, 6:42pm Exxon battles to get reduction in record $74bn fine over oil royalties 15 Nov 2016, 6:30pm Comment: Trump's 'Keynesian stimulus' threatens to reignite dormant eurozone crisis Jeremy Warner Premium 15 Nov 2016, 5:24pm Italian growth overtakes Germany as the eurozone’s core slows down  01:46 15 Nov 2016, 5:24pm Pound edges back above $1.24 as Mark Carney calls attacks on central bankers a 'massive blame-deflection exercise' 15 Nov 2016, 5:03pm John Lewis sends perfect Christmas gift to long-suffering Twitter user John Lewis 15 Nov 2016, 4:51pm B&M bullish on store roll-outs despite sterling slump 15 Nov 2016, 4:45pm Wembley developer secures £800m loan from North American funds 15 Nov 2016, 4:09pm Revealed: where to move in the UK if you want to make your salary stretch further  15 Nov 2016, 3:15pm FirstGroup riding high on the dollar as its US businesses drive growth 01:15 15 Nov 2016, 3:01pm What date is Black Friday 2016?

X DCC spends €42.5m on digital storage specialist Hammer UK-based server distribution business seen as complementing DCC’s Exertis unit Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:43 Updated: Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:49 Joe Brennan DCC chief executive Tommy Breen said Hammer’s expertise would better enable the company to take advantage of positive industry trends. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons         DCC’s technology division has agreed to acquire UK-based Hammer, a specialist distributor of server and storage solutions, in a deal initially valued at £38.3 million (€42.5 million). Hammer, which employs 165 people, is a distributor for a number of suppliers, including Dell, Intel, and NetApp, to almost 1,000 resellers, cloud service providers and system integrators in the UK and much of western Europe. DCC said the business is complementary to its own unit Exertis’s existing server and storage business. Tommy Breen: the puppetmaster pulling the strings at DCC DCC chief Tommy Breen’s pay package falls slightly to €4.5m Weak sterling helps DCC as first-quarter profit soars “Hammer’s expertise will better enable us to take advantage of positive industry trends, including growth in cloud data centres and demand for big data analytics,” said DCC chief executive Tommy Breen. In the year to the end of January, Hammer earned an operating profit of £6.3 million on revenue of £155 million. DCC has agreed to pay the purchase price entirely in cash and is structured as an initial payment at completion, followed by earn-out payments over three years based on Hammer’s future trading results.       Topics: Tommy Breen DCC Dell Computer Exertis Hammer Intel Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

HP Inc. is powering up and slimming down its high-end PC lineup. Company officials this week unveiled the latest iterations of the company's premium consumer systems, putting the new 7th Generation Core "Kaby Lake" processors from Intel into the second generation of its Spectre x360 convertible notebook (pictured) and putting more battery life and 4K resolution into some of the systems in its Envy lineup. The new systems—most of which are scheduled to be available this month—come in time for the important holiday buying season. They were announced the same week that analysts from IDC and Gartner noted that HP was closing in on global PC market leader Lenovo. The new systems were designed to get more performance and be even easier to take on the move than their predecessors, according to Kevin Frost, vice president and general manager of consumer personal systems at HP. "Premium customers have high expectations around device performance and quality for consuming media and productivity, whether at home, work or on the go," Frost said in a statement, adding that HP redesigned its PC lineup "to deliver big power in thin and light designs to be even more portable and revolutionize our all-in-one to bring amazing sound into the home." The latest Spectre x360 is powered by Intel's latest 14-nanometer Core i5 or i7 processors, which were launched in August. The new chips—which feature performance and power efficiency gains over their Skylake predecessors—helped HP's newest system gain 25 percent better battery life, which means up to 15 hours. In addition, HP was able to fit a larger, 57.8-watt battery into a design that is 13 percent thinner and 11 percent lighter than the first-generation Spectre x360. In addition, the system features a 13.3-inch display that has almost no borders, offers four speakers rather than two and comes with Thunderbolt 3 support and a USB-Type A 3.0 port. There is a dual-fan design for better thermals and the option of up to 1TB PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) storage capability. With HP's Fast Charge feature, users can recharge the battery to 90 percent in 90 minutes. With the latest 13.3-inch Envy laptop, users can get 14 hours of battery life—four more than the previous model. It's actually slightly larger than the previous model—coming in at 14mm and 3.15 pounds—but it also is more powerful, with a larger battery and the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 chips. There are two USB 3.0 ports and a USB Type-C port, the same SSD storage capabilities as the new Spectre x360, up to 16GB of RAM and the Fast Charge feature. With the Envy All-in-One (AIO) 27, HP engineers moved the systems compute capabilities into the base, which enabled them to reduce the 27-inch display's thickness by 44 percent, to 15mm, HP officials said. It comes with theater-like sound qualities, a 3.6 million-pixel screen and a low-blue light mode for more eye comfort and a better night's sleep. The AIO also includes an optional GTX 950M discrete graphics card from Nvidia with 4GB GDDR5 video, hybrid storage options up to a 256GB SSD and 2TB hard-disk drive (HDD) and HDMI-out and in ports. The Envy 27 Display include a 4K IPS display with a micro-edge bezel design that customers can use to create dual-display setups, support for Advanced Micro Devices' FreeSync for better game playing and such connectivity capabilities as Display Port, HDMI and USB-C. The Spectre x360, Envy laptop and AIO are slated to be available this month, with prices starting at $1,049.99, $849.99 and $1,299.99, respectively. The Envy 27 Display is scheduled for availability Dec. 4 starting at $499.99. HP, which in 2013 was dislodged as the world's top PC vendor by Lenovo, is pushing its way back to the top of contracting market, according to Gartner and IDC analysts. According to Gartner, Lenovo had 20.9 percent of the market, while HP had 20.4 percent. IDC analysts said it was even tighter, with Lenovo having 21.3 percent of the market and HP 21.2. Lenovo was hindered by slow growth in China, which is where the company has its largest share, and saw the number of its PC shipments decline year over year, while both HP and Dell grew shipments.           LATEST PC HARDWARE ARTICLES   Factors You Need to Consider When Replacing Aging Laptops New Microsoft Surface Books, Surface Dial Go on Sale Microsoft Nixes Xbox Streaming Stick AMD Targets Gaming, VR Content Creators With New Radeon Graphics Cards Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The Largest DDoS Attack Yet Seen OVH isn't just an internet service provider, they provide shared cloud hosting, domain registration, and VOIP telephone services. This was a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack, which attempts to flood a network resource with online traffic, causing it to become unavailable to the internet. One single computer cannot accomplish this task by itself. Instead, the hackers used over 100,000 IoT devices to hack OVH. The network of devices, a large group of devices including cameras and digital video recorders (DVRs), was controlled through a multivector DDoS attack. According to OVH, however, other devices were also involved—even Raspberry Pis.  One cause of this vulnerability was the settings on the devices used in the attack—i.e., these devices were improperly configured, allowing for them to be easily taken over. On September 22nd, OVH founder and CTO Octave Klaba tweeted a picture which illustrates just how large attacks were. At one point, the simultaneous attacks accounted for almost 1 Tbps. Other numerous attacks were still well over 100 Gbps, causing the company's servers to be tested to their utmost ability.   Tweet from Octave Klaba / Oles (@olesovhcom) September 22, 2016   Klaba later tweeted that "This botnet with 145607 cameras/dvr (1-30Mbps per IP) is able to send >1.5Tbps DDoS. Type: tcp/ack, tcp/ack+psh, tcp/syn". While this was ongoing, OVH was facing more and more devices attacking them daily. Not long before the attack on OVH, Brian Krebs' popular security news and investigation blog, KrebsOnSecurity, was targeted attacked through DDoS. This attack supposedly stemmed from taking part in exposing an Israeli firm, vDOS global, for its DDoS attack service. The attacks were so severe that Krebs' cloud-hosting service actually kicked KrebsOnSecurity off their servers, effectively killing the site temporarily. As of now, the site is back up and Krebs has since released several blog posts regarding the attack and how IoT hacks work in general.   How Can the IoT Be Hacked? There are millions of IoT devices in use today, bringing households closer to becoming fully automated. IoT devices are physical objects that hold an IP address for the purpose of connecting to the internet and allowing communication between themselves and other physical IoT devices and systems. There are various techniques to go about attacking these devices but in the case of OVH, hackers attacked a closed circuit television (CCTV system) to obtain a DDoS bot to their network and crash the OVH servers. As mentioned above, something as simple as having faulty settings on their devices or not changing default passwords allows for hackers to have an easy time forming an attack. Web security company, Cloudflare, also suffered an attack recently. This week, they posted an in-depth exploration of the attacks targeted at their servers.   A graph of the attacks sustained by Cloudflare. Image courtesy of Cloudflare.   Cloudflare was contending with what are known as Layer 7 (L7) attacks which use HTTP GET and exhaust servers by pretending to be legitimate connections instigated by actual people. OVH, by comparison, was apparently dealing with Layer 3 (L3) attacks, a more common form of attack that aims to overwhelm server resources. However, the attacks are similar in that Cloudflare, like OVH, is confident that they can trace the attack to IoT devices and CCTV cameras.   Preventing Future IoT-Fueled Attacks So how can further attacks be prevented? It's not as straightforward of an answer as one would think. Many—if not all—companies are aware of the serious security issues presented by the IoT, but it isn't always easy to respond to attacks as soon as they happen. Attacks aren't generally the same and for each industry and vary greatly. This is what makes it rather hard for companies to address risks before they happen—they do not always see potential vulnerabilities.  Intel's CTO Steve Grobman suggested that IoT devices should only be given the minimum amount of access to networks that they need for their specified function. As it is, many products are given more connectivity than they strictly need. Below is a map that illustrates the density of open security cameras across the United States.   Map courtesy of CARTO Data Analysis Team While OVH suffered from a huge attack, they have an extremely good anti-DDoS system in place. This system has a 3 Tbps surplus network that allows them to "soak up" data across their peer points that they have across the US. While at its peak, the attack reached around 1 Tbps of botnets DDoSing their system, this only accounted for about a third of OVH's complete network. In short, this extraordinary attack would have needed a much larger fleet of bots to completely take down OVH's system.

Login Search Reassuring Start to Q3 Earnings Season October 14, 2016, 04:43:00 PM EDT By Sheraz Mian, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo The big banks have given us a reassuring start to the Q3 reporting cycle. If this trend continues next week when a broad and representative cross section of corporate America is on deck to come out with quarterly results, then we will have a tangible reason to get optimistic about the overall earnings picture.   J.P. Morgan ( JPM ) stayed true to its well-earned reputation for operational excellence, with solid gains in both consumer banking as well as in its capital markets platform. In consumer banking, the core loan portfolio was up a robust +15% from the same period last year on essentially flat net-interest margin. On the investment banking side, J.P. Morgan came out with momentum in both capital markets as well as on the advisory side. On the markets side, J.P. Morgan's trading volumes benefited from the post-Brexit surge, which management indicated has continued into Q4 as well. Overall markets revenue was up more than +20%, largely reflecting momentum in fixed income, currencies and commodities. We saw this positive capital markets trend in the Citigroup ( C ) report as well, which has favorable read-throughs for the Goldman Sachs ( GS ) report on Tuesday and Bank of America ( BAC ) report on Monday. The Wells Fargo ( WFC ) report was solid as well, but the issue with them is more about political scrutiny, negative headlines and potential litigation and not earnings, at least no at this stage. It will be interesting if this positive start from the major banks will continue with the other banks who are reporting this week. Bank earnings continue to be shackled by low interest rates, which have been weighing on the group's margins. The interest rates question is of course very complicated, as it not only reflects the market's evolving Fed view, but also the widespread incidence of negative yields in many other developed markets. Current consensus expectations for the group for the coming quarters and beyond reflect a notable improvement in this situation, particularly with respect to margins, as the chart below of annual Finance sector margins, shows. This week's reporting docket isn't just about banks and the broader Finance sector, we have more than 240 companies reporting results this week, including 80 S&P 500 members from a cross section of all major sectors. We will have a pretty good sense of how the Q3 earnings season is unfolding by the end of this week.   Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard ( as of 10/14/2016 ) Including the bank earnings reports, we now have Q3 results from 34 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 34 S&P 500 members are up +1.3% from the same period last year on +2.9% higher revenues, with 79.4% beating EPS estimates and 64.7% coming ahead of revenue estimates. The table below shows the scorecard of these 34 index members. This is better performance than we have seen from the same group of 34 index members in other recent periods, as the comparison charts below show. The picture emerging from the above comparison chart would be in-line with our modestly favorable commentary on the Q2 earnings season when we were detecting an ever-so-slight improvement in the growth picture. Earnings growth was in negative territory in Q2 - the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the index - but the pace of declines was nevertheless an improvement over what we had seen in the preceding two quarters. This gave rise to the narrative that the worst was likely behind us now on the growth front and that the picture will steadily be improving going forward. For the Finance sector, we have Q3 results from only 5 sector members. But these 5 combined account for more than a fifth of the sector's total market cap in the index. Total earnings for these 5 sector companies (includes J.P. Morgan, Citigroup & Wells Fargo) are up +1.3% from the same period last year on +2.9% higher revenues, with all of them beating EPS and revenue expectations (100% beat %). This is better performance than we have seen from these banks in a while, as the below comparison charts show. Q3 Expectations As a Whole The strong results from the major banks has helped improve the overall Q3 growth expectations, with total Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index now expected to be down -2.2% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues. This would compare to 2016 Q2 earnings growth of -2.8% on +0.2% higher revenues. The table below shows the summary picture for Q3 earnings, revenues and margins contrasted with the corresponding results from the previous quarter. As you can see, Energy still remains the biggest drag on the aggregate growth picture, with Autos and Transportation as the other major growth laggards. Tough comparisons at Ford ( F ) and the air carriers, particularly United ( UAL ) and American ( AAL ), explain the growth issues in those two sectors. For the two biggest sectors, Technology earnings are expected to be down -1.7% on -1.1% lower revenues while Finance earnings are expected to be up +8.5% on +1.4% higher revenues. The Tech decline is solely a function of Apple ( AAPL ), which is expected to see earnings decline -20.6% from the same period last year on -9.6% lower revenues. Excluding the Apple drag, the Tech sector's earnings would be up +3.0%. Expectations Beyond Q3 The chart below shows current bottom-up consensus earnings expectations for the index in 2016 Q3 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual results in the preceding four quarters. Please note that the columns represent bottom-up earnings totals for each quarter in billions of dollars while the line represents the quarterly growth rates. As you can see, positive growth is expected to resume from Q4 (+5.2%), with the growth pace expected to ramp up meaningfully in the following quarters. The Energy sector drag is expected to end in 2016 Q4 and beyond, as the chart below of the sector's earnings shows. The improved Energy sector outlook makes sense, given shifting comparisons and the recent momentum in oil prices . But we will have to wait to find out if estimates for the other sectors will hold up as companies report Q3 results and provide guidance for Q4 and beyond. It will be interesting to see if the decelerated pace of negative revisions that we saw the last earnings season will get repeated this time as well.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 15, 2016 at 11:42AM "Big brand" companies are appealing long-term investments because they have well-established brands, robust cash flow, and wide competitive moats. That's why these stocks usually rebound from nasty bear markets, while lesser-known brands with weaker cash flows wither. I personally own several big brand stocks, and today I'll discuss two of my favorite long-term plays: Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Walt Disney Disney is best known for its theme parks and cartoons, but its sprawling media empire also includes Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, ABC, ESPN, and the Disney Channels. Disney's theme park and movie businesses are posting robust growth, but cord-cutting has hurt is cable subscriber numbers in recent years. Those fears caused Disney to slump 14% over the past 12 months, but it remains up about 190% over the past five years. Image source: Pixabay. Disney is trying to allay fears about its media business, which generated almost half its operating income in the first nine months of 2016, with new investments and partnerships. It recently acquired a 33% stake in Major League Baseball's BAMTech streaming unit to serve as the foundation for a new stand-alone over-the-top platform for ESPN, and announced that AT&T will bundle its main cable channels into its DIRECTV Now packages. Many streaming-only "skinny bundles," which include a smaller set of channels at lower prices, also include Disney's cable channels. Disney still has plenty of ways to diversify away from cable TV. Its future growth in theme parks, supported by the recent opening of Shanghai Disney Resort and the upcoming opening of Star Wars Land at its domestic theme parks, could offset softness in its media business. Its film business, which is firing on all cylinders with "cinematic universes" for its Marvel and Star Wars characters, is built to provide reliable box office returns for years. Analysts expect the House of Mouse's revenue to grow 7% this year and 4% next year, while earnings are expected to improve 12% this year and 5% next year. Those forecasts reflect concerns about Disney's cable business, but the stock remains fairly cheap at 16 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 19 for diversified entertainment companies. AT&T Telecom giant AT&T has hiked its payout annually for over three decades. It currently pays a forward yield of 4.9%, and spent 67% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months. In previous years, AT&T was a slow-growth stock with a price which barely budged. Yet the stock rallied almost 20% over the past 12 months due to two main factors. First, low interest rates caused many investors to flock to high-yielding dividend stocks like AT&T. Second, AT&T's $49 billion acquisition of DIRECTV turned it into the biggest pay TV provider in America and boosted its free cash flow 60% to $15.9 billion last year. AT&T's FCF has continued to grow this year, with 17% year-over-year growth in the first quarter and 8% growth in the second. Image source: AT&T. AT&T also sold a large portion of its slower-growth wireline services to Frontier Communications to invest more heavily in its higher-growth wireless business. To simultaneously grow DIRECTV and its wireless business, AT&T started offering wireless users unlimited data plans if they signed up for DIRECTV. It also launched streaming DIRECTV video bundles for its mobile users. AT&T is also expanding beyond mobile devices by selling wireless plans for smart homes, drones, and connected cars. It partnered with Intel to develop autonomous 4G drones, and is working with Ford to connect "at least" 10 million cars within the next five years. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to rise 12% this year and 2% next year. Earnings are expected to grow 5% this year and 6% next year. Its top-line slowdown could be caused by the saturation of the wireless market amid rising competition from smaller rivals like T-Mobile, which recently launched unlimited data, talk, and text plans for all its customers. Nonetheless, AT&T remains a solid dividend stock with a P/E of 17 -- much lower than the industry average of 25 for domestic telcos. Are these big-brand stocks right for you? I originally bought Disney and AT&T at lower prices, but I wouldn't hesitate to add more shares of both companies today. Disney's year-long swoon has cooled off its multiples to more attractive levels, and AT&T's 4.9% yield remains one of the safest income investments in the market today.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. “The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great,” said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report.” The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor’s 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow’s gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain’s High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya’s sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. “It was a good kickoff to earnings season” for banks, said Baele. “It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading.” Rising bond yields attracted investors’ attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday’s losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department’s report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl’s lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy’s fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn’t interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since Oct. 5 on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 percent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 percent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 percent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France’s CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany’s DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand’s SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand’s king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch’s health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, cents, stocks, banks, companies, yields, Other stories from today: After the scandal, Wells Fargo’s damage becomes apparent Yellen: Slow recovery from Recession confounds economists’ expectations Young black doctor says Delta attendant refused her help     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   In six months, the economy will be ...

The hybrid device has been the subject of many reports, with its rumored specs and release date. When Will the Device Be Launched? The excitement over the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has been at an all-time high due to rumors suggesting that it may be released sooner than expected. As the tech giant is set to hold an event later this month, there have been reports saying that the hybrid tablet will be unveiled there as well, along with other next generation devices. If these were true, then fans of the device may finally get to see the Surface Pro 5 as early as the 26th of October. This is a highly optimistic prediction though, as some experts believe that the Surface Pro 5 may not be launched until the middle of 2017. This is due to the fact that some hardware acquisitions to be integrated in the tablet will officially be released by next year. There are also reports saying that the Microsoft event later this month will be showcasing the company's latest operating system updates, and not their upcoming hardware. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Possible Price Tag One of the reports even put the release date of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to as early as spring in 2017. It has also indicated that the fifth iteration of the beloved hybrid tablet may tout a similar or even a slightly higher price tag in comparison to its predecessor. If the tech company actually pulls off this pricing bracket, then the Surface Pro 5 would definitely be a steal given its advanced specs and features. The report has predicted that the Surface Pro 5 will start at $899. Similarly, this is the current price tag of the lowest model of the Surface Pro 4. The configuration comes with an Intel Core m3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage. If compared with the rumored specs of the Surface Pro 5, then the upcoming device will definitely be leaps ahead of its predecessor. Rumored Specs The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to be equipped with the next generation Intel Kaby Lake processor. This is the main reason behind the delay reports as the chipsets are bound to be released next year. This will then be paired with Microsoft's very own Windows 10 Redstone operating system. The software and hardware optimization will ensure a smooth overall performance for the users. There would be at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage for the base model. A USB Type-C port would also be available, along with a headphone jack. Per usual, it will natively support the Surface Pen and a peripheral keyboard.

(AP) — Ronald Reagan won a historic landslide victory in the 1984 election, taking 49 of 50 states. But he failed to win the vote of a young Republican businessman in New Mexico whose willingness to go against the political grain has made him this presidential campaign's X-factor. Outraged at the GOP president's budget deficits, Gary Johnson for the first time voted for the Libertarian candidate. Ten years later, Johnson became New Mexico's governor, and was known for vetoing bill after bill before he became a national curiosity for advocating legalized marijuana. Now, at age 63, he's the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee, a marijuana-promoting fitness aficionado who summited Mount Everest and now climbs a political mountain with tough odds of reaching the top. Though Johnson has grabbed more attention for his stance on drugs and difficulty answering foreign-policy questions, fiscal conservatism remains his animating force. "I always pushed the envelope," said Johnson, who's proposed deep cuts to military and other government spending as well as elimination of the federal departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Education, and Housing and Urban Development. "I wasn't a wallflower when I was governor and I do think government spends too much money in areas that don't make a big difference in people's lives." Before he came out for legalizing marijuana shortly after his re-election as New Mexico governor in 1998, Johnson was nicknamed "Governor Veto." He piled up a record 700-plus vetoes during his two terms in Santa Fe. Admirers liked his dedication to limiting the size of government. Detractors considered him narrow-minded and incurious about the outside world. "He just does not believe government should be involved in dealing with social problems," said state Sen. Jerry Pino y Ortiz, who ran two social service agencies during Johnson's administration and feels the former governor let down his achingly poor state. "It's like the dad who's proud that his kid gets by on the smallest allowance at school, but the kid's shoes have holes in them." Rod Adair is a Republican political strategist and former state lawmaker who agrees with Johnson's small-government philosophy. The problem, Adair said, is that the former governor knows relatively little beyond that. He says Johnson prefers to focus on his obsessive fitness routine — he's an ultramarathoner and triathelete who summited Mount Everest in 2003 after leaving office as governor— rather than learn about unfamiliar areas like foreign policy. "Running for president, I don't care where you're governor, it's very different and you need to have a degree of intellectual curiosity," Adair said. "He doesn't have that." Supporters and admirers in New Mexico agree that Johnson was an unusual politician. He didn't horse trade or hold grudges, they say, and was generally direct and honest. Those are attributes that have won him an unusually wide swath of support in the current presidential race, helping him appeal both to some disaffected liberal Bernie Sanders voters and more traditional libertarians. He and running mate Bill Weld, Massachusetts' former GOP governor, are the only third-party ticket on the ballot in all 50 states Johnson has fallen short of the 15 percent threshold in national polling needed to enter the presidential debates, polling at about 8 percent for several months. If he receives 5 percent of the vote in November, that would be a bonanza for the Libertarian Party, assuring it of a valuable place on state ballots in the 2020 election. Johnson's deer-in-the-headlights response to a question from a television interviewer about what he'd do to deal with the crisis in the Syrian city of Aleppo — "What's Aleppo?" — earned him derision in September, though he quickly apologized. Weeks later, Democrats feared Johnson was pulling enough young voters from Clinton to throw some swing states to Trump. Johnson's campaign put out a lengthy statement urging Republicans disgusted with Trump's taped boasts about forcing himself on women to vote Libertarian instead. Johnson says he's happy to criticize Clinton, even though his running mate says his focus is solely on Trump. In an interview at a hotel near his Santa Fe home, Johnson predicted the national debt would more than double to $50 trillion should Clinton implement her various plans. She's proposed spending that would be paid for by $1.4 trillion in tax increases on the wealthy. Johnson said those would doom the economy. "If those tax hikes go through, I think the recession of 2008 is mild by comparison," Johnson said. Johnson was born in North Dakota, but his father moved the family to New Mexico when the future governor was 13. Raised by a school teacher and an accountant for the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, Johnson founded a construction company while he was still at the University of New Mexico. The firm grew and became a major contractor on Intel's chip factory in Albuquerque, making Johnson his fortune. In 1994 he entered a competitive four-way Republican primary for governor. Johnson squeaked through with just over 30 percent of the primary vote, then defeated an incumbent Democrat whose party was so badly split that his own lieutenant governor ran against him. The new Republican governor confronted a Democratic-controlled legislature and it was ugly. Johnson vetoed more than half of the bills that came to his desk that first year and kept rejecting ones afterward. "When you have both houses of the legislature in the opposite party you're always going to have a lot of sparks that fly, especially on financial issues," said David Harris, Johnson's longtime finance secretary. "He always applied the same test to everything," Harris added — veto it "if it didn't improve the government or it raised taxes." Over the years Johnson routinely shot down efforts to create commemorative license plates that would collect extra money for wildlife preservation, firefighters or West Point graduates. He vetoed a proposal for a state holiday recognizing Hispanic labor icon Cesar Chavez. He vetoed a $2 hotel room fee increase in the city of Las Cruces. He even vetoed the entire budget in his final year only to have the legislature override him. In the end, Johnson had limited success reining in state spending — the budget still grew from $4.4 billion in his first year to $7.7 billion in his last. But even his critics acknowledge it would have been far higher without him. "He was just a very results-oriented guy and there's some utility in his view that doing more does not mean delivering more," said Doug Turner, who ran Johnson's re-election race. Johnson also championed school choice, brought private prisons to the state, implemented managed care in the state's Medicare program and built a new highway to New Mexico's western edge. But it was his push to legalize marijuana, announced shortly after his 1998 re-election, that made him famous. A longtime marijuana user, Johnson said he was persuaded to end the drug war by watching the escalating costs to courts, police and jails from locking up addicts. He wasn't able to persuade the legislature to decriminalize marijuana but came away with more money for drug treatment programs. After leaving office, Johnson pushed for marijuana legalization and founded a marijuana branding company. In 2011, he ran for the GOP presidential nomination. But he was largely ignored in the race and switched to the Libertarian ticket. He received 1 percent of the vote in 2012. Johnson rarely dealt with issues like gay marriage or immigration as governor, but he emphasizes them in this campaign, effectively merging the small-government, non-interventionist libertarianism of Ron Paul with a more socially liberal message. One of the more emotional moments in his rallies usually comes when he announces that "Black Lives Matter" — often to cheers from the largely white audience — and rattles off statistics about the way the justice system treats African-Americans. Johnson is also a non-interventionist, one of his greatest areas of difference with Clinton. He argues that the military could be one-fifth smaller, especially if it pulled back from overseas areas where he says it doesn't need to be, like Japan. He recently said Syria's civil war has been worsened by the U.S. arming some of the rebels and said he wouldn't push for safe zones for civilians in besieged Aleppo, where the U.S. government has accused Russia of targeting civilians to help Syria's government. "That's just opening another conflict with Russia," Johnson said. (This story has not been edited by economictimes.com and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)

Detractors considered him narrow-minded and incurious about the outside world. "He just does not believe government should be involved in dealing with social problems," said state Sen. Jerry Pino y Ortiz, who ran two social service agencies during Johnson's administration and feels the former governor let down his achingly poor state. "It's like the dad who's proud that his kid gets by on the smallest allowance at school, but the kid's shoes have holes in them." Rod Adair is a Republican political strategist and former state lawmaker who agrees with Johnson's small-government philosophy. The problem, Adair said, is that the former governor knows relatively little beyond that. He says Johnson prefers to focus on his obsessive fitness routine — he's an ultramarathoner and triathelete who summited Mount Everest in 2003 after leaving office as governor— rather than learn about unfamiliar areas like foreign policy. "Running for president, I don't care where you're governor, it's very different and you need to have a degree of intellectual curiosity," Adair said. "He doesn't have that." Supporters and admirers in New Mexico agree that Johnson was an unusual politician. He didn't horse trade or hold grudges, they say, and was generally direct and honest. Those are attributes that have won him an unusually wide swath of support in the current presidential race, helping him appeal both to some disaffected liberal Bernie Sanders voters and more traditional libertarians. He and running mate Bill Weld, Massachusetts' former GOP governor, are the only third-party ticket on the ballot in all 50 states Johnson has fallen short of the 15 percent threshold in national polling needed to enter the presidential debates, polling at about 8 percent for several months. If he receives 5 percent of the vote in November, that would be a bonanza for the Libertarian Party, assuring it of a valuable place on state ballots in the 2020 election. Johnson's deer-in-the-headlights response to a question from a television interviewer about what he'd do to deal with the crisis in the Syrian city of Aleppo — "What's Aleppo?" — earned him derision in September, though he quickly apologized. Weeks later, Democrats feared Johnson was pulling enough young voters from Clinton to throw some swing states to Trump. Johnson's campaign put out a lengthy statement urging Republicans disgusted with Trump's taped boasts about forcing himself on women to vote Libertarian instead. Johnson says he's happy to criticize Clinton, even though his running mate says his focus is solely on Trump. In an interview at a hotel near his Santa Fe home, Johnson predicted the national debt would more than double to $50 trillion should Clinton implement her various plans. She's proposed spending that would be paid for by $1.4 trillion in tax increases on the wealthy. Johnson said those would doom the economy. "If those tax hikes go through, I think the recession of 2008 is mild by comparison," Johnson said. Johnson was born in North Dakota, but his father moved the family to New Mexico when the future governor was 13. Raised by a school teacher and an accountant for the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, Johnson founded a construction company while he was still at the University of New Mexico. The firm grew and became a major contractor on Intel's chip factory in Albuquerque, making Johnson his fortune. In 1994 he entered a competitive four-way Republican primary for governor. Johnson squeaked through with just over 30 percent of the primary vote, then defeated an incumbent Democrat whose party was so badly split that his own lieutenant governor ran against him. The new Republican governor confronted a Democratic-controlled legislature and it was ugly. Johnson vetoed more than half of the bills that came to his desk that first year and kept rejecting ones afterward. "When you have both houses of the legislature in the opposite party you're always going to have a lot of sparks that fly, especially on financial issues," said David Harris, Johnson's longtime finance secretary. "He always applied the same test to everything," Harris added — veto it "if it didn't improve the government or it raised taxes." Over the years Johnson routinely shot down efforts to create commemorative license plates that would collect extra money for wildlife preservation, firefighters or West Point graduates. He vetoed a proposal for a state holiday recognizing Hispanic labor icon Cesar Chavez. He vetoed a $2 hotel room fee increase in the city of Las Cruces. He even vetoed the entire budget in his final year only to have the legislature override him. In the end, Johnson had limited success reining in state spending — the budget still grew from $4.4 billion in his first year to $7.7 billion in his last. But even his critics acknowledge it would have been far higher without him. "He was just a very results-oriented guy and there's some utility in his view that doing more does not mean delivering more," said Doug Turner, who ran Johnson's re-election race. Johnson also championed school choice, brought private prisons to the state, implemented managed care in the state's Medicare program and built a new highway to New Mexico's western edge. But it was his push to legalize marijuana, announced shortly after his 1998 re-election, that made him famous. A longtime marijuana user, Johnson said he was persuaded to end the drug war by watching the escalating costs to courts, police and jails from locking up addicts. He wasn't able to persuade the legislature to decriminalize marijuana but came away with more money for drug treatment programs. After leaving office, Johnson pushed for marijuana legalization and founded a marijuana branding company. In 2011, he ran for the GOP presidential nomination. But he was largely ignored in the race and switched to the Libertarian ticket. He received 1 percent of the vote in 2012. Johnson rarely dealt with issues like gay marriage or immigration as governor, but he emphasizes them in this campaign, effectively merging the small-government, non-interventionist libertarianism of Ron Paul with a more socially liberal message. One of the more emotional moments in his rallies usually comes when he announces that "Black Lives Matter" — often to cheers from the largely white audience — and rattles off statistics about the way the justice system treats African-Americans. Johnson is also a non-interventionist, one of his greatest areas of difference with Clinton. He argues that the military could be one-fifth smaller, especially if it pulled back from overseas areas where he says it doesn't need to be, like Japan. He recently said Syria's civil war has been worsened by the U.S. arming some of the rebels and said he wouldn't push for safe zones for civilians in besieged Aleppo, where the U.S. government has accused Russia of targeting civilians to help Syria's government. "That's just opening another conflict with Russia," Johnson said. In this Monday, Oct. 10, 2016 photo, Libertarian presidential candidate and former New Mexico Gov.

Learn the 13 Questions You Must Ask Your Bot Mitigation Vendor to Secure Your Website Only thirty-three percent of IT security professionals have security strategies in place to protect the growing number of endpoints on their networks, according to a recent study conducted by Dimensional Research among 500 IT security pros. Are you confident that all the devices connected to your network receive security updates in a timely fashion? Sixty percent of the respondents said they are not confident that all of the devices connected to their networks receive security updates in a timely fashion. “Timely application of security updates is one of the most effective ways to reduce risk in any organization, but it remains a widespread challenge,” said Tim Erlin, senior director of IT security and risk strategy for Tripwire. “As more diverse devices are deployed, the availability and management of these updates becomes more difficult. Organizations need to have a strategy now, before an incident occurs.” Critical endpoints are systems that, if compromised, could have significant fiscal or operational impact on an organization. Endpoints have traditionally been defined as devices with which users interact, such as desktops, tablets or phones; however, this definition has now been expanded to include additional items like employee-owned devices, virtual machines, point-of-sale terminals, Internet of Things devices and servers. Despite presenting significant and unique security risks, critical endpoints are rapidly increasing on networks. Intel has projected there will be over 200 billion connected devices by 2020. Are you concerned about the security of IoT devices connecting to your organization’s network? Additional findings: Twenty-one percent of the respondents consider the security of IoT devices connecting to their organization’s networks to be one of their top security concerns. Nearly one-third (thirty-one percent) of the respondents said they conduct comprehensive inventories of hardware- and software-based assets, including IoT devices, on their networks only once per year. Fifty-two percent of the respondents said the projected growth rate of endpoints on their organization’s networks over the next 24 months would be less than twenty-five percent per year. “The proliferation of devices from BYOD, IoT, and the incidental use of personal devices in the enterprise is causing ‘device sprawl,’ so it’s no surprise enterprises aren’t keeping up,” said Dwayne Melancon, vice president of products at Tripwire. “The key to dealing with this risk is to remember that foundational controls still apply, regardless of scale – know what’s on your network, understand how it’s vulnerable, keep it patched, keep it securely configured, and monitor the heck out of it for suspicious activity.” Tags BYOD endpoint security strategy survey Tripwire Critical Linux bug opens systems to compromise Key causes of network outages and vulnerabilities Weave a web of deception to secure data Researchers reveal WiFi-based mobile password discovery attack Compromised: 339 million AdultFriendFinder users Spot light Why Unidirectional Security Gateways can replace firewalls in industrial network environments What's New Mobile pros are addicted to Wi-Fi, connectivity impacts their choices Cloud adoption hits all-time high, Microsoft and Google dominate Facebook, Google ban fake news sources from their ad networks Preparing for the holiday shopping season?

It's also staggeringly light at just 2.48 pounds, and if you've been waiting for this beauty to show up, we have good news—the Swift 7 is now available to order in the U.S. starting at $1,099. The Swift 7 owes its ultra-thin and featherweight status to its aluminum unibody design. Acer didn't stop there, though, giving the Swift 7 a fantastic looking gold inner surface that contrasts nicely with its matte black exterior, at least from what we can tell from the press photos (we've yet to spy one of these systems in person). There's more here than just a beautiful frame, the Swift 7 bring some brawn as well. The first model available in the Swift 7 series (SF713-51-M90J) features a 13.3-inch Full HD 1080p display (1920x1080) with an In-Plane Switching Panel powered by a 7th Generation Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor based on Intel's recently introduced Kaby Lake architecture. The introductory model also boasts 8GB of LPDDR3 memory and a 256GB solid state drive, giving it a capable foundation to serve as an everyday workhorse. We don't suspect the CPU and integrated graphics are up to the task of handling intense content creation chores, but as a general purpose productivity machine with multimedia chops, the Swift 7 will probably suffice. Other features include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, an HDR webcam, two USB 3.1 Type-C ports (albeit Gen 1), a 4-cell (2,770 mAh) battery that Acer says is good for 9 hours of run time, and Windows 10 64-bit. Standard (Type-A) USB ports are noticeably missing from the configuration, and in that way the Swift 7 is like Apple's MacBook. However, the Swift 7 brings two USB 3.1 Type-C ports to the table rather than just one, the distinction there being you can charge the Swift 7 while still having access to a USB 3.1 port without using an adapter. The Swift 7 is available to order now direct from Acer.

However, the company’s shares, which are listed in London, slipped by around 0.5%. The shares have nonetheless risen strongly this year, climbing 23% despite the potential challenges of Brexit. Merrion Capital analyst Darren McKinley said the acquisition costs represented a multiple of six times Hammer’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation, and met “DCC’s investment criteria”. The acquisition should benefit group operating profit by around 2% to 3%, Mr McKinley said. DCC said Hammer posted operating profits of £6.3m and sales of £155m in the 12 months to the end of January. Hammer distributes servers for manufacturers across Europe including Dell, NetApp, Seagate, Intel, and Western Digital, and will help DCC tap growth in cloud data centres, said chief executive Tommy Breen. The acquisition “underpins management’s commitment to a division that has struggled in the recent past — 29% year—year decline in full-year 2016 operating profit — relative to energy and healthcare in particular,” said Gerry Hennigan, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2014, file photo, American flags fly in front of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are falling early Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, and following global markets lower after a steep drop in China’s exports, a troubling sign for the second-largest economy in the world. Banks and mining companies are taking some of the largest losses. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks gave up large gains and finished barely higher Friday. Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers.

The report on consumer spending indicated consumers are once again parting with their cash. The financial sector led Friday’s gainers with healthcare acting as the big drag. WTI crude oil for November delivery settled at $50.35 a barrel, down 0.2% for the day but up 1.1% for the week. December gold closed down 0.2% on the day to settle at $1,255.50 and still managed to hang onto a 0.3% gain for the week. Equities were headed for a higher close before the bell as the DJIA traded up by 0.38% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.22%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.16%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Friday was The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) which traded up 2.09% at $170.92. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $199.90. Trading volume was about 40% above the daily average of around 2.6 million. The investment bank dodged a $1 billion lawsuit loss in Britain and peer big banks reported decent earnings today, boosting hopes for Goldman’s results due next week.. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) traded up 1.42% at $37.50. The stock’s 52-week range is $27.68 to $38.36. Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 21.5 million shares.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 percent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 percent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 percent, to $98.50.

It may also drive smaller trucking firms out of business. A trucking industry survey earlier this year of mostly small operators found that 84 percent lacked electronic logs, according to load-matching firm truckstop.com. Paper logs allow transport companies already facing razor thin margins to fudge the books, boosting their hours on the road to help the bottom line. But a mandated switch to a digital system by late December 2017, regulators say, will boost safety by preventing exhausted truckers from driving. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) forecasts the regulation would save 26 lives per year and prevent 562 injuries. An FMCSA cost-benefit analysis found the new rule would cost truck firms $1.8 billion across the sector to implement, but fewer crashes and less paperwork would save $3 billion. Industry experts argue that whatever those savings, the smaller firms and independent owner operators that are the backbone of a highly fragmented market will take a productivity hit, making it difficult to pay off their trucks that have doubled in price since 2000. As a result, small to mid-size trucking outfits will need to find more drivers to haul the same amount of freight — and seek other ways to cut costs — in order to make it. “Some of the smaller (trucking) companies are just not going to survive” the change to electronic logs, said Dan Clark, head of BMO Transportation Finance, North America’s largest truck and trailer financing company. The biggest truck firms back the rule and have used electronic logs for years. Large outfits like Schneider National, Swift Transportation Co. and Covenant Transportation Group Inc. all say the new logs reduce truckers’ miles on the road. Cutting down driver miles means higher spending for additional drivers to haul freight. That leads to higher prices for consumers unless the firms find ways to squeeze more productivity out of their trucks. According to an FMCSA analysis, the rules will affect nearly 3.4 million drivers. Larger firms with better economies of scale like Werner Enterprises Inc have seen their productivity cut between 3 and 5 percent by electronic logs. Estimates vary up to 15 percent for how much productivity could fall at America’s small trucking outfits. Industry lobby group the American Trucking Associations (ATA) estimates the sector is short about 50,000 drivers. Electronic logging could leave the industry short 1 million drivers, according to industry tracker FTR Intel. The pending change has U.S. railroads hoping to take market share from the sector. CSX Corp Chief Executive Michael Ward said “won’t impact the big truck firms because they follow the law today, but it will affect small firms.” “This will be a positive for us,” Ward said. Biggest Hit Since Deregulation Though it does not kick in until the end of next year and is being challenged in court by an independent truck driver association for violating driver privacy, executives are already bracing for the new rule’s impact. “This will be the single biggest thing to hit our industry since deregulation,” in 1980, which reduced government controls on trucking rates and routes, says Chris Lofgren, CEO of Schneider National, whose customers include Walmart Stores Inc and Home Depot Inc. Schneider, the biggest private U.S. trucking company with annual revenue of around $4 billion, offers flexible schedules for drivers who want weekends at home, or longer routes with more money. “I get the routes I want so I can eat up the miles,” said Bob Wyatt, 68, a Schneider driver who has 4.9 million safe miles on the road. Truck makers are racing to make automatic vehicles that are easier and more comfortable to drive to help with driver retention. Denny Mooney, head of global product development at truck maker Navistar said he has heard from customers that say, “‘if our drivers don’t want to drive your trucks, we won’t buy your trucks.'” Green Bay-based Schneider is also putting customers under more scrutiny. Last year, Schneider rolled out an app for drivers to rate customers, enabling Schneider to fix problems or drop accounts that consistently chew up driver time. Rival J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. is doing the same, after its own report last year found on a good day time wasted on picking up and dropping off loads can cost a trucker two hours out of a daily limit of 11 hours driving time, or 100 miles on the road. Drivers get paid by the mile and log an average of 7,500 miles per month in 2015. That focus on getting more efficient is one reason why Troy Clarke, CEO of truck maker Navistar, said he is not convinced electronic logging will lead to truck sale spike. Instead, he said, truckers “will address capacity problems through an increased focus on productivity.” Schneider is focused on building closer relationships with thousands of smaller carriers through its brokerage business to boost capacity. The company expects more long-term contracts like one it has executed with Home Depot. Traditionally, pricing power seesaws between customers and truckers depending on the economy. Schneider’s deal with Home Depot keeps rates per mile more steady, and guarantees the home improvement chain access to trucking capacity. “We believe capacity is going to get tighter and tighter,” said Erin Van Zeeland, vice president of transportation management at Schneider. “We believe the one that has the truck, wins.” (Editing by Joseph White and Edward Tobin)   Copyright 2016 Reuters.

The trucking industry is short on drivers and a new regulation mandating truckers switch to electronic logs is expected to make the shortage far worse. REUTERS/Nick CareyMore By Nick Carey GREEN BAY, Wisc. (Reuters) - A new regulation that will force U.S. trucking companies to electronically log employee hours is designed to limit accidents by keeping tired drivers off the road. It may also drive smaller trucking firms out of business. A trucking industry survey earlier this year of mostly small operators found that 84 percent lacked electronic logs, according to load-matching firm truckstop.com. Paper logs allow transport companies already facing razor thin margins to fudge the books, boosting their hours on the road to help the bottom line. But a mandated switch to a digital system by late December 2017, regulators say, will boost safety by preventing exhausted truckers from driving. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) forecasts the regulation would save 26 lives per year and prevent 562 injuries. An FMCSA cost-benefit analysis found the new rule would cost truck firms $1.8 billion across the sector to implement, but fewer crashes and less paperwork would save $3 billion. Industry experts argue that whatever those savings, the smaller firms and independent owner operators that are the backbone of a highly fragmented market will take a productivity hit, making it difficult to pay off their trucks that have doubled in price since 2000. As a result, small to mid-size trucking outfits will need to find more drivers to haul the same amount of freight -- and seek other ways to cut costs -- in order to make it. "Some of the smaller (trucking) companies are just not going to survive" the change to electronic logs, said Dan Clark, head of BMO Transportation Finance, North America's largest truck and trailer financing company. The biggest truck firms back the rule and have used electronic logs for years. Large outfits like Schneider National, Swift Transportation Co <SWFT.N> and Covenant Transportation Group Inc <CVTI.O> all say the new logs reduce truckers' miles on the road. Cutting down driver miles means higher spending for additional drivers to haul freight. That leads to higher prices for consumers unless the firms find ways to squeeze more productivity out of their trucks. According to an FMCSA analysis, the rules will affect nearly 3.4 million drivers. Larger firms with better economies of scale like Werner Enterprises Inc <WERN.O> have seen their productivity cut between 3 and 5 percent by electronic logs. Estimates vary up to 15 percent for how much productivity could fall at America's small trucking outfits. Industry lobby group the American Trucking Associations (ATA) estimates the sector is short about 50,000 drivers. Electronic logging could leave the industry short 1 million drivers, according to industry tracker FTR Intel. The pending change has U.S. railroads hoping to take market share from the sector. CSX Corp <CSX.O> Chief Executive Michael Ward said "won't impact the big truck firms because they follow the law today, but it will affect small firms." "This will be a positive for us," Ward said. "THE ONE THAT HAS THE TRUCK, WINS" Though it does not kick in until the end of next year and is being challenged in court by an independent truck driver association for violating driver privacy, executives are already bracing for the new rule's impact. "This will be the single biggest thing to hit our industry since deregulation," in 1980, which reduced government controls on trucking rates and routes, says Chris Lofgren, CEO of Schneider National, whose customers include Walmart Stores Inc <WMT.N> and Home Depot Inc <HD.N>. Schneider, the biggest private U.S. trucking company with annual revenue of around $4 billion, offers flexible schedules for drivers who want weekends at home, or longer routes with more money. "I get the routes I want so I can eat up the miles,” said Bob Wyatt, 68, a Schneider driver who has 4.9 million safe miles on the road. Truck makers are racing to make automatic vehicles that are easier and more comfortable to drive to help with driver retention. Denny Mooney, head of global product development at truck maker Navistar <NAV.N> said he has heard from customers that say, "'if our drivers don't want to drive your trucks, we won't buy your trucks.'" Green Bay-based Schneider is also putting customers under more scrutiny. Last year, Schneider rolled out an app for drivers to rate customers, enabling Schneider to fix problems or drop accounts that consistently chew up driver time. Rival J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc <JBHT.O> is doing the same, after its own report last year found on a good day time wasted on picking up and dropping off loads can cost a trucker two hours out of a daily limit of 11 hours driving time, or 100 miles on the road. Drivers get paid by the mile and log an average of 7,500 miles per month in 2015. That focus on getting more efficient is one reason why Troy Clarke, CEO of truck maker Navistar, said he is not convinced electronic logging will lead to truck sale spike. Instead, he said, truckers “will address capacity problems through an increased focus on productivity.” Read More Schneider is focused on building closer relationships with thousands of smaller carriers through its brokerage business to boost capacity. The company expects more long-term contracts like one it has executed with Home Depot <HD.N>. Traditionally, pricing power seesaws between customers and truckers depending on the economy. Schneider's deal with Home Depot keeps rates per mile more steady, and guarantees the home improvement chain access to trucking capacity. "We believe capacity is going to get tighter and tighter,"said Erin Van Zeeland, vice president of transportation management at Schneider. "We believe the one that has the truck, wins."

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 per cent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 per cent from 1.75 per cent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 per cent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 per cent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 per cent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 per cent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 per cent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 per cent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 per cent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 per cent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 per cent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 per cent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 per cent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 per cent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 per cent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 per cent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 per cent this week. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business The Canadian Press 2016         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   NTT Communications, NTTWEM and NTT FINANCE Launch New Submarine Cable-Laying Ship "Kizuna" VersaBank and PWC Capital Inc.

THIS STORY Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated October 14, 2016 9:33AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Hewlett Packard IBM Data Center Servers Big Data Enterprise IT Top Tech News Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM are among nine tech giants coming together to promote a new standard for data center servers. Designed to speed up server performance, the OpenCAPI specification is aimed at helping businesses better handle today's increasingly data-intensive workloads. Working together as part of the new OpenCAPI Consortium, the industry partners said they expect that the first products based on the new standards will hit the market in the second half of 2017. By applying new data-centric standards to server design, OpenCAPI can reduce complexity, eliminate inefficiencies in current architectures and bring compute power "closer to the data," the consortium said. The group said the specification enables data transfer rates of 25 GB per second, compared to the top speed of 16 GB per second enabled under current standards established by the Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group. 'Game-Changing Technology' The name OpenCAPI comes from "Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface," a technology developed by IBM to speed up server performance through its Power microprocessor architecture. IN 2013, several tech companies, including Mellanox, Nvidia and Tyan, teamed up with IBM to form the OpenPower Consortium to promote development of technologies that support that architecture. Mellanox and Nvidia are also among the companies joining the new OpenCAPI Consortium. Other founding members include AMD, Dell EMC, Micron and Xilinx. Since IBM launched CAPI, "the industry has embraced and validated its potential as a game-changing technology for the most important modern workloads including artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics and deep learning," IBM Power Development vice president Brad McCredie said yesterday in a statement. "As a result of this initial success, IBM has decided to double down on our commitment to open standards and enablement of industry innovation by opening up access to our CAPI technology to the entire industry." "This is big, really big," Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst of Moor Insights and Strategy, wrote today in Forbes. "Acceleration is what all the cool kids are doing." New Products Expected Next Year Yesterday's news comes on the heels of Tuesday's announcement about the formation of the Gen-Z Consortium, another industry group aimed at developing and promoting high-performance IT. That organization will focus on creating and commercializing ways to support large volumes of data via a peer-to-peer interconnect that also reduces data processing bottlenecks and costs. Notably absent from the OpenCAPI Consortium and the Gen-Z Consortium is Intel. TechWeek Europe noted today that it's likely that Intel will "explore its own ways to improve server performance for emerging workloads and keep its specifications under wraps rather than release them into the open source world." Businesses across many industries, including financial services, medical services, Internet services, manufacturing and retail, today face "an immediate need" for faster, better computing performance, according to the OpenCAPI Consortium. That need is being driven by their use of ever-more data-intensive workloads such as advanced analytics, machine learning and other emerging technologies to improve global competitiveness. Sometime in the second half of next year, IBM said it expects to launch new Power9-based servers that use the OpenCAPI standard. In addition, Google and Rackspace are working together on a new server technology, codename Zaius, that will use the Power9 technology and OpenCAPI standard, while Xilinx plans to support the standard with new OpenCAPI-enabled field-programmable gate arrays.

Student-Led Cybersecurity Games: NYU CSAW News provided by NYU Tandon School of Engineering Oct 14, 2016, 11:51 ET Share this article BROOKLYN, N.Y., Oct. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- More than 20 teams of high school students in the United States and the United Arab Emirates have won coveted slots to compete in the world's largest set of student-led cybersecurity contests, the New York University Tandon School of Engineering's annual Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) games. For the first time, the final round of the High School Forensics Challenge (HSF) will be held simultaneously at NYU Tandon in Downtown Brooklyn and NYU Abu Dhabi. The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur) will simultaneously host other CSAW contests for the India-wide finals. Together, the three regional CSAW hubs will bring hundreds of high school and collegiate finalists, mentors, recruiters, cybersecurity professionals, and top academics to the 13th annual CSAW, November 10-12, 2016. The HSF finalists in the U.S. regionals will be awarded a scholarship (contingent on admission to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and maintenance of satisfactory academic progress) and will receive cash prizes for their high schools provided by a grant from the U.S. National Security Agency.  NYU Abu Dhabi HSF winners will receive scholarships and travel to prestigious summer educational programs and university letters of recommendation. In the U.S. the HSF Challenge preliminaries (September 28 to October 8, 2016) were divided into four regions, with the top-performing teams from the Midwest, West, South, and Northeast earning prizes to travel to NYU Tandon in Brooklyn to compete in the finals. Additionally, seven wildcard teams were invited based on their outstanding scores. The CSAW finalists from the United Arab Emirates were not selected by region but were the highest scoring teams.

Comments By Clint Boulton Follow CIO | Oct 14, 2016 7:42 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Virtual Reality Innovation IT Industry Vertical Industries Microsoft Comments Microsoft has enlisted the likes of Volvo, Lowes, Japan Airlines and ThyssenKrupp to test its HoloLens augmented reality (AR) headset, underscoring the software giant’s early success in wooing enterprises. Given Microsoft's prowess in fostering dominant platforms such as Windows and Office and its global reach you could argue that the software giant has the best shot at establishing the enterprise standard in AR. Gartner analyst Brian Blau, who tracks the AR/VR market, is taking a cautious view. He says that while Microsoft’s clout in business software give it an advantage it’s too early to proclaim a leader. Microsoft’s AR device, currently available to developers and businesses, costs $3,000, has some technical limitations and faces competition from a number of tech heavyweights that are building wearable AR and virtual reality ecosystems. Volvo sees a day when consumers will use Microsoft HoloLens to customize their cars in a virtual showroom. HoloLens, which vies with Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear, Sony Playstation VR and dozens of others in the high-stakes market for immersive headsets, uses cameras, air gestures, gaze, voice, and sound to navigate holograms that adapt to the physical surroundings, enabling people to access information and complete tasks hands-free. Thyssenkrupp technicians access Skype on HoloLens to call subject matter experts and share holographic instructions. HoloLens lures many business takers Attracted by the opportunity to enable employees to access information and complete tasks hands-free, several companies are building HoloLens applications. A handful include the following: Thyssenkrupp elevator service technicians use HoloLens to triage service requests ahead of maintenance visits and getting hands-free remote guidance when on site. Technicians access Skype on HoloLens to call subject matter experts and share holographic instructions In trials, Thyssenkrupp says HoloLens has reduced the average length of it service calls by four times. Volvo Cars envisions consumers using HoloLens to customize their cars in a virtual showroom. “Imagine using mixed reality to choose the type of car you want – to explore the colors, rims, or get a better understanding of the features, services and options available,” says Björn Annwall, Volvo’s senior vice president of marketing, sales and service. He says that HoloLens could open up new sales channels by allowing dealers to take a car configurator to pop-up stores or malls. Japan Airlines (JAL) has developed two proof-of-concept programs to train engine mechanics and flight crew trainees. Thanks to the 3D capabilities in HoloLens mechanics “can study and be trained just as if they were working on the actual engine or cockpit,” placing their hands on virtual engines and parts, says Koji Hayamizu, senior director of the planning group for JAL’s products and service administration department. Using HoloLens, flight crew trainees access a detailed hologram that will display cockpit devices and switches that they can operate themselves, with visual and voice guidance. Lowe’s customers are using HoloLensto view a holographic representation of a new kitchen and customize design options for kitchen cabinetry, countertops, appliances and other home features. They may also share their designs online. “A miniature hologram kitchen allows for a bird’s eye perspective of the kitchen,” says Microsoft’s Erickson. In-store designers and friends can view what the customer is seeing and changing in real time through a hand-held Surface tablet. Microsoft also is working with AECOM and Trimble Navigation to allow architects and engineers to view building construction and engineering schemas in 3D. AECOM says engineers and designers in London, Hong Kong and Denver, are exploring 3D buildings as if they were physical models on a table. Healthy skepticism abounds Such commercial scenarios underscore why Microsoft is confident in its ability to make HoloLens the VR standard for commercial industry. And the currently modest market for AR/VR devices is set to boom. Forrester Research estimates that 52million units of VR head-mounted displays will be used by enterprises and by consumers use in the U.S. by 2020. AECOM engineers and designers in London, Hong Kong and Denver are exploring 3D buildings as if they were physical models. But analysts aren’t ready to proclaim HoloLens as the go-to device for enterprises. Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder says that while HoloLens is an important device, it has several limitations, including its $3,000 price tag. It’s also heavy – you won’t want to wear it for more than two hours. It also has a narrow field of view and can’t be used outside in bright light. However, Gownder expects Windows Holographic will eventually lead to new form factors. “I would be looking to new Windows Holographic devices from Microsoft's partners that solve those problems,” Gownder says. Gartner’s Blau says a new collaboration between Microsoft and Intel raises questions about HoloLens’ future. Last month, Intel unveiled Project Alloy, the chipmaker’s bid to create an all-in-one VR display that is similar to HoloLens. Microsoft agreed to optimize Windows content and experiences in Intel’s Alloy device and the two companies will help foster a range of AR/VR devices for business and consumer markets. “We don’t know if that is the future of HoloLens, if HoloLens gets merged into whatever Project Alloy is,” Blau says. Microsoft is expected to unveil more details about its collaboration with Intel, as well as OEM partnerships, at WinHEC in December. What Blau is certain of is that AR/VR leaders will include global ecosystem vendors, such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook and Samsung, which have cultivated platforms in mobile, cloud, social and other key technology categories. “The same [ecosystem phenomenon] is going to happen in immersive technology,” Blau says. Microsoft, which, added mobile device management, Azure Active Directory support, BitLocker data encryption and VPN remote access, to make HoloLens more appealing to enterprises, remains confident in its position. “HoloLens is on a multi-year journey and we are currently focused on developers and enterprise scenarios,” Scott Erickson, general manager of Microsoft HoloLens, tells CIO.com via email.
