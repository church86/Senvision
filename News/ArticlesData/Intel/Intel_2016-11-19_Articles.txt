We have hardly had time to take in the economic trauma of Brexit. Now we have Donald Trump's equally unexpected victory in the US presidential election. During the US campaign, Irish observers may have found Trump's malevolent banter about "crooked Hillary" and his outrageous coiffure compelling, but The Donald phenomenon did not seem to have much to do with us. Google in Dublin at the Grand Canal. Photo: Steve Humphreys His victory seemed so unlikely that few took time to study his policies, including his plan to lure US multinationals back home from Ireland by dropping the corporate tax rate from 35pc to 15pc. Now, if some predictions prove correct, that could become a reality. The American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland, which represents the companies involved, was quick to offer reassurances that we are not about to suffer a mass 'Trexit' of companies. To Mark Redmond, chief executive of the chamber, Ireland's attractions to US are not all about tax. "US business leaders in Ireland view talent as the main reason why companies invest here," he said this week. There is a lot at stake for Ireland, as US multinationals currently employ 140,000 people. In areas dominated by these American corporate behemoths, it is not just the employees themselves who are utterly dependent on the US paymasters. It is also the vast network of linked companies and small businesses around them. Read more: Bannon is 'most dangerous political operative in the US' As well as employing 4,500 in Leixlip, Intel has depended on 756 Irish suppliers since it opened in 1989. The company supplies computers to local schools and offers scholarships. It subsidises sports clubs and the local Tidy Towns group. Apple employs 4,000 people in Cork, mostly at its Holyhill plant, but it is estimated that a further 2,500 people depend on the tech giant for their livelihood - from the makers of components, to builders working on the plants, to the fishmonger Pat O'Connell from the city's English Market who supplies the canteen. Around Dublin's Silicon Docks this week, there was understandable consternation at any suggestion that big US multinationals would be tempted to move. A whole economy of coffee shops, restaurants and swanky apartments has grown up around the hi-tech cluster that includes Google, Facebook, Linkedin and many other companies. In his thriving barbershop on Grand Canal Dock, Alan Austin says he's concerned by the latest developments, and Trump's promise to cut taxes in the US. "I would be absolutely devastated if any of these companies moved," says the Austin, who welcomes hundreds of the casually-attired employees from the nearby tech companies. He opened his first barbershop just as the economy was about to crash in 2008, but he couldn't have picked a better place. While businesses elsewhere went belly up, and property prices collapsed, Google continued to grow and with other companies eventually arriving, Silicon Docks was dubbed the most potent symbol of Ireland's economic recovery. We may complain about their low taxes, but Austin believes the multinationals kept businesses ticking over during the recession. Alan McQuaid, economist with Merrion Capital, agrees. "I would say that during the financial crisis that without the multinationals, the Irish economy would have been well and truly knackered," he says. But now the doomsayers warn that if Trump and his acolytes do what they say they want to do, it could be the biggest threat to Irish prosperity since the crash - and its effects could be deeper and more long-term. Read more: Do you have TDS? (Trump Derangement Syndrome) There were alarm bells in recent days when one of Trump's top economic advisors, Stephen Moore, issued a stark warning after the election. The man who helped devise Trump's economic policies warned that a "flood of companies" will leave Ireland under the President-elect's planned new tax regime. The news comes after Brexit, which has already led to the collapse of some Irish businesses, and seen a flood of shoppers crossing the Border to snap up bargains. Trump himself has described his successful movement as "Brexit Plus, Plus, Plus". Would the multinational jobs really be under threat if Trump succeeds in pushing through his measures? If we want to read the tea leaves and predict our economic future, we should perhaps ignore the humdrum goings-on in the Dáil. Instead, we should watch the real -life House of Cards drama playing out in New York and Washington, as right-wingers jostle for position in the US government. The wrangling was described as a "knife fight" by CNN as different factions fought for positions. Part of Ireland's future may rest on which faction wins out, and whether they wish to go along with the massive corporate tax cut. According to some estimates, it could cost the US government up to $9 trillion over the next decade to implement it. "It is not clear what Trump will be able to do, because he is just the president, and at the end of the day he still has to get things passed through Congress. Obama also made noises about changing corporation tax, but nothing much came of it because it was blocked," says Dr Edgar Morgenroth, economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). Dr Morgenroth believes that even if the US corporate tax is lowered to 15pc, it is unlikely to have a dramatic effect in the short term. Massive corporations have spent billions opening factories and office complexes in Ireland in recent years "If you have spent a lot of money on a new headquarters and hired staff and everything is going okay, you're not just going to suddenly say 'We're out of here'." The economist says changes to corporate tax rates may have an effect in the long term, however. While Google and Apple might stay, some economists believe there will be less incentive for US companies to move their operation over here. Dr Morgenroth says the negative effect of the Trump phenomenon is that it has increased uncertainty in Ireland. "Uncertainty is a bad thing, because people can't make decisions on investment if they don't know what is going to happen." He says Ireland now finds itself in an uncomfortable place, with the difficulties caused by Brexit, and pressures from the European Commission to change our system of corporation tax, combining with the Trump phenomenon. As one commentator joked this week: "Ireland is in a difficult position. There's Trump to the left us, Brexit to the right. We're stuck in the middle with the EU." The future of new investment by American companies in Ireland may be uncertain as a result of the Trump measures, but companies such as Intel are deeply embedded. Leixlip county councillor Joe Neville was still a child when the plant was being built, and remembers being impressed by the spacesuit-like gear worn by the staff in the "clean rooms". "People of my generation grew up with it and four out of my 10 best friends work there. Both Intel and Hewlett Packard are very community oriented." Neville has seen for decades the effect of Intel on the economy in the area and says that hundreds of local people, apart from the employees, depend on the factory for their livelihood. "There are many people who work as contractors doing cleaning, landscaping and construction. "It is impossible to forecast what he will do. "Personally, I wasn't all that concerned when Trump won, because we have heard of proposals to cut the corporate-tax rate in America before, and it has never happened. "Obama talked of doing it and no doubt it could have been part of Hillary's agenda as well," Neville says of Trump's corporate-tax plans. Read more: 'Two Trump supporters asked me if I was legal... now I engage less with customers' In the short term, economists seem to be more concerned about the effects of Brexit than Trump's political soap opera. As well as trying to predict what might happen in Washington, they are observing what is happening in Number 10 Downing Street as the British Government tries to implement Brexit. A leaked memo prepared by the consultants Deloitte painted a picture of chaos at the heart of the British government, with splits between ministers and the civil service struggling to cope. "It is clear that they don't have a plan in London, and I don't know why anyone is even talking to them," Dr Morgenorth of the ESRI says. The economist predicts that there will be a "hard Brexit", which would mean much tighter restrictions on movement and trade between the UK and EU countries. So far, there has been little sign of a resolution to the question of what would happen to the Border between North and South. One notion that has been floated is the idea that Britain is seeking to shift the frontline of immigration controls to Ireland's ports and airports to avoid having to introduce a "hard border". But Dr Morgenroth describes this idea as "utter and total nonsense". He says it is quite possible that Britain will leave the customs union, the free trade area in the EU, and in that case there would have to be Border controls. The collapse of sterling in anticipation of Brexit has already hit Irish businesses, particularly in the food sector, as Irish exports to Britain have become less competitive. Up to five mushroom producers have gone out of business since Brexit. But even when Britain leaves the EU, and if Trump lowers corporation taxes, there may still be a silver lining for Ireland, according to economist McQuaid. "Ireland will be the gateway to Europe for US companies, and it will help us that we are the only English-speaking country in the EU." McQuaid says a 15pc corporate tax rate may be hard to implement in America. He points to differing opinions in the Republican party, with some influential figures advocating a 24pc rate. It is possible that a compromise will be reached with a figure of 20pc, but this is likely to be phased in over a long period. "We can't take things for granted, but this is not the end of the world by any means," McQuaid says.

Intel Vulkan Linux Driver Now Has Patches For Fast Clears Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 19 November 2016 at 05:29 PM EST. 2 Comments Building off the input attachments work earlier this week for the Intel open-source Vulkan driver (covered in More Intel ANV Vulkan Code Hits Mesa Git, Other Patches Pending), there are now patches up for review to implement support for fast clears. Jason Ekstrand at the Intel Open-Source Technology Center who has been leading the "ANV" Vulkan driver effort wrote this Saturday, "This little series builds on top of the input attachment series I sent out earlier this week and adds support for fast clears in Vulkan. I've tested it on both Sky Lake and Haswell and it has no regressions over the input attachments series." So fast clears are there, great to see it's supported back to Haswell compared to some ANV Vulkan driver features being enabled (at least initially) just for Skylake and newer. The patches don't comment on any performance changes as a result of the fast clears support, but at Phoronix there will be some fresh Intel Vulkan Linux benchmarks coming up shortly.

By Christina Beck, Staff November 19, 2016 Save for later Saved Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a Microsoft media event in New York, Oct. 26. Richard Drew/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Microsoft announced plans this week to tie executive bonuses to company success at meeting diversity hiring goals, after the number of female hires fell this fall. Silicon Valley has long been aware of its diversity problem, and a number of companies have instituted internal plans to achieve greater diversity. Nevertheless, the tech industry still suffers from a massive diversity gap, with minority groups and women making up a small fraction of new hires and corporate boards. Is Microsoft’s ambitious executive-reward program a credible path to progress for technology companies? Recommended: Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. Bonuses helped at Intel. In January 2015, Intel launched a $300 million diversity initiative, which included  bonuses for referring diverse applicants. This February, Intel announced that 43 percent of all new hires in 2015 were women or minority applicants, marking a massive success for the strategy. Test your knowledge Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Diversity experts say that companies must remain persistent and innovative in order to attract more minorities and women to Silicon Valley. “Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” Microsoft’s diversity and inclusion officer, Gwen Houston, told Bloomberg. At the industry level, diversity numbers are dismal. Just 15.5 percent of technology company board positions are held by women, reported The Christian Science Monitor's Ellen Powell in October. She wrote: Some of these struggles are societal: Young girls may be taught that engineering isn’t for them, or an absence of role models may make a computing career seem too far out of reach. Other issues are institutional. A study of open-source software-development website GitHub found that women are more likely to have their work accepted than men – but  only if their gender is unknown. Microsoft’s latest effort was inspired by this year’s decrease in the size of its female workforce. Numbers fell by one percentage point, from 26.8 to 25.8 percent, after the divestment of a Nokia factory that employed a number of women. Although the raw numbers are discouraging, however, Microsoft says that the company is also tracking positive trends. For example, the percentage of female workers in non-production sectors actually rose this year by about half a percent. And over the past year, Microsoft reports, more than a quarter of new hires were women. “We are encouraged by the modest gains we’re seeing in female representation in technical and leadership roles, and even more significantly, by the hiring trends of the past year that resulted from our efforts to recruit top-notch female talent,” wrote Ms. Houston in a Microsoft blog post. The tech company also saw tiny gains in diversity hiring, with African American representation at Microsoft growing from 3.5 to 3.7 percent of the company, and Hispanic/Latino representation increasing from 5.4 percent to 5.5 percent. Nevertheless, there is still far to go, says Microsoft. Hence the company’s effort to incentivize the hiring of women and ethnic or racial minorities by linking executive bonuses to diversity hiring. Technology companies face several obstacles in diversity efforts. The percentage of STEM degrees awarded to women has shrunk over the past several decades, from 37 percent of engineering graduating classes in the 1980s, to 19 percent today. Recruiting minority groups can also pose a problem. Microsoft’s announcement does not occur in a vacuum, however. A number of enterprising young people have independently developed groups and tools to encourage women and minorities to pursue tech careers, including the Technovation program at Immaculate Conception Academy, which confronts the cultural barriers that often keep women away from STEM fields. Innovation is also happening at the entrepreneurial level. In April, the Monitor’s Schuyler Velasco reported on such programs, including a firm called GapJumpers, which is dedicated to connecting qualified potential hires to companies through a blind screening process. Groups such as Girls Who Code are also working to break down industry barriers for women of all ages. Besides its executive compensation strategy, Microsoft’s new diversity push also involves diversity recruiting campaigns and investing in STEM programs to increase the applicant pool.

"Starbright Holidays" will feature 300 LED-lit dancing drones in the night sky. With the push of a button, the show begins, as 300 drones rise into the night sky over a nearby lake. You can't see them because it's dark, but you can hear the drone as they get into place in the formation. The music starts and the drones light up — the ballet begins, and the Ohhhs and Ahhhs soon follow, reports the South Florida Reporter. They also published this update from Disney: We’re excited to share an update that the first shows of “Starbright Holidays – An Intel Collaboration” will begin on November 20. You can see the nightly performances at Disney Springs at 7:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. from Nov. 20 – Jan 8. The aerial ballet is a collaboration between Disney and Intel, and the show is called, “Starbright Holidays — an Intel Collaboration.” The stars of the show are Intel's new Shooting Star quadcopters. Intel has done this sort of thing before, in Sydney earlier this year, they synched 500 drones. Shooting Star drones only weigh 280 grams. They have a tightly integrated LED payload built into a soft frame made of frangible materials such as flexible plastics and foam. Propellers are protected by covered cages. There are no screws. Intel Josh Walden, the general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, told Wired, “Our drones, together with Disney’s expertise in animation as well as storytelling, and the music score, together make what we think is going to be a groundbreaking form of entertainment." Disneyland and Walt Disney World had to get a special exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration because both are FAA designated no-fly zones. The exemption permits the park to operate the semi-autonomous drones until 2020 when it expires, according to Mother Nature News. We know from past experiences what Disney and its animators can do, but the drone technology behind the aerial display is fantastic. The little drones only weigh a little over half-a-pound and are about a foot long and wide. The LED light display they carry is able to create over four billion color combinations. Walden says the drones will do anything they tell them, and Intel has created an entire platform to create aerial displays. “The way that they work is that they wirelessly talk with the computer. The drones don’t actually communicate with each other," he says. “You program them upfront for the light show itself, and then the drones essentially are independent.” Walden also says the drones aren't assigned a specific role in the light show. It is only after the computer goes through a number of algorithms, such as GPS signal and battery level on each drone that the drone is assigned a specific part. Then, all the operator has to do is push a button.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 19, 2016 at 11:00AM In a prior column, I reported that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) upcoming Coffee Lake family of processors would be based on the company's upcoming Cannon Lake architecture, based on information found on Intel's website.  However, instead of being built in Intel's upcoming 10-nanometer manufacturing technology as the proper Cannon Lake products will be, the Coffee Lake parts are expected to be built using some derivative of the 14-nanometer technology first introduced in the second half of 2014. Image source: Intel.  However, a new rumor from a user on the AnandTech forums suggests that at least part of this is not correct. Let's take a closer look. Coffee Lake may be based on Kaby Lake architecture According to user Borealis7 on the AnandTech forums, Coffee Lake for desktops will include six processor cores, use Intel's Kaby Lake architecture, and arrive in 2018. The bits about core count and launch date were already previously leaked, but the information about its being based on the Kaby Lake architecture is new. Indeed, the information Intel had inadvertently made public on its website suggested that Coffee Lake was referred to internally as Cannon Lake, implying that it would include updated processor cores and graphics. If the information from Borealis7 is correct, then it would seem that Coffee Lake for desktops is essentially Kaby Lake, but with up to six processor cores rather than up to four, from an architectural perspective. More cores and better 14-nanometer tech to do the trick? Assuming Borealis7's information is good, then it means that for desktops as well as high-performance notebooks, Intel will essentially have used the same basic Skylake processor and graphics architecture that first debuted in the fall of 2015 for three full product generations. Remember: Kaby Lake used the Skylake architecture, with the performance gains coming primarily from an enhanced 14-nanometer process technology.  If Borealis7 is right, then Intel seems to be betting that additional cores coupled with a yet-again improved 14-nanometer manufacturing technology (see the following slide) will combine to deliver enough of a performance boost to make the Coffee Lake family worthy of being branded eighth-generation Core. Intel's seventh-generation Core processors are built on 14nm+ tech; the company is planning for additional performance enhancements beyond 14nm+. Image source: Intel. Intel claimed to achieve a 12% improvement in its 14-nanometer+ relative to 14-nanometer, and if it can deliver a manufacturing technology-related boost of at least that much with the 14-nanometer derivative it uses to build Coffee Lake, then this -- coupled with the increased core count -- could make Coffee Lake at least as compelling a product offering, relatively speaking, as Kaby Lake will be in desktop computers.   All eyes on Ice Lake and beyond After Coffee Lake, Intel is likely to bring processors based on its Ice Lake architecture to the desktop personal-computer market. Ice Lake is expected to be a new architecture, so performance per clock should go up significantly from Skylake, Kaby Lake, and Coffee Lake to Ice Lake, whether Coffee Lake uses the Skylake architecture or Cannon Lake architecture. Additionally, Ice Lake will be Intel's second architecture built using its 10-nanometer technology. That means investors should expect that it will use the company's performance-enhanced 10-nanometer+ technology rather than the first-generation 10-nanometer technology. It's good to see that Intel is delivering on its commitment to deliver performance improvements for desktop personal computers each year. Nevertheless, I think that Intel can be more aggressive in bringing new processor architectures to its desktop processor families going forward, accelerating its generation-over-generation performance improvements. Indeed, given Intel's gargantuan research and development budget, which in 2015 topped $12 billion, recycling an architecture for three full generations -- even though Intel is planning to deliver performance improvements with each generation -- doesn't sit right.  We'll see if this is what Intel ultimately does over the next year or so.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The official clip, below, shows 100 drones dancing around to form a spinning Christmas tree. There are other videos abound on YouTube that show a few other elements. Or better yet, make a trip to Disney Springs to take a watch for yourself. Listening to the show’s announcement it appears this is just the beginning in this relationship. I’m sure the creative minds at Intel and Disney Imagineers will deliver an even more impressive show down the road. Drones are magic The idea itself isn’t crazy to comprehend, each drone acts as a pixel. However, gathering all the data, accounting for weather conditions, making 100 drones move in concert with each other, while spinning and lighting up is more complex than you playing around with a drone. That’s a lot of math and, in the end, a really cool result.

Intel is laying off a major portion of its wearables group TechCrunch 1 day ago Brian Heater © AP In this Jan. 12, 2011, file photo, the Intel logo is displayed on the exterior of Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, California. According to sources close to the company, Intel is about to step back from wearables in a big way. In 2014, the company purchased Basis, a little known producer of some truly excellent fitness watches. The acquisition was clearly a piece of a much larger puzzle for Intel, as it folded the brand into NDG – the New Devices Group – a new wing designed to make a big play for the booming wearables market, while hitting back against rival chipmaker, Qualcomm. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▼ 34.95 -0.07 -0.20% Qualcomm Inc QCOM ▲ 67.31 +0.64 +0.96% In June 2015, Intel picked up Recon, makers of wearable heads-up displays for cyclists, snowboarders and the like. Here’s what Recon co-founder, Dan Eisenhardt had to say at the time. Intel is an ideal partner for Recon. Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, made his commitment to wearable technology very clear shortly after assuming his current role in 2013. He reaffirmed that commitment in his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show this January. Brian and his team, including New Technology Group head Josh Walden, share our vision for the potential of smart eyewear in the consumer and enterprise markets, and this deal reflects that shared vision. This summer, however, cracks began to show in the company’s wearable plans. In June, Intel recalled Basis Peak devices due to overheating concerns – effecting, according to the company, roughly 0.2-percent of users. Rather than replacing the units, the company simply stopped sales of the device altogether. Intel took a step further and shut down the Peak’s software support (including cloud storage), effective by year’s end. © Provided by TechCrunch It was clear at the time that this would prove a big setback for Intel’s wearable dreams. After all, the Basis acquisition hadn’t produced much for the company beyond the release of the Titanium, a snazzed up version of the Peak that looked a bit better with a business suit. Now, according to sources close to the company, Intel is planning to take a major step back from its investment in the space – or possibly even exit wearables altogether. The changes will include a large number of layoffs in NDG, along with the larger New Technologies Group into which it was folded back in April of last year – a move already viewed at the time by some as an early sign of Intel’s displeasure with its wearables division. The company has already informed a number of employees about the changes, with many expected to lose their jobs before year’s end. Reports thus far have been varied, but all point to a large job loss for those in the NDG and the possible shut down of the group altogether. © Provided by TechCrunch Along with the layoffs, the move likely means that much NDG’s work will never see the light of day, including Basis Ruby, an unannounced fitness watch, which, at the very least, might have helped buoy the company following the unceremonious death of the Peak.

By Michael Kassner | November 19, 2016, 6:07 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/michaeljung Electronic health records (EHR) theft is the new "low-hanging fruit," meaning the bad guys are having a field day stealing EHR databases. For example, Zack Whittaker in a June 2016 ZDNet post writes, "A hacker who claims to have obtained more than ten million health records is selling the data to the highest bidder on the dark web." However, several experts, including Francois Paget, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani of Intel Security, noticed something while they were compiling data for their 2015 paper The Hidden Data Economy (PDF): No one knows what's being done with the stolen EHR data dumps. McFarland and Samani, along with researcher Christiaan Beek, decided to see if they could find what's happening to the stolen EHR databases. Less than a year later, the Intel researchers published Health Warning: Cyberattacks are targeting the health care industry (PDF), providing information on how EHR databases are being stolen, how they are sold, and offering some ideas on how the EHR data dumps are being used. More about IT Security The 20 biggest tech disasters of all time Interview with a hacker: S1ege from Ghost Squad Hackers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter Before getting to the paper's findings, Beek, McFarland, and Samani offer a disclaimer. "We must make one thing clear: It is not our intention to stir up fear," write the authors. "Rather, our aim is to document the threat landscape so that healthcare organizations can take action." As to why fear comes into play, the researchers mention that records of a person's health simply cannot be changed in a fashion similar to canceling stolen credit/debit cards. "Indeed, the nonperishable nature of medical records makes them particularly valuable," mention Beek, McFarland, and Samani. "Because the ability to reduce the impact of a medical data breach is significantly diminished, we must do all we can to reduce the likelihood of successful attacks." SEE: Identity Theft Protection Policy (Tech Pro Research) Cybercrime-as-a-service As with other cybercrimes, stealing EHR databases no longer requires technical proficiency. The researchers offered evidence that vulnerabilities are actively being sold, and "compromise-as-a-service" is a thriving business. The researchers write, "To put this in perspective, a relatively nontechnically-proficient cyber thief buys tools to exploit a vulnerable organization, uses them with a little free technical support, and then extracts 1,000 records that could net him about 15,564 dollars." If that's still too complicated for would-be criminals, the researchers add, "Rather than 'buying the RDP,' the attacker could simply have acquired an active account belonging to a health care organization." SEE: Electronic health records: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) Are EHRs really for sale? Next, the research team verified that EHRs were, in fact, for sale. Beek, McFarland, and Samani write, "Quickly, we discovered dark web vendors offering for sale huge data dumps of stolen medical data. In some instances, its availability was highly publicized." Figure A is one seller's website offering a database containing almost 400,000 EHRs. The database includes names, addresses, and data about the patient's health care provider. Figure A Image: Intel Security, Christiaan Beek, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani Hiding in plain sight It is apparent that cybercriminals are not timid. Sellers are unafraid to advertise stolen EHR databases on social-media outlets, as shown in the tweet by TheDarkOverlord in Figure B. Figure B Image: Intel Security, Christiaan Beek, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani Twitter has removed the above tweet, but it is a digital "whack-a-mole" game as sellers quickly open new accounts using different credentials or advertising a different EHR data dump. But is anyone buying? It is clear records are being stolen and offered throughout the Dark Web, but is anyone buying, and if so how are the records being used? Regarding data-dump purchases, the researchers offer as proof review websites, similar to the one shown in Figure C, that rate sellers of stolen data. Figure C Image: Intel Security, Christiaan Beek, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani "The seller appears to be active, with 100% positive feedback from 15 interactions to date," note Beek, McFarland, and Samani. "These positive reviews were likely gained as a seller, as the recent feedback clearly indicates." SEE: Gallery: The top 10 Dark Web search engines (TechRepublic) A troublesome issue Even after all their research, Beek, McFarland, and Samani are troubled by the lack of evidence regarding the motivation of the cybercriminals buying EHRs. "With payment card information we have documented that stolen card numbers are used to conduct fraud against the victims," write the researchers. "At present, however, we have not identified specific uses for bulk data purchases of medical data." The research team members vow to continue looking into the theft of EHRs, saying it deserves significant attention. If their track record is any indication, there should be no doubt that the trio will eventually find what buyers of stolen EHR databases intend to do with their purchases.

The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' Lara O'Reilly Nov. 20, 2016, 4:09 AM 7,495 facebook linkedin twitter email print McDonald's For some brands, an audio logo is just as important as a visual one. Close your eyes, and you'll know it's an Intel ad from its famous chimes. "I'm Lovin' It" is synonymous with McDonald's. And we all know what the "Green Giant" sings. But which brands have the best-performing sound marks? Scroll down to find which brand jingles stand out from the rest amongst consumers in the US. Methodology Veritonic, a marketing analytics platform for commercial music, surveyed more than 2,600 panelists in October 2016 and asked them to listen to audio logos selected from Interbrand's Best Global Brands ranking, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&P. Panelists were asked to record their emotions as the logos played and were asked about the feelings the audio evoked. They were then contacted 48 hours later to test recall of audio logos. Panelists' emotions and engagement were also tracked using Veritonic's patent-pending EchoTime technology. Each brand's overall 1-100 score in the ranking combines unaided recall, plus emotion categories including: Excited, happy, approachable, authentic, confident, empowering, innovative, likable, reputable, simple, trustworthy, and unique. View As: One Page Slides 10. T-Mobile. Overall score: 77.4. Unaided recall: 82 T-Mobile's chimes scored well for evoking happy and excited emotions. It doesn't do so well on the unaided recall front, but the mark is distinctive for people who have heard it before — giving it a high engagement score.   9. Statefarm. Overall score: 78.9. Unaided recall: 84 The insurer's beepy audio logo places scored well for "happy" (84), "excited" (74) and "simple" (72). It placed in ninth place for unaided recall, but didn't score well on the engagement metric. 8. Folgers. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 86 The Folgers jingle — "The best part of waking up, is Folgers in your cup" — is more than 30-years-old, having first launched in 1984. It scored well for emotions including "happy" (82), "reputable" (78), "approachable" (78), and "authentic" (78) — all the types of feelings a coffee company would be hoping to evoke from listeners. Folgers was tied in third position for unaided recall. 7. Chevy. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 88 Chevy's whistled audio mark is unusual as, unlike many other brands, it sometimes plays at the start of an ad rather than the end (although it plays at the end of the video above). The logo scores well in the "authentic" (78), "confident" (78), "approachable" (76), "trustworthy" (76) and "reputable" categories. However, it underperformed in the "excited" attribute, scoring just 68. 6. McDonald's. Overall score: 79.6. Unaided recall: 85 "I'm Lovin' It" launched globally in 2003, sung by Justin Timberlake, and it has been McDonald's ad jingle ever since. The logo scores 84 for "excited" and "82" for happy. It tied third for unaided recall. 5. Hot Pockets. Overall score: 80.5. Unaided recall: 85 Famous for the memorable microwave "ding," the sung Hot Pockets audio mark scored well for unaided recall. It was also a top performer in the "happy" (86) and "excited" (76) categories.   4. Green Giant. Overall score: 80.8. Unaided recall: 86 "Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant" has been in-market since the 1960s, giving the logo a strong unaided recall score. It scored well for "happy" (86) and "authentic" (78), however, the jingle only scored around average on "excited" (76) and lagged behind the other top scorers in terms of engagement. 3. Intel. Overall score: 82.7. Unaided recall: 88 Probably the most famous audio logo of the bunch, the Intel chimes are internationally recognized, earning them an unaided recall score of 88. Intel ties first for evoking a feeling of "innovation" (70) amongst listeners. It was also near the top of the pile on "excited" (80) and in the overall engagement metrics. 2. Farmer's Insurance. Overall score: 83.2. Unaided recall: 88 "We are Farmers! Bum ba dum bum bum bum bum." The Farmer's Insurance audio mark is a relative newcomer in this top 10, as far as on-air promotion is concerned. It's a top performer in several of the emotion scores including "trustworthiness" (74), "uniqueness" (74) and was joint top on "innovative" (70) and "empowering" (74). 1. Nationwide. Overall score: 87.2. Unaided recall: 92 Nationwide's "Nationwide is on your side" jingle has been on air for more than 50 years and is still as relevant today as it ever was, according to this study. The audio logo demonstrably leads the pack when it comes to unaided recall and was in the top decile of performers for engagement. It also scored big on "happy" (84), "excited" (76), and "simple" (74). "The speed and pattern of the responses by panelists to the audio logo demonstrates how deeply planted the audio logo has become in panelists' psyches," Veritonic writes in the report.  More: Audio Logo Features facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' For some brands, an audio logo is just as...

It seem Intel is waking up to that fact, as new reports indicate the company is laying off almost all the staff from its wearable division. This also comes after the debacle surrounding Intel’s own Basis Peak smartwatch, which was recalled earlier this year over concerns of overheating and burning users. Speaking to TechCrunch, sources close to Intel have said it is planning a large number of lay offs from its New Devices Group (NDG), followed by an overall backing away from the wearables market. “Reports thus far have been varied, but all point to a large job loss for those in the NDG and the possible shut down of the group altogether,” the outlet wrote. Also published was a photo of an unannounced wearable called the Basis Ruby, a smartwatch with heart-rate, activity, and sleep tracking features, but which appears to have been cancelled in the wake of discontinuing the Basis Peak after its recall. It’s not clear how many lay offs Intel’s NDG will see or when it will become official, however TechCrunch‘s sources say it will take place before the year’s end. The NDG was already folded into Intel’s New Technologies Group back in April, so an entire closure of the NDG could lead to wider restructuring within the division.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version November 19, 2016 - 15:16 AMT SHARE Intel backing away from wearables, reports suggest When Intel bought Basis back in 2014, there were hopes the acquisition would push the wearables firm to the next level. Sadly, things didn't go that way -- the company's first Intel-backed product had a tendency to catch fire, and was subsequently pulled from the market earlier this year. Now, any hope for a bounce back has been all but extinguished: as Engadget reports citing a report from TechCrunch, Intel's wearable division is facing massive layoffs. According to TechCrunch, sources close to the company say that Intel is planning to back away from the wearable space -- and will soon lay off staff in its New Devices Group. In addition to the layoff report, TechCrunch also managed to get a few pictures of the Basis Ruby, an unannounced fitness wearable that will now never see the light of day. The Ruby's product box shows a compact watch with sleep tracking and heart rate monitor features with some basic smartwatch functionality -- a Basis Peak in a smaller form. The Ruby was also set to usher in a new version of the Basis software. There's no word yet if that update is still coming for users of older products, Engadget said. SHARE PanARMENIAN.Net © 2000—2016

Now a report claims that Apple may have intentionally throttled the former variant so that it was on-par with the latter. According to Bloomberg, researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights evaluated the Qualcomm-powered Verizon and Intel-carrying AT&T versions of the iPhone 7. The firms found that the two were mostly equal in terms of speed even though the former is technically able to download data faster. This leads us to the theory of the hour, which is that Apple isn’t taking full advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities. The X12 Qualcomm modem found inside the carrier’s iPhone 7 model is capable of pushing up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T Intel one boasts of a lower 450Mbps. Also See: iPhone 7 severely burns pregnant woman’s arm If the throttling allegations prove true, it would be a highly unusual step for Apple to take since companies usually aim to have the fastest phones. Analysts think the brand may have done this so that everyone has a uniform iPhone 7 experience. This conclusion is backed by insider sources who told Recode that Apple wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having multiple suppliers for its chips, while also wanting the two models to be as similar as possible. The latter may have been done to avoid making AT&T and T-Mobile angry. This makes sense, since it would be unfair for Verizon customers to have better speeds. However, the apparent throttling may still make many consumers angry given that their iPhone 7 is possibly not living up to its full potential. To make matters worse, Twin Prime pitted the iPhone 7 against the Samsung Galaxy S7 and found that the second was two times faster than the first. Both were utilizing Qualcomm’s X12 modem and run on Verizon’s network.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM The market for augmented reality apps and devices, which superimpose digital objects over real world ones, could grow from practically nothing today to $90 billion by 2020, according to tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital. After early blunders like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Glass, the AR market recently gained mainstream momentum with the popularity of Niantic's Pokemon Go -- which prompted many investors to seek out AR-related stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Most "pure play" AR companies are start-ups instead of publicly traded companies. However, there are still a few ways that investors can gain valuable exposure to the AR market via bigger tech companies. Let's examine four such companies -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Google, and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM). Microsoft Microsoft's HoloLens can project 3D Minecraft on table tops, project interactive holograms of 3D designs for graphic and industrial designers, and even "teleport" another person's full-body hologram into your room. Several major partners, including Lowe's and Volvo, already use HoloLens to showcase their products in augmented reality. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's upcoming Windows 10 Creator Update will add 3D image capture and editing tools to the OS, which will enable artists and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in HoloLens and its upcoming VR headsets. Microsoft claims that the tools will be so user-friendly that 12-year-olds can create their own holograms. However, the developer version of HoloLens still costs $3,000 -- indicating that it won't become a mainstream gadget anytime soon. Intel Intel's major play on AR is Project Alloy, a reference design for AR headsets similar to the HoloLens. The device is powered by Intel's sixth generation Core processor and its RealSense depth-sensing cameras. Unlike HoloLens, Project Alloy doesn't need to be tethered to a PC. By offering this reference design to OEMs that want to quickly release AR headsets, Intel could widen its moat against challengers like Qualcomm. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. Intel is also investing heavily in the computer vision technologies, which AR apps, drones, and autonomous cars need to "see" obstacles. It acquired computer vision companies Itseez and Movidius over the past year, which could enhance the ability of its RealSense cameras to identify objects and surfaces. Google Google has noticed the game-changing potential of Intel's RealSense cameras in the AR market. Earlier this year, it partnered with Intel to develop Project Tango, a platform which enables smartphones and tablets to identify real-world objects with the RealSense camera and project AR overlays on them. For example, a user looking through a Project Tango display could change the walls and floors of a real room, or put virtual masks and costumes on nearby people. We haven't heard much about Project Tango since then, but many industry watchers have suggested that the project could be merged with its new VR platform Daydream. Google has also invested heavily in Magic Leap, an AR start-up which is reportedly developing a mixed reality headset akin to the HoloLens. It's still unclear how all these pieces will come together, but Google will likely adopt a more cautious strategy after Glass flopped due to its awkward appearance, pricing issues, and privacy concerns. STMicroelectronics STMicroelectronics manufactures a wide variety of chips for connected cars, wearables, and Internet of Things gadgets. It also makes motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) for smartphones and tablets. STMicro lost ground in motion sensors to its smaller rival InvenSense over the past few years, but it recently launched an ultra-low power 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer combo device designed specifically for VR and AR devices. The device has already been certified for use with both the Project Tango and Daydream platforms. As the AR and VR markets grow, rising demand for more motion sensors should enable STMicro to leverage its scale and offer its sensors at lower prices than InvenSense. STMicro is also heavily invested in the computer vision market -- it manufactures ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) leader Mobileye's EyeQ computer vision chips, and produces LIDAR technologies for autonomous driving, AR, and VR uses with Microvision. The key takeaways Microsoft, Intel, Google, and STMicro all represent interesting ways to gain exposure to the AR market, but investors should note that they won't represent major sources of revenue for these companies yet. But if the market takes off over the next few years, all four companies could reap some big rewards. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

Apple Purposely Throttles Down Some iPhone 7 Data Speeds in the United States GO Verizon's iPhone 7 version should be faster than AT&T's Nov 19, 2016 03:28 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  It's a common fact that Apple uses components from different suppliers with each iPhone the company launches, and this year's model is no exception. For example, in the United States, there are two different versions of the iPhone 7, but they're only different because they embed different components, not because one performs better than the other. Bloomberg reports that Verizon's iPhone 7 is equipped with a Qualcomm X12 modem, while the AT&T/T-Mobile version comes with an Intel XMM 3360. On paper, the Qualcomm X12 modem should perform much faster than the Intel XMM 3360. According to their respective specifications, Qualcomm's latest X12 modem is capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second, while the Intel modem can only reach up to 450 megabits per second. However, in reality, both modems are about the same when it comes to performance. Apparently, Apple has decided to throttle down the Qualcomm X12 modem, as not to upset carriers and customers alike. A field test that put the Galaxy S7 equipped with the Qualcomm X12 and the iPhone 7 with the same modem chip against each other showed that Samsung's smartphone was twice as fast on the same network. iPhone 7 Basically, we now have two iPhone 7 versions that perform the same, but one of them could be faster than the other if Apple enabled the full power of the Qualcomm X12 modem. Obviously, that's not going to happen since the Cupertino-based company has no intention of angering either AT&T or T-Mobile, as well as their customers in the United States, by making one of the iPhone 7 variants weaker than Verizon's model. Currently, there's a small performance difference between the Verizon iPhone 7 and those from AT&T and T-Mobile (in favor of the former), but it's almost negligible. Apple refused to comment on the matter, though a spokeswoman did state that “every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing.”   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple iPhone#iPhone 7 modem#Qualcomm X12#Intel XMM 3360#iPhone 7 Plus subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news More Android Users Switching to iOS Thanks to iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Adapters Start Tearing After Only One Month Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Could Be in the Works Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus Ships in November, but Only If You Order Now Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked Kapustkiy Breaks into Indian Regional Council Server, 17,000 Users Exposed Microsoft Launches Windows Defender Hub for Windows 10 Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked 2 photos    iPhone 7 Plus & iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments iPhone 8 to Come with Significant Dual-Camera Upgrades more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The device has already been certified for use with both the Project Tango and Daydream platforms. As the AR and VR markets grow, rising demand for more motion sensors should enable STMicro to leverage its scale and offer its sensors at lower prices than InvenSense. STMicro is also heavily invested in the computer vision market -- it manufactures ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) leader Mobileye's EyeQ computer vision chips, and produces LIDAR technologies for autonomous driving, AR, and VR uses with Microvision. The key takeaways Microsoft, Intel, Google, and STMicro all represent interesting ways to gain exposure to the AR market, but investors should note that they won't represent major sources of revenue for these companies yet. But if the market takes off over the next few years, all four companies could reap some big rewards. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

That’s where Intel and the Cambridge-based Broad Institute are hoping to step in. They are teaming up in the hopes of making it easier for researchers, companies and academics to tap into the wealth of genomic information through a new $25 million effort, according to an announcement issued last week. “What we’re really trying to do is lower the barriers for people like that, so they can use genome sequencing in care of patients,” said Anthony Philippakis, chief data officer at the Broad Institute, which is a joint collaboration between MIT and Harvard. “They’re incredibly good at making the tools computationally efficient, and we like to think we’re able to develop very accurate and scientifically useful tools,” he said. “This brings together a combination of engineering and genomic science for the advancement of medicine.” Since 2001, the cost to sequence a person’s genome has plummeted from nearly $100 million to roughly $1,000. The time it takes has also fallen sharply, from years to mere hours. Because of that, the amount of genomic information doubles every eight months, the companies said, and efforts to deal with all that data have struggled to keep up. “What we want to do is make it easier, faster to drive analytics for genome sequencing,” said Kay Eron, GM of Intel’s health and life sciences division. “This is a really important piece that will drive health care.” Easier access to the genomes of people from around the world would allow a doctor treating a cancer patient to compare their patient’s genetic qualities with others with the same profile in the hopes of seeing what drugs and treatments did or didn’t work. The companies hope to develop a set of tools that will allow researchers to easily share and track the genomic sequences they’ve collected. They’re also looking to create easy-to-use software that will analyze genomic sequences.

Some some decent Tennessee's when. We forgot its coverage because for the most part they are anywhere from else. Pluck bush out yet. Good defensive effort to road he's going. Tuukka Rask who dropped this bomb on a life yes and covers that was really highlight the game Thursday night. Most exciting action of the night David. In letter admiral and a tie Anderson in four Ryan Whitney of former NHL or will be on the show at some point it brought us Pletcher. Play went through Scott particulates podcast with them in the arsenal is like the even. For you guys this week he was on some connection with a ushering in a. I think am I think he was deep put like O'Neill will follow up and then there was some countries' refusal to accept some some I think there's some like that don't mind. I don't know of these in in that deportation Cortes a lot. Stability is stars such as well so yeah right as we have our vision Ozzie candidates and until they don't wanna they don't want allowed back on the country they wanna keep them there on their networks 24 hours a day with his. Sardonic size sides. And not cheap for the charming extant. Our net or NHL looked player taste still LB Lyndon byers gonna Joe's gonna top the hour to add some expertise this discussion views Koppen and another garden for a early in Winnipeg socking a lot about why the offense is now for the Bruins the how involved the trade possibility should they be coming up but we are discussing to go but you're right it is really not mean they can't be considering trading Rask. At this point crate she till I do think it's it's a possibility so the textures bring up Ryan Spooner who is a possibility to move on. And crate G I guess they dangle in the offseason right now you review hubris. Yes face an Intel that yeah they've they've they tried it. They've they've through his name out there but. Mike has said that the values too low and coming off hip surgery knows that I take that in the years into this to me years left his no trade and he's waiting in the first place. But I just think that there's a lot of things working against a creature E*Trade last year for a number of reasons from both the Bruins standpoint and the you know potential buyers standpoint so he's a bad players are not average second line center at this point right when you said. Spooner a great real quick. I mean he's healthy baby Obama I mean look at a guy he was I mean I thought it a couple years really was a top line definitely a number ones and I hey I know since you know the last couple years Bergeron is kind of usurp that number one line title for them in this town. I'm yeah I would definitely Kama top six its formal tops export Devlin a look to senate. That has been about great GM and end it. My only reluctance in just kind of sell low won him a solid sound at all as. Here's a playoff supply and twenty elevenths when he thirteen an old eleven was a while Google but he led them. The whole league and scored both the bullish both of those years when he did he need Portland which each to do. Is the question would would he beat it back in the playoffs Spiller. Is going to be seeing. I sent my doubts lobbying that's as humans born is going to be on his one complain actual arm which that's sulphide battle line remains to be seen. But at what point penis is Reza may have playoff performances is pretty good. And I think you know I mean god given the benefit of the belt that he's capable of doing that again on this personalities are had a hip surgery. So. You know I mean if it again if there's a deal it's always what you gonna get back that's that's a key in any trade mean you know you don't wanna just trading guy because wanted to trade him. But I think that that's some they'd have to spend a lot out of bottoming because he was I mean he's one of those guys he raises level and when the games are brought there and I know each heats. This sometimes play his play is almost a little full of full item about a word. I he he's not you know the most I engaging fellow at times he's not a dynamic personality Ed by any stretch. And I think that meet meet meet people like. Easy for them to get rid of him because he's not you know this kind of funny guy nearly QE I mean. Think about no one really knows much about daily creature in the Stoppard has been there as long as he has Armenia's European he's not an American guy so. You know he's just I kind of kept to himself and that's fine that's you know show his prerogative but. I I think that people feel like they also don't I don't think the fans have that that much of an of an emotional attachment with the meant to do with other guys. Maybe not maybe the organization doesn't either I don't know that I mean I could see Bacchus at some point in the second senator creature move on for some package of players maybe not this year but. Next for the year after that it could actually I mean if they decided. You know that better serves haven't haven't acts as the number two senate. I like Backus person I like them on the wing I think you know with with him. Especially with our over the set up man like crate G I mean that's kind of an ideal setup man forms for if they had notes that the plot 2530 goals. It's are closest connection to court and exactly he had of that kind of big haul that window which which needs of honor treat fox farm rights to do that got me pretty but he can do. Exactly exactly so I I think I think those 20. You know and in another maybe month or so wanna get a little bit what chemistry I think they'll be fine but. You know you don't wanna just treating guy for the sake of trade immigrate crate G again I I loved what he did the playoffs those those two years he was he was a monster man. I think he still has an and in him again. Saturday's game heroes which rated the media abruptly ETT it's the market falls ago Stephen Boston's building on policy are you. They didn't. Wear a duty to radiate out accurately. Also is set ticket TV. All of our licensee. Yale Harvard finished. Now that but now I can't watch college football or product again. What's underneath lipid and to Sweetwater goggle goaltender harbored. It accurately to crack. You know. Of the block. I once seen as a doctor. I wanna see residential area. I can't. You know I'm gold. I can't remember as a goaltender. Much you are. But I actually call. The only slip. Are you looking colts and at Caltech for a while it is. Aren't these games can. Scoring chances. Nobody school. Connecticut tumbling army generally seen. No no. Almost all put all those stages on his face you know I was diversity. Of practice to you know that. I did didn't know that even up frosty forest thought. We'll outfield steals former trainer for the old ruins the 772 Bruins won't let me rest one of those and Tom. It's part is what you blame that for the price tag as you make it seven million a year we got into that discussion I Xavier thinking about making a blockbuster trade. You gotta give something to get something that would be a commodity something like you said Dallas would want. Nearly been looking for a marquee goaltender you get seven million off the books and bang you're gonna add some offensive or or or tell the Blue Line. But the Odyssey did listings with closed system their bill or rats so much that stuff. Now you know if you Eds Zain. MacIntyre in waiting in the wings and he was saying like what Martin Jones analysts are for you know for the kings a year or two ago in addition to trademark jet -- well let us and you know it's ice ice is funny said that Miley got no one know once of the trade him back down and of course on one person on would have pulled out there tweets from when the Bruins actually had my Jones at three days not a light scented. I saw him by do you you'd you be viewed and you said you're the one you're in the Internet data you'll with a one person said that deterrent to trade a rat's butt. Again you know you'd trade a number one goalie you better have somebody like who can do the job. It waiting in the wings right now MacIntyre. I don't know that he's that I have a prospect I think EC on eagle rock yet if he certainly better than to shoot man right now but. You know idea if he looks a lot better right so annoying Niemi back for a year yeah any calling berg. Make it in that Al Mahdi Abbott's damn console like that was why your yes. I don't know I don't I naught I don't. It but why bring the hey why even bring in the white gonna downgrade your most important position that Israel I pray fifty out of here. You get upgrade everything else let let's go globe put deep but what's cents a don't know if you get a crappy eagle tell you missed the playoffs figures are over here. Absolutely and I listen three as an arrow are you sure. If with him trade him to or ask for anti Niemi here you muzzled his cell everybody at that point I mean. You know you meet number one goalie Matt bask in it resent Rask is if some want the Kabul that paid which he's not he's paid. You know with perfect v.'s biggest market value of not underpaid right now out this year. They're easily overpaid because the Bruins allowed to because they. You know they will haggle back and what they could sign of the decent money and they they gave him a contract yet they singular sign a one year deal which in effect. Was a contract in any when he played his ass off and and they had a payment that the money makes outsold the fact these particular as money is. Really the draw is fault of the in the first place they should've recognized would anybody watch hockey recognized back and Tuukka Rask does that ease the real deal I like him enough IR EF 525 million mobile whatever it was asked vote wasn't crazy money. And the only non all we wanna see what little blunt he showed it to the man now that's lays make all the money's main house I think they got the wrong they get themselves. The blame for his contract if a hard rebuilt comes Charley moved before to grasp and moved and sold it nearly as much. None of course not but it but that's that would be the first sign of them tearing it down and starting hollering and I'd be a charge trade than a restaurant. I LBS and a serious hockey smarts this conversation in May tropical as well Lyndon byers WA AF joint deceit setters gay killer rear admiral it's I Anderson but you my AT&T it's our markets which rated B yeah. Rear admiral for Clark school sports and I'm like yeah sure. Hosted by Jim Blair from the curtain Callahan for Saturday's games he's brought to you by AT&T and star market need is great. Got a lot of losses. Thanks so much for some bees talk right now on Sports Radio don't you. Against all odds back for a second straight weekend Laird in the general here on Saturdays gate next week for the Bruins admiral picks week. Good and bad to be at this week to get into that coming up with a cast of thousands four to six points on the road trip for Boston since we last spoke it wants seven out of ten. Big picture that one of the hotter teams in the NHL built with that stretch. It'll Steven Stamkos for four months that's good news if you're a Boston fan and at 40% of the season on Bruins are definitely in the race bad news is. Get shut out Minnesota gets really the only good team they played over this three games been Amaral and just scoring is down. Second brutal loss of a point in the last one minute and some change I you feel about this as the Bruins seem right now. Killer tables get the speed admirals that like the public that number five eligible Craig. Feel like it is a deal if I'd gotten to have back on my way things normally go to. Yeah I was you know other a top fence of the trip it was a quick three game trip kind of an odd you know what you know Arizona outside. I've Minnesota Colorado distance kind of an unusual trip as far as the travel by. Yeah I was a bomber and ending and that's like that's like while I headlines had an impossible as Qichen and adds that she's euthanized when I wrote. You know it's just a tough loss died yet the play good I mean it it wasn't really an offensive game Minnesota like that it was talking about the doubles cup weeks of them a month chart was here or another location but. Just basically how the organization we have been a boring team to watch even though they've. They've moved on from certain GMs and certain coaches don't play that style and they brought in in a lot of stars guys who can score but they. This just sucked sucked that a bolt Minnesota Wild it just doesn't really appealed Junius was it's likely that you'll that right nineties great and in its cycle but I don't see why they'd. With a new coach brought in with new. What is truly supposed to be offensive why they always kind of played and it just every time you put a wild game even if the plane a pro is just not really gaining huge OpenId seed natural we saw the other night that. Was very defense about the Bruins are playing a good road game I mean they you know and didn't you lovable (%expletive) Nineteen minutes and live a sixteen seconds or whatever it was. I'm in which is what the bounces a means to me that was one of those like. Allows frustrate me had a goal called back on on a replay which yell like tonight out of the new wage Allen and have announced that instant replay. But it was just one those things I mean it. What's it Michael Grammy goes to make Nassau surpassing its share and close by to cry it's just like us you know 882 games it's gonna happen me happened while. Didn't lose off which I deflection but Montreal same thing it's. You know you play it play about off fought for the whole game and then you get a bad bounce I think of it and of course 82 games it all comes out in the wash. All the Montreal game was. To be a backup goaltender at a bad moment at the end this would rewind the tape just before the goal. Riley Nash is in their for posture and act as he's injured right top line can't get it out of zone and didn't. And seconds ago in any compounds that by. Jacket guy into the back of Adam Kuwaiti ego the Seattle tumbled. Head over in over heels in the crease then McQueen gets back up but he said puck goes off Sheehan and instill well the warships of weeks earlier from Riley Nash in that spot. Yet it was but made it out he was the stop before that mean you're the play itself was one of those bouts but right before him a Quaid. Good cream to say you know like I it I loved the fans on its way to. One of those is welcome at all notre embattled agency that got him aquarium like Aaron did you see 'cause he Nash buried commencement where it raises. He can't call what are not the other right. And now ices you know would McQuay was slow get not been in of people wonder what it was that was sliced as well bought a raps that's a tournament is an offensive opportunity. They typically don't blow the whistle especially in that situation. So it was not the guy kind of precursor to the actual goal itself but. You know if if not a pass goes you don't throw his legs are it's television cattle whatever and you know they got a point and we talk about how successful the report solid it's you know I like a cliche that it's a game I brought games of inches all sports I guess but. That's just you know another example why hockey. You know every little inch every little bounced and has so much. Here's the thing with a bruised right now to meet her there ahead of where I thought they would be put at the same time you watch them without Pasternak scoring now 23 in the lake. In average goals per game 2.3 five goals per game and in this stretch didn't help and as you say Minnesota's oldest defense teams and leagues you'll overreact to one game. But right now they're they're profiling is one good line which in a funk. And the rest. They're trying to figure it out. And crate she is still some signs of life he's coming off the injury actually he had a goal on the strip but. You're just not get Netflix it would posture necks out. Trickle down effect now you get Dominic abortion third wants it or not you gotta pump Riley Nash at the top line TB case it's normal roster beyond. Beyond anybody's. Belief and has no points to fifteen games so you got a bunch of plumbers here who were just not getting the job done and I think. In the end they're gonna come down to a fundamental question here. Are they gonna go at the trade deadline or sooner than the trade market to try to again add some pieces somewhere. To get over the hump to get into the playoffs this year like they did last year or even in a bigger blockbuster order they take the big picture and say hey. We're in every bit familiar more than anything. I know we got Corvel we gotta we gotta play along game and I think you've seen enough from some your stars like grass that you gotta be tested it to make a blockbuster trade in yet another piece in need help. These gets yeah I think enough when the market does. It's kind of warm up to see you very seldom see trades before the well before the deadline mean. Last year if it was last year everything kind of went to had a cup after awhile. They are down you Hanson set Joseph straight I was a monster trade that's very rare to have a pure hockey trade like that play a player. Golf one team to one other shall I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon with with the Bruins but yeah I think when the deadline approaches. Even hatchery by the way it was after January early Sebelius in Okie I was fairly well you know that the basically my point is that before the deadline is there's not a lot of trades you'll be you might get a that was our main in my league I mean in my early trade the other day. I think involve an Edmonton it was 22 guys and you know assure prospect night you would need and don't know anyone until this. There's really not a lot of trades are and the the first down the of the season. I think the Bruins I mean provided in assuming they going to be in the thick of things and an Aussie I know reasons that they did not mean. You take a look at if the Eastern Conference and it's insane how close to the area. I mean you know right now Columbus is eight seed with twenty points in. Just below them you have you know Carolina is. Carolina Detroit Florida Philadelphia Toronto Boston all within four points of the play of the last playoff spot. So you know the Bruins I I think they're going to be a late in. The other gonna take a long look at what they have and I'm sure they always kind of adds up and I mean they never really gold up that the blockbuster rude and Thomas Campbell it was. We probably allow as quote unquote big game that they brought in in you know I mean. It's it's kind of an audit of not an odd Naimi get odd reactions to people like roll their eyes Ameen. I think what you see on the cup team he that I mean I think people forget that he actually you know was pretty good and at the Stanley copy wasn't you know he wasn't a step final. He he's he did take a lot of adjust the teeny wasn't as great as everybody. And hope because you heard about the so long come and yet. But I mean I thought I had time a couple of concrete that has little late I thought he played pretty good in the Stanley Cup but. That's me the ability I think get so they'll definitely make some sort of trade whether it just. You know shorn of defense in depth look at some veteran help or or going out and trying to get a top six wing of that which would be ideal because you know what you just like you just said they're not get a lot of Smart right now and and we need to kind of look at the roster even if you drop us an active and that who would so he's gonna be out again tonight by the way. You know it's not an are rocks that jumps audience is these were up what a lot of scorers this shall. You know he mentioned Tyson Tyson Pat Riley Nash get moved up to the arm the first line unimpressed right now. You know I I thought flowed maybe it is that is Jimmy he's been going I think what club might have thrown him up did you sight if not because you know. When you play adequately no matter how like how data you go on how bad you locked and I am on the can be 82 pissed like route ready caught. Ice hockey to help ice like yep up school. I play with two guys one guy at a state a state ring true to each of the state rain what the boss the one's seen him I was terrible skater. And I would left and right that you're gonna get set Abby put two good guys. You got it question it would probably. A year and he was a staff bill and look where he is now he's getting scraps are another team this year I think Washington week. I mean he's he was just a guy who is not gonna get Iraq calmly think. But Jimmy I think they showed a may be thrown out there it's and it looked bad if you can't get a goal at these two guys than them. And they don't know some don't what absolutely but you know now I mean they put Riley Nash still we've we didn't you know decades showed a couple little flashes in and out of of offense but I don't think he's you write that top six like I Arlen at all but I would elect us and you know just maybe get Jimmy don't mean all. Sometimes it just takes one goal and I mean I'm I'm showed confidence is probably is a major issue right arm that's. Such a huge factor in and how these guys go right and sometimes that gets overlooked but. You know no bulls no points no no assist app though I think fifteen games of course it's gonna being had by. I am you know platinum with Tim Shaw or chuck or Alley on a check online at least that's not really gonna put their positions are. To succeed unless he got to you know be ought or the random awed fourth one angle shall. Yeah I I think and I certainly hope that they'd you know when the deadline rolls around some of these unrestricted free agents that you know one on. Teams that on the playoffs yeah I mean obviously we're total with a got to be now but. I abroad are always seem to be an almost guys whether they get who fans want that's a different story but yet the bronze and a really shy at the deadline I would expect them to be Xia. These so last year didn't help when after. John-Michael aisles at least not yet in and hit a gap somewhat on the Nixon of course the disaster in the final game Nazis at the last a drug that not disable 42 foreign on the trade route though. And finally listening to Saturday skate and later rear admiral of hopefully Ryan Whitney joined us on the phone from Toronto with some point here India our oral Tai Anderson and Julius and Lyndon byers LB WA AF gonna sit in for the 4 o'clock hour we brought you by AT&T mobile mobilizing your world. And by star markets he would make to shine. The offense is down the decency you would have expected this to be the other way. Artist won their only defense is sixth right. Why is the offense struggling right now. Half I think it's probably I'll a lack of finish in talent on the on the the top twelve right now on India obviously my shyness is that he does he does Bergeron in the 32 Leo last year. Write its Bora we haven't got a ton out of him yet he obviously played a one cent a last year. But playing on crate she's way he should be you know he should get somewhat but Sony's or he should be able to take advantage of the job too easy gets. Well this roster should be better than last year's Ford. She admitted they were fifteen goals last year. Down traffic and live there there's been a change air list on aliases but late exact that's kind of really interchangeable via. You know what you did take a look olasky hasn't been doing the he's a guide out that that you know you you should count off a twenty goals but. Again I go back to see in the best position to slow play on the third line you know what while Dartmoor it was a senate the other night because of the injury but. I am you know is Riley Nash Demi has been the best set up the map allows you to play it I don't know I don't already as I think. I think bullets you'd better serve on the op plan a great Jim Bacchus I happily played wood but what we are blessed deeply with great she last year. Had some success of them and Boehner back the new third center. Yes I would I would maybe do that right now I mean. I've I just don't people ask each I mean he's very a second third line guy and he's probably not a top line guy. I think eating him up on the on the wing with great Jim backers would be perfect. But you know close clos to mean maybe he'll get to at some point in stickler that by. You know he I got one thing I'm a quote guy I like asparagus coach him but one thing it's always kind of but me is is reluctance to sort of like put guys what do the guys you just kind of goes at the same thing opened some happens and then. You know when they're really the backs are really against the wall that's you know finally make a change but. You know Mike map the last email he just he's kinda had a rotating cast we aren't. You know he's a guy who should have five or six gold by now we get a breakaway in the third period gathers yeah very. Yeah I well I loved I. You know what a goalie comes bombing us 67 gully comes bottomed out yet you know like data Internet and he showed it yet he he had he had his head up he might have shot coming out. Might have been able to make double but. You know that that's the type of situation and you know and not not too many guys or expect and I'm going to come bombing away like that. Pretty scary situation Gary Devin do Mikell like he says that he's about 66 he's a big dude so. Yeah he's got he's got to get going global scheme and it's it's our it's been too long have I think he's got what I want one or two goals by now and he should have more about it but again as he in the best one is he in the best position to succeed right now animal I don't think. Ideas which could be partly injuries and I guess the first question to drop era Saturday skate just plain it's simple wise the offense worse. And why is indeed believe that the 617779797. One obvious place to turn would be. The power play which was pretty good last year yes and for some reason. They're not get it done this year part of that was the terrible start to the year they were what one for thirty niners have been out of the gates. Lately there just like in many chances they had like to a game at best I think the Arizona gated in and have a chance last Saturday itself. I don't know there there are a lot of people have been culled from marsh and get some some cracks in the top power play unit these what are your better scores wise air. So people would like to posture right there when he's healthy course that they'll get that chance that night. What they were successful last year's heart for me to say. Crush him on the power play that can't be everything. Right. AI AI sometimes it's it's not that put a finger on exactly what ails them I don't dislike or just mention confidence or Jimmy Hayes but a lot of times I think. That's such a shoot fact what guys as you know they just they get down selves and in if one guy on a probably when it is not feel on it than in any kind of affect the whole unit in open got a guy whose work on the half wall saint. If he's you know that confidence level lower he's just not feel on how lovers play is not good. You know it's gonna affect the whole unit. I was still is a fight it's a yet this guy's gone bad disguised not doing good. Marchand finally got a lot of power plates camera Hashemi before last year it's easy I he had a ridiculously low number Apollo play in the goals in the first grade because coaches did you isn't and it's just it makes Nazis when he about schools' scores. And it I also has some no punishment full full whatever for Brad be and Brad. Company is it will a lot of the peak in Italy you know bridle Paul let's yeah got a lot of guys that he's you know he's he's in his prime he's done yet paid a lot of me in a lot of guys kill penalties in in on the power play this week. I'm made you know curiously he should be Claudette Jimmy is out there about not picking on Jimmy again but. Just include maybe got maybe that's how close was trying to get Jimmy don't get on a public intimate. An easy one they are relentless gauges put zest in front yeah you won exactly out of fur for the you know that's probably way that's a good point probably puts on because he's 65 he takes up a lot wrong similar to what he does which are all day. Just go block the goalie don't even worry about handle on the park. So yeah does not like just like one the easy answer. As far as the deed that deep down. I keep getting like I mean you're not gonna hear his name of the call looked Calder trophy running at all because of who's in it this year and he's a defenseman who's not rated and quote unquote part Russian defenseman but. I'm impressed every game Brendan Kyle he's just like a means for in a nineteen year old kid 820 I think next week. It's for him to just step in like that the plane with jar on our talk here on NHL team in and really not miss a beat it's it's been incredibly impressive. The watch area press fact he had asked the Nike the hope that that's lamps and when he backed the trade front you get those who swing in. Beyond expectations. And you get to grass green now playing. As good as he's ever bit right and it -- numbers and yes this is part of the best stretch of his career exit atlas clone has changed I don't think that's the case they've been a good offensive team under Julie on the quartet did it with just the style you know he's too conservatively packs in whatever but you look back at colds career he's been a consistently good. Goal scoring team. Except for a couple of years ago two years ago they were bad. But otherwise you know the year they lost much real thirdly Eagles your before that eleventh second before that eight the year they want cups and the score goals. In terms of blaming the system verses. On it other problems that I don't think that's it only gets Julie it's fault. Now they are right now. I think they'll again looking at those that talent here you know you got that. Nash who I think he had even angles at Carolina one year but he's got an offense of the animal. Austin's not as a rookie who. He may turn out to be a top 61 eagle score a couple of years but you know he sees a rookie right now and I'm not an undersized one at that. Sean corral yet another another kid we don't know if he's gonna be a grand aero Marca. Tim shell out he's you know he's not a goal scores see you know you look at the roster and there's not. That's you know half the half full it's who won I'd goal scorers not not everybody's going to be a goal scorer we know that but. You know you're you know he got what part Marchand very dry and Kris she Backus. You know one sport is not blown up bless he's not the not so I think it's a combination of you know guys under achievement in guys who. You know products should are expected to school or shall I it would be huge to add a top six I mean if they could. If they of figuring right wing to take a plug right in would be ideal in all but you know and in the NH idea I have to give up to get something. But the Bruins to a lot of prospects I mean a lot of good ones right now. I don't know who would you want a pot with or even who's available like it's just like exits really too early in the it even speculate is there's so many teams still alive he. I think another month the showed that the kind of you separate the wheat from the chafe a little bit and you get a much better idea or vie exactly who's going to be selling that the deadline. No Bergeron is six games a lot of point. Longest stretch for him since November 2013 month. Martian as scored in five games. So like you say look back the last year those guys had to wash it certainly did 37 goals yet career year. So now he's off to a five goals start. Seventeen games maybe that's just the biggest reason but it's hard to blame those guys because the lines still pretty good posture next been producing. I mean I think they'll come out and I'm not worried about that group but our other teams finding a recipe to beat the Bruins and that's displayed simple take that line out you know. Now I don't think this variant of a recipe I mean how big is really choose many mystery or a win hockey mean in ya. Shut down at the top two lines it just it just the chess match between coaches and who they decide to put help yet for each guy. You know the they have Bergeron marsh on prospect I mean that's a mama stay I think bill 12 and three while Martin. I forget who's one who's too that the the top three guys in possession in the possession metrics I mean Colin I think course before course he won the possession mattered. You go fifty cents a gallon a day yeah outlaws the rear admiral that's not not Ahmad Ali semite anti I don't I just Denon and end all be all there a good indicated they can help ball you know. You know and when those three guys are all open all its 61%. I think I'm in the top three in the league that does they'd they have a puck pretty much all the time. They are getting opportunities I mean Bergeron getting 45 shots a game it's just his shooting percentages ridiculously low actually ball. Might buy bride actually wrote about in today's EI comet is has gone up yet rob just said he's put an optional. And I met I talked about a shooting percentages I think three point 8% this year which is well below is that. It's not a good exercise could and it it's you know well below his career average of I wanna say ten point one of some potential. You know it's it's probably a bit dad puck block and it that's again a hockey cliche but. You know what he's get up Tony he's getting shots that just it is not on his way right now. But you know that these guys these tools Bergeron a marsh on the dynamic duel they're proven commodity. If there's any two guys you don't have to worry about those two. That this is right you know a little slump I mean it is uncharacteristic Bergeron I think he's would it east play it's in fourteen games in. He had a goal went five games and old anything head to a systemic Goldman the last six games as batting eventual that is very unusual for him by. I get he's he's playing. Bergeron hockey out there he's going as being a ball that is the ice you worry about him to get a chance yeah so I I you know that'll they'll come around I mean. You know about the got to get another win and it sure they they have had a little liver rotate and cast on now like to with you know birds on not stopped the season on time and with the injury and then we'll have passed up for a couple games here but. Yeah but those guys you know they'll come around to it means that I should say they'll come back around is they've already been around certain much on decides that. Are you tell us why is the Bruins offense in a bit of fog 23 in the league in offense right now do you believe that the dias fixed at least to the point of six in goals allowed per game. Rask playing. As good as we've seen him. We have a tie Anderson join us he was over its gates date tells what's wrong with David possible QB signaled this also Lyndon byers. LB do to help me out we got we got to crank up a little lamb. Though it was a black Betty out of the battles. The ram jam that we gotta get that going LB comes is that is that is that all the value out that Alan Al becomes and he got a low low Blackberry for activities in that was it examined nearly man that. That was the big there was a big civil back in the day. While he told me listen last week he was once so either he's coming into slap us around a little bit that wanted to be part of the frame when you do it we take. Yeah tomorrow Marcella stepped in and nobody I would take your calls go to next six or 7777837. Its next 37937. It's Saturday seat rock you by AT&T it's our market tailored and rear admiral here on Sports Radio done media. You were listening to Saturday skate with Ryan Whitney. Rear admiral and Ken layered on Sports Radio WEEI. I think we have to produce a little bit more. Or it's sort of the win. I came here and I know some close scores through four also arrested there are chances. And that's an open office was furious. Brad marsh Jenny or Saturday skate but you may eighteenth tee and star market Taylor rear admiral Tai Anderson from a website to be I don't count joining. Our show one of the few guys that think after that Minnesota game. That was spewing that we got to score more you know. Most of that chatter that her they game Wallace at bad bounce offside play rear that you referenced in noble. Will be better down the road kind of a fluke he lost but other martians. Summed up what I was feeling just as a spectator Hague can bury some of those chances. I think beard down as my favorite hockey play cliche able to sound like we got the bid down like that is. The eye pucks in deep beats that man died yeah I don't Beers he had done it's just it's just Ali any team any play can sit and any losing night and the you know I'm not knocking those guys it's. You know of those guys that did this train to say is puck liked to talk without saying as little as little as they have to. The I I loved beard down we need to be a down and a it's just Yahoo! just likes the because it down it's not the same and we we gave our Ellen didn't come up and we gonna try again next week you're holding them all waters and are not exist this is they got to throw throw all the hockey cliche is a great it is is he could play big goal at the Manila's and so I'm update our march on him by any stretch as any player like your sanity losing team any night. He you're guaranteed if you like the same five or six races throughout the locker room. Cliche city practice this morning attire they they are right for. Luckily for tonight's game not that they understand need to establish home ice advantage. They simply don't have one right now on hand for two years I played that much that's exactly so they understand that to come out pot's not mean being out that's a big thing for them in the need to find scoring. From somebody else lineup that hasn't been consistent enough. So it knows why in any answers one what's Raleigh office north senior. Yeah show it and think yep yep some guys pulling out position I think Ryan Spooner on the wing is not nearly as effective as Bryant's clearance center. I I think you you have some guys that. Have necessarily stepped up in the way you thought they would. You know I look at a guy like Jimmy Hayes at Annapolis in that regard. A blessing game's coming around for sure and I think Hayes has been better these last two games but still you expect more goals those guys I think on a nightly basis. And and for me I think a big thing comes back down tipper front martian. Teams are sort of adjusting to what these guys have done and what they've had success with over the past 2235. Years for that matter. On special partly o's and teens really eliminating that bumper rolled up Bergeron has taken on that's limiting his chances on nightly basis. And I think teams now they realize that Brad marsh and as an elite player in this league and they have to defend improperly and see you're seeing teams really serve load up on these two guys. And I think what you get beyond that you don't necessarily have the talent. You know you have a Louis arch from a third lines such like make fun of them you know for Louis Erickson forty dead. There was a legitimate secondary scoring presence but Louis Ericsson and and they don't have that right now Backus is great but if you're relying on back score thirty goals are pregnant you're probably disappointed more often than not he's got three at this point. I mean. He's been a disappointment. But now I I had mpeg than tangible pats them for about 25 you know like I in the Dallas unreasonable. Again and I would not necessary had that before I watched the play us but what's in the playoffs he he still looked to me like a guy like let a lot left in the tank yet the elbow thing he's on pace for what fifteen now so that would be below the everybody's expectations keeps up this way yeah but he missed a chunk of Eagles all against Columbus writes. All which has not had actually the most impressive win lately look at the jackets it looked pretty good and yet they've exceed they spout off stuff everyone thought ought to ought to roller ball of blob but then I mean they've won three in a row there and the eight seed right now and you know I think it's safe to say they'll affiliates in the bronze and we balance football player oppositional for the rest of the season if they wanna game Calvert which puck in the face last guests on yeah 36 stitches and gimmicks and angle that's hockey player right I was lost. Now tie housed armed palace that the crowd been the last couple games I have been in the bill dispassionately to wheat and security than a much by. I know that caves game it was it was good it was is probably the best it's been all yep but it is across the Montana black. The buffalo crowd history I think that was I think the Columbus crowd. Obviously the Bruins scored four goals early helps but but I I think you're seeing some more energy in that building and one of the big problems that you really don't have. The rhythm that you need a you know for home team to get to get the crowd and aside it's been one and then three away right three away right it's been tough so I think it's been tough sledding for the for the Bruins fans in the crowd. Because they don't feel it energy don't feel that closeness of the team hopefully this trip this homestand rather gives them that. That's her feeling to get some good games Patrick lining come to town yeah. And then next week if saint Louis blues always great team that he feels that he Hilton's climax of the blues will be out in full force. It or interception. I shouldn't I mean the supplier of the year so if you can't get up for a Black Friday game at the holiday weekend. Come on yeah I'm gonna X an old village and town on the LA. Used to be a matinee every every day. I every every it was a matinee game and then they stay switched it back we'll switch to it not back switched its I did the Rangers are yet about Nate NBC took it from them can be out basically and then of the Bruins a plan the night gamers gallery because actually I'm gonna he had that game myself because sound. School that's our rail homecoming because he's he's from tactically Arizona than the mid west but I am that you can Jack who's still has a lot of CME and enable it he's going to be plan. Well presumably in the lap the Calgary that night he's obviously a local ties dad come from mom while Retief meet Boston and with the method. At a hell of an NHL career and now is kids you know 25 years after Keith broken delete his son's broken instantly so. Should be fun it'll watch out general pulse slowed the son of a local legend anyways to vote go see him on the affords. We'll speak edit it seems imminent. You that you would take tonight a look this is one of those western teams I'm looking forward to seeing which is he wants prior in the year and the brewers handle them but. As opposed to last week which that a bit of a tough watch when two of the worst teams in the league last week Arizona Colorado. Just think in a yet to be a bit of purest the watched the wild played another third good scenery decent squad rather boring yeah or sell more important Buzek a most office chairs the nets know there should still after that game. I dominated early MS and this is Alzheimer not gonna get back and I hope everyone realizes that this is we are not getting his minutes back ally unfortunately but here's an exciting team with two release dorsal league yeah he'll want AZ eighteen shy -- been put on the map at six leave no leave lead in the NHL scoring 22 points are now. Very impressive self. You wanna seed Justine and they got a guy back torture rates and whether this team rule or make up blockbuster or is in the market for traits deal. Jake a true book we talked been about last week on Saturdays game. Who finally came inside he wanted to ask to be traded. Eventually signed a two year deal. You get to watch this play tonight and decide is this is this a guy that you really would we'll see the Bruins did make a deal for the were able to get an end. Could he spark into a in on not only better play a is it really generating nearly the offensive numbers is that kind of a silent killer for the team right now. Yeah right now I mean you don't have production to me back and in terms of points and goals and sometimes you talk to people most say Al goals by defensemen that's fool's gold you care they bank on that. But the truth is that the Bruins were they don't have anything from their back and right now to recruit gets a goal off Scott Arnold's butt and that's that's basically what you've had for scorn from that back and so far so. That's simply concern you as funny about true is. The other Naimi heard that next that your about. Was Matthew gamba from from Minnesota and we've seen done that twice now this year and both times I left on my guys not very impressive does that give away it was sun at all as brutal and yeah so I I look at troop that I am a similar light we're I think a lot of people don't necessarily see. Juba enough to be like us sell the whole farm farm killed Karla gave up crew get it anyone they offer for Jacob sure about that such a good test I think to see how he handles. A quicker Abbas and you know wing wing court than you're used to seeing in the past so. But at the chirp I mean this guy who. Now he's an ease and it. Top pairing top three kind of role as see how he handles these men especially are on the road against a team like Boston. A team that. Has been dumping the puck for not scoring so let's see if if he. Changes the way that is has been going for the Bruins and and for the jets for that matter what would you give up for troop whoa whoa the gas of people there were like. Yeah 33 or four player trade you ask the ask was Carlo Spooner and a first round pick and maybe maybe even a little bit more prospect lies that stuff. But the caller. Yeah having seen I mean it may be people to sit yeah out of that sight unseen with cal as we did know will be added at bud. Yeah I'd have a hard time throwing him in any trade right now just done like he says this is 190 going to be twenty sooner what we've seen out of him just this first year. I mean that's the skies for Ritalin with the kid I wouldn't I'd I'd put him on my littlest of untouchables right now. Now Rask is point so well. It looks like. A team that if they get into the playoffs could steal a couple of series but you know going back the offseason. The biggest chip that the proposed seven people were talking about to trade was probably took. Yeah some people wanted to mount after it printed a down year for him and and defense problem. Is there any thought I know he's got a no trade clause now. Probably another adds another year and Sudan as this summer yes the modified on he would bring somebody called last week a series instead. Trade immigration we talked about that their rear. But if you're gonna sell you're gonna sell when guys played well. What about trading Rask in a blockbuster if he would get back on eighteen you know the goaltender in return. A top four defenseman. Is it can even considerate enough like it would collapse right now they it is Tuukka Rask in the net but. If you try to piece in. Mom what it seems to need goaltending help Saint Louis Dallas and that it used to but they've made some. She he had doubts that seed now that they had treatment dallas' you know Dallas is gonna expect you to take one of the awful goaltenders in return and then terrible salary that they signed him to a immunity if if the Bruins ever treated Rask I don't care who they brought back. It might unless it was PDs type stick and included what do you cleared juggling birth rate. I mean offensive minded defenseman and house and it to bring an anti Niemi and Gary let him back I I wouldn't be good. Sign off on Apple's I mean those guys just a big I mean it didn't Emmy did win a cup 2010 Blackhawks he was Palestinian. Sensed any what he went sign of San Jose as a free agent did social media. Oh to Dallas has been batted down lists compared to is its on time in Chicago. Gary Latin and that's hasn't gotten it done down here I mean I just. I don't even think of trade raster as anywhere even like close to the Bruins rated guy and I mean that it's something that anyone there is even considered as a why why would. A mile someone blew real way at some awful. Did you know that you'd give you wanna trade Rask that you're gonna you gonna still lead the number one goal and you needed proven number one goal I don't think it's anywhere near the Bruins six. Bennett showed anything it might it might be more realistic possibility yeah I think one of the big things through that with a two day trading after it considers that it's not a great market for goalies right now. You know next summer Ben Bishop is a free agent and he's probably gonna go to whatever whatever one of these cities were talking about that would trade you. That would treaty pieces for two grass so. The so bad this a bad market if you're if you're if your team kind tradable tender. Mimic it like it Andrew Hammond yup on waivers today by the Ottawa Senators and this is a goalie that sort of stole the show not Hamburg look at no I know bad news right now but that'd I think is a bad market for goalies that's the big thing that observant. Pushing all summer and keyboard talking about trading to their ask it was like OK you'll. First volleys he's come he was coming off a bad season as for his worst season essential career. Suddenly it was a great market for goalies you have Brian Elliott on the movie had Ben Bishop almost on the movie he'd talked to cap Calgary. They could make a trade he couldn't Hebron extensions that didn't happen. An and you look elsewhere and I mean this is a lot of guys that are sort of the lot of teams there are waiting for that for trademark after a flurry is great example of that Pittsburgh where. Members clearly the guy and he will be the guy. They just a matter of finding a suitor for Marc-Andre flirt if you will slow it not a great market triple. I would if you're gonna make a trade which you consider. Great sheet or some member of the court more on this coming up Saturdays he continues are brought by eighteenth tee it's our market Kelly rear admiral Tai Anderson from the UI dot com.

It succeeds the 8th generation "Cannon Lake" family of notebook processors (which likely doesn't see a desktop launch), and the 7th Gen Core "Kaby Lake" socket LGA1151 processors slated for January 2017. While it's not known if mainstream desktop "Coffee Lake" chips will continue to be based on the LGA1151 socket, the possibility is diminishing, looking at a platform layout diagram leaked to the web by Benchlife.info, supported by new connectivity interfaces coming out of the CPU package. The biggest selling-point of "Coffee Lake," is its core-count. The 9th generation Core "Coffee Lake" family could introduce Intel's first 6-core processor to the mainstream desktop platform. The company's first 6-core client part was launched in its LGA1366 HEDT (high-end desktop) platform with the Core i7 "Gulftown" processor, way back in 2010. An increase in core-count from 4 has eluded the mainstream-desktop lineup. The 6-core "Coffee Lake" silicon will be built on a highly-refined 14 nm node by Intel, with a die-size of 149 mm². Quad-core parts won't be carved out of this silicon by disabling two cores, but rather be built on a smaller 126 mm² die. For reference, the quad-core "Kaby Lake" die is expected to be 123 mm², and the current quad-core "Skylake-D" die measures 122.6 mm².

Anyways, I guess with Coffee Lake they are just replacing the GPU with two extra cores? I wonder if it will be super expensive, or whether the 'E' processors will come down in price when you can get a 'mainstream' 6-core from Intel.

Having affordable 6 cores CPUs is what Intel gonna need if AMD succeeds with ZEN. With DX12 and recent games support for more cores, consumers finally can achieve 144fps for 144hz panels in CPU demanding games like BF1/4.

As soon as the iPhone 7 was released users began notice a difference in download speeds between the Verizon iPhone 7 which features a Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE modem and the AT&T version which has an Intel XMM7360 modem. Cellular Insights performed tests which concluded that the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant. Recently, Bloomberg reported on testing by Twin Prime which determined that although the Verizon model is faster than the Intel model, it still is not as fast as it could be. The Samsung Galaxy S7 which also uses the Qualcomm X12 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” Now, sources tell Re/code that it's true, Apple has limited the speed of the Qualcomm modem in the Verizon iPhone 7 to make it perform at about the same speed as the Intel modem. Apple supposedly did this for a simple reason: It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible (to avoid angering AT&T and T-Mobile and their customers in the U.S., for example). Apple's official comment on the matter: “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models."

Try out a new MBP, iPhone 7, or newer iteration of any Apple product and compare it to other devices in the same genre now on the market. The MBP used to lead the way for powerhouse computers. Not any more. Also, check out the Facebook page "FireTimCook". It's a chronological record of how Apple is dying under the helm of this exceedingly boring, dull and small-minded idiot. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam The iDevice Pro - 2 hours ago Just like he took the "Pro" out of the MacBook Pro this year, Tim Cook is also destroying the iPhone. It's both sad and disgusting at the same time. If he isn't stopped, the MacBook will become no better than the PC and the iPhone will become no better than an Android. Or maybe it's already to that point, but as an avid Apple supporter for so many years, I just don't want to see or believe it. What's next, Tim? Bastardize OS X (macOS) as well? Make it installable on all platforms just so you can get more money? He is destroying the brand that was once so great. Something needs to be done to stop him before it's too late, if it isn't already. I have never disliked anyone as much as I dislike Tim Cook. To destroy something that was so wonderful, beautiful and cherished by so many for the sake of revenue...no....GREED is atrocious.

Forgot to Mention thing about this article they do not mention that I forgot to put in the last comment is that they disable !!! !! EVS HD voice that tmobile services offer But can no longer get if you purchase the new iPhone 7 or 7+ But possibly disabled the feature for all iPhones my question is did they disable this feature and slow the QUALCOMM speed down on all iPhones Not just the seven ?? ??? Maybe possibly we might see them slowing the operating speed down to the iPhone 2G A.k.a. Known as that iPhone 1 It's hard to even load a webpage or a YouTube video on LTE you can forget about it Apple needs to stop screwing over their customers and give people what they want and do not sell different models with different chips of iPhones But I think there's a more point to this why did they choose to use these phones AT&T and T-Mobile is it because they did not want their services roaming on other networks therefore they do not have to pay the networks that they are roaming on Therefore AT&T and T-Mobile saving money What's really going on ??????

The classic coffee machine discounts are in effect too, so don't be buying any machinery in advance this year. "This year Black Friday hits on November 25 - be there or be square" Last year Currys even made sure that it avoided those problems of stock shortages, and people shouting at superstores by ramping up stock levels by 40%, which says a lot about the growth of Black Friday in the UK. Even so, don't miss out and make sure you check for deals early on the day - we'll be here to make that easier too.  What Currys did on Black Friday last year: During the run-up to last year's sale Currys' Stuart Ramage said "We saw record-breaking sales last Black Friday so, for this year’s event we’ve worked hard to offer our biggest number of lowest-ever deals on a range of fantastic brands, starting today". This was clear from the claim that Currys made about increasing stock levels to meet demand. For customers this is a great time to snag a bargain, but it's also becoming a really important part of the retailer calendar too, which is why they are investing in promoting the event.  Top 5 Currys Black Friday deals from 2015: 1. HP 15-ac151sa 15.6-inch This decent laptop was going for just £200 at Currys last Black Friday - if you're old like us then you'll remember when laptops cost thousands - great deal on a nicely specified machine that comes with Windows 10 2. Samsung 60-inch 4K TV This home cinema telly was on sale for just £899 at Currys last Black Friday, another reminder of just how cheap tech is these days, but one of Samsung's HDR UHD TVs is a great buy at this price. 3. iPad Pro 12.9 Currys also had a nice iPad Pro price drop last Black Friday, down to £799 - not the world's most enormous discount, but the iPad Pro is a great tablet and Apple discounts are rare. At the time it was the cheapest iPad Pro deal out there. 4. Blenders! Because 2015 was the year of juice, Currys was selling the NINJA Nutri Ninja Slim QB3001 Blender for £39, which was half-price. This year you can certainly expect loads of deals on kitchen goods like blenders and bread makers. 5. Dyson Animal Another great deal was the Dyson V6 Animal, a cable-free vacuum cleaner that was reduced to just £239 - over £100 off! Dysons are great but they're generally very pricey, which makes Black Friday the ideal time of year to buy one.  Currys  Black Friday deals to expect in 2016: 1. TVs, all the TVs. Expect to see even more deals on those large ultra HD Samsung screens again as well as from all of the other big TV brands. If you're looking for 60-inch entertainment, Currys will have your back. 2. Apple might upgrade the iPad Pro soon, so perhaps more discounts on the two excellent tablets this year? The fact is that iPad sales have slowed dramatically of late so some discounting is almost inevitable to move stock. 3. This year's washing machines will likely see a discount. Keep an eye out for those from Samsung and LG, which offer big features at a low price. Always shop around, obviously, but Currys will be a good place to check first on these ite 4. Last year Currys had big PC and laptop discounts, so expect more of that this year - this is a great time to grab a bargain. 5. If you're put off by the high cost of a Dyson, then Black Friday might be the ideal event - keep an eye out for more low prices on cleaners.  How to find the best Currys Black Friday deals:  It's our job to make sure you get told about the best deals.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date May Be Pushed Back to 2018 in Light of the Recent Release of the Hybrid Surface Book i7 Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 20, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» While there have been reports before the Microsoft event on October 26 that the next iteration of the company’s ultimate laptop line, the Surface Book, might be unveiled during the event along with the Surface Pro 5, it did not happen. The only thing that happened during the event was the release of the latest update to Windows 10 and the unveiling of the hybrid Surface Book i7. The hybrid Surface Book i7 is not as powerful as the rumored specifications, features, and capabilities of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 but it is certainly more than adequate to match up against the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro, which the American tech giant officially rolled out on October 27. If any, one positive thing that the hybrid Surface Book i7 did for the highly-anticipating fans of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 was to quench their thirst for the second iteration of the ultimate laptop line from the Redmondian company. Possible push back imminent However, some critics believe that the recent release of the hybrid Surface Book i7 might have pushed the release date of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 on the retail market. Accordingly, the Redmondian company would not field two similar products in the market at the same time since the Surface Book 2 would come off as a high-end variant of the hybrid Surface Book i7. But the two laptop lines would surely compete for the same market that also has the presence of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro. As such, there are now talks that the release date of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 might be pushed back as far as 2018 since the demand for the original and the recently released hybrid Surface Book i7 remains high, notes Tech Radar. There are also rumors saying that Microsoft Surface Book 2 would come out early next year along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 since both devices shall be using the latest processor from Intel called Kaby Lake. To come with the most powerful processor from Intel As the next iteration of the 2-in-1 hybrid laptop/tablet, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 showcases some of the latest technologies. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to feature 4K resolution with 4K video and 3D graphics playback capability. Its battery may provide a running time of up to 16 hours, details Game & Guide. It can be recalled that the original device and the hybrid Surface Book i7 featured an Intel Core i7 processor so the Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to be faster and more powerful with its new chipset. It can improve graphic performance by 100% due to the 14-nanometer technology, which enhances the chipset by 12% compared to the Intel Skylake or the Intel Core i7 processors. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to have a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a pixel resolution of 3000 x 2000 at 267 ppi. The device may include two full-size USB 3.0 ports, a full-size SD card reader, a mini display port and a headphone jack. The device may also feature a GeForce GTX 965M or GTX 1080 GPU, supported by an extra fan. Microsoft Surface Book 2 is said to arrive with a Surface Pen. There may also be a built-in dock to recharge the accessory. The exterior appearance of the ultimate laptop will most likely remain the same, which means that Microsoft will be focusing on the internal components of the new version. Microsoft may also push the Xbox Play Anywhere program via the Microsoft Surface Book 2. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 has been previously rumored to come out last month along with the Surface Pro 5. But that did not happen.

Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves ― such as who is responsible in the event of an accident ― a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. “Data is the new oil,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said this week during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. “If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations,” Krzanich said. “If not, the car will stop.” Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with “intelligent” roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon’s Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a quick voice request. Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. “Where are you, where you stop, how often, what’s in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience,” Krzanich said. “What music you like, craft choices... that’s an opportunity as well.” He said Intel was investing US$250 million (RM1.1 billion) into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, senior director of industry insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximise profit. “If they know you like to go to Starbucks (they will say) ‘Oh, he always stops at Starbucks,” Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. CJ Frost, an Alexa executive, told a panel that consumers were heading into a world where applications will allow users, for example, to track down friends coming to dinner to ask them to stop on the way and buy a bottle of wine. Security concerns One question on many people’s mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, it will be possible to disconnect at some point. “Consumer privacy is an open question,” said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive. “A smartphone holds a lot of info about the owner but when we provide that info to a service provider, we’re getting value in return,” he added. “It’s the same trade-off with an autonomous car.” Cyber-security was also the topic at a panel discussion during which speakers raised the issue of privacy. “Connected cars have added firewalls against hacking,” Egil Juliussen, director of research at IHS Automotive, told AFP. “Criminals could make the car inoperative and ask money to make it operate again.” In mid-2015, two American online-security researchers demonstrated how easily they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely taking control of the car’s functions, including its braking system. Krzanich said such challenges “will require the industry coming together and collaborating.” ― AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week Edsel and 7 other automotive flops from history Compact MPV from Proton coming soon The China pull factor at the Guangzhou auto show (VIDEO) Autonomous cars ― ‘new oil’ or ‘big brother’?

However the company’s efforts in mobile devices haven’t exactly been been considered successes, and it seems that in the wearables department, Intel could be considering bowing out as well. According to a report from TechCrunch, they have been told by their sources that the company could be stepping back from the wearables market, or even worse, exiting the wearables market entirely. Apparently the company has already informed their employees working in their wearables division about this which could result in some pretty huge layoffs by the end of the year. Some signs from earlier this year that Intel could be backing away include the recall of the Basis Peak wearables that were reported to have been overheating for some users. Instead of issuing replacements, Intel stopped selling the device entirely, and went ahead and announced that they would be shutting down the Peak’s software support by the end of the year. In any case it remains to be seen if these reports are true, but we guess we’ll have to wait and see what Intel has to say about it. In the meantime we guess if you are looking forward to more Intel wearables in the future, maybe don’t get your hopes up just yet. Filed in Gadgets >Rumors. Read more about Intel and Wearable Tech.

Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) on Friday praised Donald Trump’s decision hours earlier to pick Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) to be the next CIA director, calling Pompeo “bright” and a “solid pick.” MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell asked Schiff, who works alongside Pompeo on the House Intelligence Committee as its ranking member, what he thought about the Kansas lawmaker’s ability to serve as CIA director if he is confirmed by the Senate. “I think Mike is a very bright guy. He’s hardworking. I think he understands the agency very well, so he’s a solid pick,” Schiff said. Schiff went on to say that Pompeo was partisan during the Benghazi Committee hearings, but he believes Pompeo can put partisanship aside for the CIA role. “I think he is a very capable choice, so of the three that came out today, I think he was the most solid pick,” Schiff said. Trump made two other key selections for top administration posts on Friday. He named Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) to be his attorney general and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser. Schiff was quite critical of Trump’s decision to give Flynn should an important national security role.

Monica Rizk AND Ron Meisels Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 8:15PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 8:15PM EST Comments AA Intel rallied from $23.50 (U.S.) to $37.90 in 2014 (A-B) and then settled into a bullish technical pattern called a “W” formation (dashed lines). The recent rise above the neckline of the pattern at ±$36 (dotted line) signalled a breakout and the start of a new major up-leg (C). Behaviour indicators including the 40-week Moving Average (40wMA) confirm the bullish status. Current price levels should provide a good entry level; only a sustained decline below ±$33 would be negative. Point & Figure measurements provide targets of $39 and $43. The large “W” pattern supports higher targets. Monica Rizk is the senior Technical Analyst and Ron Meisels is the president of Phases & Cycles Inc. (www.phases-cycles.com).

According to several user reports, users are claiming that instead of identifying the Intel HD Graphics 530 chipset that is supposed to be the integrated GPU in their laptop, the system is instead listing an Intel Iris Pro 580 GPU. Naturally this has led to confusion as some customers thought that they might have somehow gotten an upgrade. It also led to a bit of discontent as this inconsistency was also discovered on MacBook Pros shown off in Apple’s retail stores, leading some to believe that Apple was running higher-specced laptops that could potentially mislead customers, but thankfully that is not the case. According to a source of AppleInsider, this is simply a bug and that the innards and performance of the laptops that customers bought are as advertised. “The problem is a result of mistaken communication between the System Information developer team, and the hardware team. The [Intel HD Graphics] 530 is reporting to the OS right, it’s the System Information app database that’s leading users down the primrose path.” Apple has yet to acknowledge the bug and comment on it, and we have no idea when a fix will be issued to address this problem, but if you do see it when you check your MacBook Pro’s system information, you need not be alarmed.

Trump’s children, who are part of his presidential transition team, also attended the meeting with Atul Chordia, Sagar Chordia and Kalpesh Mehta, according to India's Economic Times.  The business partners are building a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex south of Mumbai. A picture of Trump standing alongside the men while giving a thumbs up was posted on Twitter earlier this week.  Atul & Sagar Chordia, Kalpesh Mehta meets U S President Mr Donald Trump at Trump Towers New York office just now pic.twitter.com/v7D3Uqx03d— DEVENDRA JAIN (@shubham9601) November 15, 2016 The meeting comes as Trump vowed to hand off his business to his three adult children in a blind trust to avoid potential conflicts of interest while serving in the Oval Office. A spokeswoman for Trump told The New York Times that the three Indian real estate executives flew from India to congratulate Trump.  “It was not a formal meeting of any kind,” said Breanna Butler, a Trump Organization spokeswoman. Butler and Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, declined to comment when asked by the Times if the meeting included any discussion of Trump businesses in India or expanding that business.  But Donald Trump Jr. showed interested in expanding the business further in India, Mehta told the Economic Times.  A former deputy editor at GQ India told the Times that he hosted an event at Sagar Chordia’s hotel during the presidential campaign, saying the Indian businessman expressed “elation” about the opportunities Trump’s candidacy could bring.  Trump caught flak earlier this week after his daughter Ivanka was photographed attending a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Trump Tower.  State Department officials noted that Ivanka Trump does not have security clearance and is an executive at the Trump Organization hotel chain.  “Donald Trump’s children and son-in-law have been deeply involved in the transition and selecting who will be part of his administration,” said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director for Citizens of Responsibility and Ethics. "At the same time they are deeply involved in the business. There does not seem to be any sign of a meaningful separation of Trump government operations and his business operations.” Tags Donald Trump   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

Judging just by numbers, it looks that way. According to the latest edition of the Top500 list released this week at Salt Lake City, China currently not only hosts the top two fastest supercomputers in the world, but also ties with the United States for first place in the total number of installed systems. The machine sitting on top of the rankings, called Sunway TaihuLight, is especially remarkable in that it's almost exclusively based on technology developed in China, including processors. What's more, it delivers almost the same performance as the next five most powerful systems on the semiannual list combined. However, many experts, especially those from China, have different views. While China is rapidly on the rise on the global supercomputing stage, the country still has a long way to go to become a peer competitor to the United States, they believe. RAPID DEVELOPMENT "I was quite impressed with the engineering quality of TaihuLight, different from previous Chinese machines," Professor Satoshi Matsuoka from the Tokyo Institute of Technology tweeted after a close look at the system himself at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China, in early November. In particular, Satoshi, a renowned supercomputing expert, mentioned of the machine's "excellent" physical design, "aggressive" designs, "impressive" software and application efforts, as well as "no expensive parts." As a result, he concluded that China "now truly rivals U.S., Japan" in the field of high performance computing (HPC). How things have changed! Back in 2001, none of the systems on the Top500 list were installed in China. "It's clear that there has been a lot of investments in this technology if you look at, maybe, a 15-year timeframe from about 2000 on, China is (now) on a very, very competitive stage," Top500 co-author Horst Simon said in an interview with Xinhua. When asked when China will be a "serious challenger" to the United States in supercomputing, Simon, Deputy Director of the U.S. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, answered with confidence: "Oh, already now." The rise of China in the HPC field will have positive implications for the country's national security, especially after last year's surprising move by the U.S government that, citing security concerns, blocked the supply of Intel chips to four Chinese supercomputing research centers, said Zizhong Chen, a supercomputing expert at the University of California, Riverside. "The fact that Chinese have built the fastest supercomputer using their own CPUs and interconnection networks implies China will not have to worry about any U.S. supercomputer chip ban any more," said Chen. OVERSEAS EXPANSION It's also worth mentioning that China now has four companies among the top 10 vendors of the list: Lenovo, Sugon, Inspur and Huawei. These companies sold 173 systems in total, accounting for one third of the list. In June 2015, there were only 10 such systems from Chinese vendors. "Chinese manufactures like Lenovo and Huawei are doing well globally," said Jack Dongarra, professor of the University of Tennessee and coauthor of the Top500."The others not really, just in China which is a big market." Both Sugon and Inspur, however, told Xinhua at the 2016 supercomputing conference at Salt Lake City, that they're now shifting their expansion focus to overseas markets. "To be honest, our international expansion is still in early stages," Cao Zhennan, general manager of the HPC Department at Sugon. "But it's our next step." PROGRESS IN HPC APPLICATIONS Of course, the numbers aren't everything. While China has demonstrated its strength in hardware, the country does have its shortcomings, such as software. "Supercomputing is a whole ecosystem, it consists of hardware, software, applications, the education, infrastructure, (efforts) to build next generation of scientists, and also I think a certain readiness in universities, research institutes, companies to engage in this," said Simon of Berkeley Lab. "It's very difficult to do these many different things at one time ... so I think it will take a bit longer (to become a supercomputing power), and in that sense, China still has a number of things to accomplish." However, China's progress in HPC applications did impress the highly respected U.S. expert deeply, who recalled a lack of applications for China's Tianhe-1A in 2010 when the machine became the first Chinese system to take over the top spot of the Top500 list. "When the Taihulight system was announced (this June), there were several application presentations and these are very good application presentations, they (Chinese) told me that a lot of Chinese scientists have now learned much faster how to use in the architecture," Simon said. "So I think things have significantly progressed, and there may be still some other things missing, but it's clear, given that the hardware is there, the applications are there, and the infrastructure is there and getting a lot of support, China has made huge progress towards using supercomputers," he said. On Thursday, one of the applications, named "10M-Core Scalable Fully-Implicit Solver for Nonhydrostatic Atmospheric Dynamics," was awarded the 2016 ACM Gordon Bell Prize, a top honor in supercomputing, at the 2016 supercomputing conference. It is the first time a Chinese application has won the award. STRONG SENSE OF CRISIS The most noticeable weakness in China's HPC industry was its heavy dependence on U.S. processors. "China imports a lot of semiconductors. If you look at today, semiconductor is everywhere, in any type of industrial products," Simon said. "So if China has ambitions to grow all the manufacturing of high-end goods, China obviously needs to invest much in semiconductors to have a bigger domestic production of semiconductors. I think that is a big issue." "Without mastering the processor technology, we will never be a supercomputing power," Cao of Sugon said. Liu Jun, Inspur's HPC general manager, stressed he has "a strong sense of crisis" after studying the latest Top500 list. "Most of the U.S. supercomputers are deployed in national laboratories, universities and research institutes, and they have invested a lot in this area and have updated their systems very quickly," said Liu. "But many of our supercomputers are just Internet data centers. In the U.S., they are not considered supercomputers. Universities and research institutes in China need this infrastructure, but our investments for them are small, so much more work needs to be done." "If we are blindly optimistic for these good numbers, the gap between us and the United States will be widened, rather than narrowed, Liu warned.

NOVEMBER 20 ― Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Donald Trump’s election in the US constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I’ve been working on a book about what’s been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that’s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That’s such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you’ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyse enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at “Jeopardy!” or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalisation and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalisation and more globalisation drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn’t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organise vast illicit migration networks to get there. So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilised. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there’s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many others they’ve come faster than they can adapt. That’s why my favourite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called “The Eye,” the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalisation and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we’re all being asked to dance. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them — but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them. More on that another day. ― The New York Times * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week It looks like the Red Shirts are here to stay Dancing in a hurricane ― Thomas L.

Sure, you’ve got a range of options within the two, but when you get down to it, that’s the big choice you’re making. Aside from the shape of the controller and the occasional exclusive game, it doesn’t matter whether the box under your TV is a PlayStation or an Xbox. Similarly, every PC sits under your desk, makes a whirring sound, and has Steam installed. Consoles are always cheaper than PCs up front, but there’s more to the cost of a gaming set up than just the initial sticker price. You’ve got to buy a steady stream of games and, potentially, subscribe to an online service. What do these costs look like in real terms? If you’re looking to invest in a new gaming setup in 2017, how much is it really going to cost you? Sure, consoles are cheaper (that’s just not up for debate), but how much cheaper are they? Let’s dig in and find out. What Does a Gaming PC Cost Anyway?

Read More . A good PC build should be able to last five years. That’s slightly less than a full console generation, but by the end of the PlayStation 3’s life, it had fallen far behind PCs in gaming ability. It wasn’t even a competition at that stage. Halfway through your PC’s life, you’ll probably need to upgrade your RAM, throw in a new graphics card, and so on, so let’s budget another $300 for that. That means the lifetime cost of our reasonably priced gaming PC is $1,200. What About the Consoles? The starting price of a console is a lot cheaper than a gaming PC. Right now on Amazon, a Playstation 4 Pro is going for $399 [CDN$ 499.96/£332] and an Xbox One S is about $349.99 [CDN$ 379.96] depending on the bundle you pick. Let’s assume the same 5 year life for a console. Sure, it’s not a full generation, but we’re a few years into the current one. The only upgrade available for a console is a new hard drive, but there’s no real need to factor that in; most people won’t need one. Sony PlayStation 4 Pro - 1TB Sony PlayStation 4 Pro - 1TB Spectacular graphics - Explore vivid game worlds with rich visuals heightened by PS4 Pro. Buy Now At Amazon $380.00 The big extra cost is online gaming. On a PC, it’s essentially free — as long as you’re not signed up to a MMORPG. On consoles, however, it isn’t. Both PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold cost $59.99 a year. Over a five year console lifespan, that’s an extra $300. And that’s if you buy annually — if you’re subscribed monthly, it’s $9.99 each month for a total cost of just under $600. Xbox One S 2TB Console - Launch Edition Xbox One S 2TB Console - Launch Edition Includes: 2TB Internal Hard Drive Xbox One S Console, 1 Xbox Wireless Controller (with 3.5mm headset jack), 1 Console Stand (for vertical orientation), HDMI cable (4K Capable), AC Power cable, and a 14-day Xbox Live Gold Trial. Buy Now At Amazon $375.95 That puts the total price of a PlayStation 4 at $698.95 and an Xbox one at $649.94. Or up to a max of $998.40 and $949.39 respectively if you’re paying for online services on a monthly basis. Even assuming the worst case, you’re still coming in a few hundred dollars cheaper than our PC. In the best case, a console costs just over half the cost of the PC. Does the Cost of Games Matter? It used to be the case that PC games cost $10 to $20 less than the equivalent on a console. That was because Sony and Microsoft took a cut of every game sold for their platform. Now, for whatever reason, the situation has changed: AAA games cost the same across all three platforms. I checked out some of this year’s biggest releases — games like Dishonored 2, Call of Duty: Infinite War, and Watch Dogs 2 — and all the games cost around $59.99 on every platform. Sure, there’s the odd saving of $0.07 here and $0.03 there, but for the most part it’s $60 flat if you want a new AAA game. If you’re interested in indie titles, you’re always going to have more options on a PC. Releasing a game through Steam is simple compared to trying to get one into Sony or Microsoft’s stores. There are countless smaller games that cost just a few dollars which are available on a PC but not on a console. Offers, like Humble Bundles, make it even easier to pick up cheap titles. The thing is, it’s impossible to compare like with like. If you just play indie games on your PC and someone else only plays AAA titles on their PS4, your lifetime cost for the system might end up lower. But if they mainly play used games while you pick up every major title, you’ll spend three times the money they do. The other complicating factor is that both PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold offer their members free games to play. While you don’t get to pick the titles, there’s a steady stream of awesome games available to play for no extra cost. There are also regular sales through the online stores. The prices might never drop as low as they do on Steam, but you can still regularly pick up awesome older console games for under ten bucks. When it comes down to it, AAA games cost the same where ever you play them and there are cheap options available for every platform. If you mainly want to play indie games because you prefer them, buy a PC, but don’t get one just because you think it will save you money on games in the long run. The Cost of Virtual Reality Gaming is about to change. Over the last few years, virtual reality has gone from fantasy to fantastically awful to functional Virtual Reality Still Has 5 Big Problems to Overcome Virtual Reality Still Has 5 Big Problems to Overcome Despite all of the hype surrounding the recent surge in virtual reality products, there are many challenges that still need to be addressed before VR goes mainstream. Read More . It’s not really here yet, but it will be soon. More and more games are shipping with VR support. At the moment, the Xbox One lags behind the PS4 and PC in terms of VR. Sony offers the $400 PlayStation VR headset (UK), while on PC, the best current options are the $600 Oculus Rift and $800 HTC Vive Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive vs. Playstation VR: Which Should You Buy? Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive vs. Playstation VR: Which Should You Buy? Virtual reality is right around the corner and there are three systems to choose from. Here's what you need to know to make an informed, smart decision. Read More . The prices are obviously going to fall as VR becomes more available, but it’s clear that it’s not magically going to be cheaper on PC. If anything, the console manufacturer’s economies of scale will let them offer VR headsets at a lower price. Other Uses Both games consoles and gaming PCs have other uses outside of playing games: you can use a PS4 or Xbox One as a media center and a gaming PC, is still a fully functioning PC. Since your games console is already plugged into your TV, it makes sense to set up Netflix or whatever streaming services you subscribe to on it. They work well as media centers, although they aren’t quite as intuitive as a Roku or Apple TV. If you just need a way to stream stuff for yourself and other tech-capable people, using your games console will save you a hundred bucks on a set top box. On the other hand, a PC is still a PC. If you want, you can do all your regular computer stuff on your gaming rig. Unfortunately, though, gaming PCs make terrible day to day computers. Unless you’re editing photos or videos, they are massively over powered for most tasks — a video card does very little except run up your electricity bill when you’re on Facebook. If you’ve got a console, you can pick up a budget laptop Best Laptops Under $300: Everything You Need to Know Best Laptops Under $300: Everything You Need to Know Finding a good laptop for less than $300 is almost impossible these days, but can be done if you know what to look for.

You’ll have a dedicated games system and a lightweight flexible PC you can carry around with you. Adding Things Up Whatever way you slice it, games consoles are a cheaper way to play games than gaming PCs. Even a moderately-priced system has a lifetime cost of about twice that of consoles. Sure, you can build a super-cheap rig but it will go out of date faster than the milk in your fridge. If budget and being able to play the latest AAA games are your only concerns, buy a console. I have a PS4 and I couldn’t be happier with it. That’s not to say PCs don’t have a lot going for them. If you love indie games or maxed-out specs, they’re the best way to get them. But don’t kid yourself into thinking you’re somehow saving money because after finishing up gaming you can open a spreadsheet. Gaming PCs have always been, and continue to be, a terrible financial investment. Do you agree or disagree with us? Would you invest more money for a good gaming PC?

You over exaggerated everything negative about PC. Reply Demon Max November 19, 2016 at 1:58 pm Disagree with you, sorry. Not that the article does not have its merits, it's well written and intriguing. Only, PC is so much more than any console...yes, games are released for both systems but quality is quite different (depends on the quality of your PC actually). If you don't have much money to spend, get a console. If you want quality and have the money for it, get a PC. Me? Powerful PC + Nintendo Switch (when it will be out, it will be different in gaming experience than my PC). Thank you for reading.

Susan Campbell/The Hill: Trump’s missteps have been egregious, but then he hired the chief executive of Breitbart News, a right-wing website that’s beloved by white nationalists, everywhere. Wait. Let’s call them what they are. This election, says Richard Spencer, who came up with the phrase “alt-right,” was about “identity politics for white people,” And Breitbart News has become a media standard for both the alt-right and white identity politics.  Don’t believe me? Listen to a recent NPR interview with Breitbart senior editor, Joel B. Pollak, who tried to say that he couldn’t be held responsible for a few racist/misogynistic pieces out of “tens of thousands” of pieces they run. And then he accused NPR of racist content, because of their Code Switch race and identity podcast and blog.

First Read: The Trouble With Mike Flynn Late last night, NBC's Kristen Welker confirmed that President-elect Donald Trump asked retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn to serve as his national security adviser. (The news was first reported by the AP.) But the controversies and ethical baggage around Flynn are problematic. For starters, there are Flynn's statements about Islam and Muslims. "Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions," he tweeted back in February. Critics have argued that Flynn is too cozy to Russia, pointing to a trip to Moscow in which he spent time with Vladimir Putin, as well as a paid speaking engagement with state-run Russia Today. There are questions about his management style, given that he was fired as DIA director, as Welker reported on "Today." And then there is last night's report from Yahoo, which said he began receiving national security briefings last summer while still advising foreign clients. "Flynn's relationship with his overseas clients is coming in for new scrutiny amid recent disclosures that two months ago, during the height of the presidential campaign, his consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group, registered to lobby for a Dutch company owned by a wealthy Turkish businessman close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey." Andrew Kaczynski/CNN: On Twitter, Michael Flynn interacted with alt-right, made controversial comments on Muslims, shared fake news A CNN KFile review of Flynn's Twitter account finds that the retired lieutenant general, who once served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, tweeted routinely with members of the so-called alt-right movement, going so far as to endorse a book by one controversial figure who regularly makes offensive comments. Flynn faced criticism in July when he retweeted an anti-Semitic message. Flynn said the retweet was an accident and deleted the message. Emails to a spokesperson for President-elect Trump and Flynn seeking comment were not returned. A follow up question to Flynn asking who managed his Twitter account also went unreturned. The GOP owns this now. All of it. Maclean’s: As anger and disbelief metabolized into action and activism, an iconography of protest emerged: Post-It notes offering supportive messages were plastered in subway stations and on school washroom mirrors; the safety pin, adopted as a symbol in Australia in 2014 and in post-Brexit U.K. to signal alliance with vulnerable groups, popped up on lapels and social media avatars. Safety pins, denounced by some as merely a “feel good” gesture, weren’t the only gesture denoting fear of what was to come. Non-profits protecting Trump’s avowed targets—civil liberties, women’s reproductive rights, immigrants, the LGBTQ community, the environment, press freedom—saw a spike in donations, aided by sites like Jezebel’s list of “Pro-women, pro-immigrant, pro-Earth, anti-bigotry organizations that need your support.” Within 24 hours, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) received a record high in online donations of some $940,000, a tally that now stands at more than $7.2 million. Trump has become a poster boy for the ACLU, which published a harsh message for the president-elect, promising its “full firepower” should he seek to undermine the Constitution. Its homepage reads: “See you in court,” next to Trump’s photo and a “donate” button. Modern Healthcare: The incoming Donald Trump administration and Republicans in Congress reportedly are rushing to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act within days of taking office, with a possible delay of a year or two while they craft a replacement package. They're also discussing quick administrative moves to unravel the ACA, such as terminating payments to insurers that compensate them for reducing cost-sharing requirements for lower-income exchange plan members. But pro-ACA experts and some insurers warn that repealing the law without passing a replacement, combined with administrative actions undermining the law, could prompt health plans to abandon the individual insurance markets in 2018. That's because insurers have to calculate and submit their 2018 premiums by spring, and that task will be difficult or impossible if they don't know the rules of the new Republican-led system. The turmoil likely would affect both the exchange and off-exchange markets, through which nearly 20 million Americans get coverage, they say. "I would not be surprised by a stampede to exit the market for fear of uncertainty and the strong potential for adverse selection,” said Mike Kreidler, Washington state's insurance commissioner, at a news conference Wednesday organized by the liberal Center for American Progress. Kreidler said he's already gotten calls from nervous insurance leaders and plans to meet soon with the CEOs of the three major insurers in his state, where half a million people have gotten coverage under the ACA. Here, from the Telegraph, is something both campaigns agree on: FBI's decision to reopen Clinton email probe enabled Donald Trump to win election, says former aide Corey Lewandowski Norm Ornstein/WaPo: Donald Trump’s choice of alt-right leader Stephen K. Bannon as top White House strategist suggests that the worst instincts of the president-elect remain intact. The hopes for governance hewing closer to the center, and respecting all those living in the United States, rest with the Senate, and with the behavior and outlook of senators in both parties. For Senate Republicans, this is a critical moment to heed a call their colleague Lindsey Graham (S.C.) made earlier in the campaign — there is a time to put country ahead of party. Reflexive party loyalty now, including blindly confirming all of Trump’s executive and judicial nominees, would violate that maxim. Republicans need to vet thoroughly and firmly all nominees, but especially those who violate basic standards of moderation, civility and respect for constitutional norms. That means racially divisive and bombastic figures such as Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke, who stunningly called on his allies during the campaign to ready their “pitchforks and torches,” and who has been rumored to be Trump’s top choice for homeland security secretary, should be rejected. Paul Waldman/WaPo: Why the filibuster may survive after all — and limit the damage congressional Republicans can do The narrowness of the Republican majority means that Democrats would need only a couple of Republicans to vote with them to deny the GOP the 51 votes it needs to institute a change in Senate rules. And now at least four Republican senators have gone on record saying that the filibuster should stay. Lindsey Graham said emphatically that ending the filibuster would be “a horrible, terrible idea.” Orrin Hatch was even more categorical. “Are you kidding?” he responded when asked by the Huffington Post’s Michael McAuliff whether it should be eliminated. “I’m one of the biggest advocates for the filibuster. It’s the only way to protect the minority, and we’ve been in the minority a lot more than we’ve been in the majority.” And NBC’s Benjy Sarlin reports that Jeff Flake and Jim Inhofe both told him the filibuster should stay. 336 Comments Share this article 123 123 123 336 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Latest reports suggest that Apple is not likely to release the iPhone 8 before September 2017. The company may in the meantime release the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. It’s been just more than a couple of months since Apple released its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, rumours are already on about the next-gen iPhone. As per reports, the Apple iPhone 8 could have a bigger OLED curved display. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus may have 5 and 5.8-inch displays respectively. Apple could be using a bezel-less display to conform to the size of the handset. As per Macworld, Apple did apply for a patent in March 2015 for a bezel-less device. As far other specs are concerned, nothing is known about next year’s Apple iPhone 8 though the company may tie up with Intel for manufacturing the processor for the iPhone 8. There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel. Hence, Apple may choose to shift some of its orders there. It will also be in line with Washington’s policy of encouraging US companies to make products at home. Apple is known for using the best cameras for its smartphones. It also got a patent for a digital camera with light splitter. Thus, this new technology could be incorporated into the Apple iPhone 8 camera. This feature is generally available to professional video cameras. The technology is believed to produce excellent photos even in low light conditions. These are merely rumours and it will be interesting to see whether Apple really introduced these new features in its iPhone 8. Apple is also said to be working with Energous to introduce the wireless-charging technology to Apple iPhone 8. The iPhone can be successfully charged if the owner is within 15 feet of the transmitter, writes BGR.

 10 things you need to know in markets today Oscar Williams-Grut Nov. 16, 2016, 1:48 AM 388 facebook linkedin twitter email print A man walks through a garden on an autumn day in Srinagar, India November 15, 2016. REUTERS/Danish Ismail Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets on Wednesday. EU antitrust regulators are set to fine HSBC, JPMorgan, and Credit Agricole by the end of the year for rigging financial benchmarks linked to the euro, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Reuters reports that charges were levied in May 2014 against the three banks, which denied wrongdoing. The European Commission could penalise HSBC, JPMorgan, and Credit Agricole next month, the people said. The decision has been delayed several times and another hold-up could still occur. Google still plans to open a new UK headquarters building in London, which the BBC reports could create up to 3,000 jobs in the country by 2020. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, told the BBC the company sees "big opportunities" in the UK despite the country's vote to exit the European Union in June. Employment and wage data is coming. UK earnings and job figures for September and October are due at 9.30 a.m. GMT (4.30 a.m. ET). The unemployment rate is forecast to remain steady at 4.9% and wage growth is forecast to be 2.3%, the same as in the prior month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied for a seventh straight day on Tuesday, clinching another record closing high overnight near 19,000. The rout in the bond market finally paused as traders bought Treasurys, sending yields lower for the first time since last week's election. Japan's Nikkei hit a 9 and a half month high. The Japanese stock market closed up 1.1% at its highest level since February, buoyed by the weak yen helping exporters. Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite is down 0.07% at the time of writing (6.25 a.m. GMT/1.25 a.m. ET) and the Hong Kong Hang Seng is up 0.45%. Saudi Arabia will reveal how much oil it is sitting on as it prepares to sell shares in Saudi Aramco. "This is going to be the most transparent national oil company listing of all time," Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. Intel will invest more than $250 million (£200 million) to make autonomous driving a reality. Intel wrote in a press release that the investment will be geared toward advancing tech related to connectivity, communication, deep learning, and cybersecurity for cars. Deutsche Bank has shaken up some of its senior ranks in its US investment bank. The firm has promoted Michael Santini to vice chairman of Americas corporate finance and John Anos to cohead of global industrials alongside Richard Sheppard. Senior Morgan Stanley executives collectively earned about $10.5 million (£8.4 million) over the past week by exercising options and selling shares, with most of them profiting from an election-fueled rally in bank stocks, according to securities filings. The executives made the sales after shares of Morgan Stanley, which traded as low as $22 in the last 12 months, reversed course to become the best performing of the six largest US banks so far this year, closing Monday at $39.35. An aggressive tax avoidance scheme used by temp recruitment agencies is depriving the taxpayer of “hundreds of millions” of pounds a year, a Guardian investigation has found. A number of agencies have been making large windfalls by using “contrived” financial arrangements to slash their employer’s national insurance bills.

Could a similar problem be brewing this year for Apple’s iPhone 7? It’s certainly starting to look that way. According to a report from Bloomberg, it seems that researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights have found that the iPhone 7 on Verizon’s networking isn’t performing as fast as it could, and it could be Apple’s own doing. The researchers have found that testing the phones on AT&T and Verizon’s network yielded similar results, but they also note that the iPhone on Verizon’s network could potentially hit higher internet speeds. If you might recall, it has been discovered that depending on which carrier you use, your iPhone’s modem could either be made by Qualcomm or Intel. Qualcomm’s modem is supposed to be faster with download speeds of up to 600Mb/s, while Intel’s model tops out at 450Mb/s. This means in theory Verizon’s iPhone should be capable of achieving faster download speeds. However some analysts speculate that maybe this was done on purpose to ensure a uniform experience across all iPhones, although right now we’re sure that some iPhone users probably aren’t too thrilled to learn that their iPhones could be artificially limited in some way. According to Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller, “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

The retired Army general has been named to a top post in Trump's Cabinet. Getty By Helin Jung Nov 19, 2016 Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn announced on Friday that he had accepted the position of national security adviser, formally known as the assistant to the President for national security affairs (APNSA). The role does not require a Senate confirmation. President-elect Donald Trump relied heavily on Flynn, a three-star general with 33 years of experience in the military, during his campaign, and had considered Flynn for the running mate job before selecting Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana. Flynn, 57, remained extremely loyal to Trump and has been rewarded for it. Along with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Flynn was present on Thursday when Trump met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.

Here's what you need to know about Flynn: 1. He is a registered Democrat. Raised in Rhode Island, Flynn comes from "an Irish Catholic family of blue-collar Democrats," according to Politico, and was a lifelong Democrat before throwing his support behind the Republican candidate. "I grew up as a Democrat in a very strong Democratic family, he told ABC, "but I will tell you that Democratic party that exists in this country is not the Democratic party that I grew up around in my upbringing." 2. He had an impressive military career. Flynn joined the Army in 1981. He served in Afghanistan and Iraq as the director of intelligence for Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which includes unites like SEAL Team 6. He was then the director of intelligence for the United States Central Command and the director of intelligence for the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, helping to dismantle al-Qaeda networks. President Barack Obama nominated him to be the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency — the CIA of the Pentagon — in 2012. Getty 3. He was ousted from his role as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Flynn was forced to resign after two years in his post, pushed out by the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence. He wrote in the New York Post that he had been trying to "change the culture of DIA." Flynn added, "After being fired, I left the meeting thinking, 'Here we are in the middle of a war, I had a significant amount of combat experience (nearly five years) against this determined enemy on the battlefield and served at senior levels, and here it was, the bureaucracy was letting me go.' Amazing." Meanwhile, leaked emails revealed that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had asked why the now "right-wing nutty" Flynn was fired. "Abusive with staff, didn't listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc." Powell wrote. Shortly after leaving the DIA, Flynn became a vocal critic of Obama. This was looked upon with disapproval by former colleagues. According to Vox, there is a direct connection between his "enmity towards Obama and Clinton" and "his abrupt dismissal from the DIA." He told Foreign Policy, "I'm not going to be a general that just fades away." Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 4. After getting fired, he started a consulting firm called Flynn Intel Group, which is now the source of numerous conflicts of interest. Flynn started getting classified national security briefings over the summer while he was still consulting international clients on intelligence matters, according to Yahoo News. Flynn Intel Group also appears to be lobbying for the Turkish government, and has reportedly been paid thousands of dollars for it. Flynn is also an ally of Palantir, the data analysis company co-founded by Peter Thiel, the Republican billionaire who took down Gawker and gave $1.25 million to the Trump campaign. In a letter addressed to Vice President-elect Pence, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who sits on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote, "Lt. Gen. Flynn's involvement in advising Mr. Trump on matters relating to Turkey or Russia — including attending classified briefings on those matters — could violate the Trump for America, Inc. Code of Ethical Conduct ..." which promises that individuals working with Trump will "disqualify" themselves should there be any conflicts of interest. 5. Early in the race, he advised five Republican presidential candidates before siding with Trump. Flynn said that he had spoken to Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Ben Carson Ted Cruz, and Trump but was ultimately most impressed with Trump, someone who, like himself, he sees as an outsider who speaks bluntly. "This is a guy that provides a different vision, a different way to solve problems, a different leadership style, and a sense of change that I believe that a majority of people in this country are really starting to look at," he told CNN. After the election, Flynn was ecstatic. "We just went through a revolution," he said. "This is probably the biggest election in our nation's history, since bringing on George Washington when he decided not to be a king." Getty 6. He encouraged a "lock her up" chant while speaking at the Republican National Convention. Like Trump, Flynn has been highly critical of Hillary Clinton's emails. "I have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she — she — put our nation's security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server," he said. "Lock her up. Lock her up! Damn right. Exactly right. There's nothing wrong with that!" On two separate occasions, the FBI concluded that Clinton should not face criminal prosecution for her use of her private email server, but Trump has not conclusively said that he would drop the possibility of prosecuting Clinton. The Democratic lawyer Richard Ben-Veniste told the New York Times that such action "would be mimicking the tin-pot dictators of historical disgrace who seek to punish those who have run against them." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 7. Military officials condemn Flynn's partisanship. Adm. Michael Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Washington Post in a statement that Flynn's behavior in the election broke code (Mullen was equally critical of Clinton supporter retired Marine Corps General John Allen). "For retired senior officers to take leading and vocal roles as clearly partisan figures is a violation of the ethos and professionalism of apolitical military service." Two retired officers told Vox that they found Flynn to be "unhinged." 8. He has made numerous Islamophobic statements. In an interview with Al Jazeera in May, Flynn did not denounce Trump's Muslim ban, but he did say that "There must be more precision in the use of the language that he uses as the potential leader of the free world." For his part, Flynn has broadly painted Islam as "a cancer" and has said that "Islam is a political ideology masked behind a religion," shoehorning the world's 1.6 billion Muslims together in language that The Intercept described as showing a "lack of precision," the very critique Flynn had of Trump. Flynn strongly believes that "radical Islamic terrorism" is the single biggest threat to Americans. He is the co-author of a book called The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. In another Al Jazeera interview, Flynn said, "I've been at war with Islam, or a, or a component of Islam, for the last decade." He tweeted in February that "fear of Muslims is RATIONAL" and though the tweet has been repeatedly criticized, Flynn has not backtracked or taken it down. Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU— General Flynn (@GenFlynn) February 27, 2016 9. He hates "political correctness." "Political correctness kills. It will cause death, and we can’t have that," he said on Fox & Friends in September. Flynn has also said, "My God, war is not about bathrooms. War is not about political correctness or words that are meaningless. War is about winning." 10. His position on torture is just shy of an endorsement. Flynn was once against waterboarding, but has softened his stance since aligning with Trump, who has said that he would allow waterboarding and that "torture works, OK, folks?" Flynn claims that as an intelligence officer in Iraq, he helped end abusive interrogation practices. "We were going by the book," he told The Intercept. But instead of renouncing the use of torture or the committing of war crimes, Flynn said this about Trump's statements: "Here's what a guy like Donald Trump is doing: He's basically saying, 'Hey, look, all options are on the table,' and being very unpredictable in the face of a very determined enemy." Human Rights Watch says that Flynn shows "a stunning contempt for the Geneva Conventions and other laws prohibiting torture." Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 11. He appears to be cozy with Russia and Vladimir Putin. "Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security," the Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, Jr. said in July during his confirmation to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In an interview with NPR, Flynn seemed to agree, saying that enemies of the United States included, "certainly, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, countries like Cuba, certainly China." Yet Flynn traveled to Moscow on a paid trip in 2015, appearing on RT, Russia's state-run news organization. He likened RT to CNN. "It was a paid speaking opportunity," Flynn told the Washington Post. "I get paid so much." Flynn was seated very close to Putin at a gala, and called the symbolism of it "boring," saying that he "didn't have any problem" with the optics. According to Politico in May, Flynn had continued to make "semi-regular appearances on RT as an analyst." 12. He used to be pro-choice but flip-flopped immediately after his views were criticized by conservatives. Flynn said on ABC that "Abortion, I think for women, these are difficult issues. I think that's a difficult legal decision, and I think that women are so important in that decision-making process. They are the ones that have to make the decision because they are the ones that will decide to bring up that child or not." He later "clarified" to Fox News that he was a "pro-life Democrat" and that "I believe the law should be changed." Getty 13. He had to apologize for a sexist dress code presentation that went out to employees while he was at the DIA. In January 2013, DIA employees were provided a presentation on dress code (obtained by MuckRock through a Freedom of Information request). Male and female employees were advised on how to "look sharp, feel sharp, be sharp" in their professional appearance. But there was a sexist bent to the section for women. "Do not advocate the 'Plain Jane' look," the presentation said. "Makeup helps women look more attractive." It also said that women should "consider your body type" when choosing clothing, and "accentuate the positive/disguise the negative." Flynn later apologized in an email to his staff. "I've now seen [the presentation] and I too find it highly offensive," he said. He listed what it really takes to be successful (makeup was not on there) and said that "Neither the agency nor I condone this briefing and I only hope the intention to execute this task was pure of heart and intended to help ... but even smart people do dumb things sometimes." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 14. Flynn and his son have been accused of being racist, sexist conspiracy theorists who love fake news. CNN reported on Thursday that Flynn's son, Michael G. Flynn, has a tendency to post bogus news stories and bigoted statements on social media. The younger Flynn works for Flynn Intel Group and is his father's chief of staff, according to CNN. "Unfortunately, only reason minorities voted for BO is the color of his skin and NOT for the issues," he wrote in a tweet during the 2012 election. He reportedly deleted the post after CNN asked him to comment, but the news outlet captured the tweet in a screenshot before it got taken down. CNN also pointed out that the younger Flynn wrote on Facebook in early November that Gloria Allred was a "commie" trying to "get the heat off the witch." Son and father seemingly have this quality in common. While at the DIA, Flynn was "so prone to dubious pronouncements," according to the Washington Post, that these statements had a name: "Flynn facts." Business Insider reported that Lt. Gen. Flynn has promoted conspiracies that Hillary Clinton was involved in "sex crimes with children" and "money laundering." He also suggested that Hillary Clinton had conspired with Jews in an anti-Semitic tweet (he retweeted the statement "Not anymore, Jews. Not anymore") that he later deleted and apologized for. 15. Flynn told women in his office to wear makeup, heels, and skirts. Women in the Defense Intelligence Agency were told to monitor their levels of makeup, avoid flats, and err on the side of skirts and dresses when the organization was run by Flynn. Yes, that happened. Follow Helin on Instagram.

When you install a snap, you know that you don’t need to install additional dependencies (besides the automatically-installed core snap that provides the basic operating system layer), and it will simply work on every Linux distribution that supports snaps. Here, we show how to create self-contained snap packages for Qt-based applications, and we show an additional approach where some of the app dependencies are provided by a separate snap: the Ubuntu app platform snap. The platform snap provides an (optional) approach for the software provider, and can save disk space in some cases. Below we will explain the two approaches to building a snap for Qt-based software: a snap that is self-contained and includes Qt, and one that uses the platform snap, and we show the advantages of each approach. However, before showing these two approaches that you can apply to your own QML code, we demonstrate how to create a snap from deb packages in the Ubuntu archive so that you can get started right away even before you write any code. We assume that before reading this blog post, you have acquired knowledge about how to use Snapcraft. So if you haven’t, we recommend reading the documentation on snapcraft.io and the snap-codelabs tutorials. All the commands that are listed below are executed on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS machine with the stable-phone-overlay PPA enabled. Some of the snapcraft commands may run on other configurations, but for the “Ubuntu App Platform Snap” section it is a hard requirement because the version of Qt - upstream 5.6 long term support version - and other libraries used to build the snap need to match the versions in the ubuntu-app-platform snap. Installing the snap packages works on different versions of Ubuntu and even different Linux distributions. The examples were tested on amd64 architecture with Intel graphics. If you are running this on a different CPU architecture, naturally the architecture in the directory and snap file names listed below must be modified. If you have an Nvidia GPU and use the Nvidia proprietary drivers there can be problems when running some snapped applications, so in that case we currently recommend to use the open source Nouveau drivers. The examples are also available in a repository linked to from the Evaluation section. Qt cloud parts - a simple use case We will demonstrate how to build a simple app snap that includes the Qt release and Ubuntu UI Toolkit (UITK) from the Ubuntu archives. For this example, we use the UITK gallery which is part of the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples deb package on classic Ubuntu systems, so no additional code is needed. Because of that, we can simply use the nil plugin and pull in the examples as stage-packages. We create a directory called uitk-gallery which contains only a snapcraft.yaml file with the following contents: 
name: uitk-gallery
version: '0.1'
summary: Showcase gallery that demonstrates the components in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit.
description: |
  See https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/ for the API documentation of the components.

confinement: strict

parts:
  ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples:
    plugin: nil
    stage-packages:
      - qmlscene
      - qml-module-qtqml-models2
      - ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples
    after: [desktop-qt5]

apps:
  uitk-gallery:
    command: desktop-launch "qmlscene $SNAP/usr/lib/*/qt5/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml"
    plugs: [unity7, opengl]
 (notes: the command line assumes you are on and targeting amd64 system. the plugs line is needed so that you have access to graphical subsystem from your confined app) Under stage-packages we listed all the packages that need to be pulled from the Ubuntu archive, including their dependencies. ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples contains all the QML code for the UITK gallery that we want to run using qmlscene. We also included qml-module-qtqml-models2 because some pages of the UITK gallery import QtQml.Models. The line after: [desktop-qt5] fetches the desktop-qt5 part from the remote parts repository. It will automatically pull in Qt 5 from the Ubuntu archive, set-up environment variables, and provide the desktop-launch script that is called to start the app. The snap file can be created simply by going to the uitk-gallery directory which contains the snapcraft.yaml file, and running: 
snapcraft Note that Snapcraft will ask for the sudo password to install the Qt5 dev packages that are required to compile Qt apps, but can be left out if all the dependencies are already present. Running snapcraft will create (on an amd64 machine) the file uitk-gallery_0.1_amd64.snap which can then be installed by: 
snap install --dangerous uitk-gallery_0.1_amd64.snap where the dangerous parameter is required because we are installing an unsigned snap that does not come from the Ubuntu store. Note that you do not need to use sudo if you have logged in with snap login. The UITK gallery can now be launched using: 
uitk-gallery The desktop-qt5 cloud part pulls in the current stable version of Qt of the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS release - 5.5.1 normally or 5.6.1 in the case of stable overlay PPA. To uninstall the UITK gallery snap before going to the next section, run: 
snap remove uitk-gallery QML project using parts from the cloud If your existing QML code is not available as a deb package, then obviously you cannot pull it in from the archive when creating the snap using stage-packages. To show how to include your own QML code, we copy the UITK gallery code to the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery directory inside the snapcraft (uitk-gallery) directory. Go to the parent directory of the uitk-gallery of the previous section, and run: 
bzr branch lp:ubuntu-ui-toolkit
cp -R ubuntu-ui-toolkit/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery uitk-gallery/ Alternatively, if you have the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples package installed, you can run: 
cp -R /usr/lib/*/qt5/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ uitk-gallery/ You should now have both the snapcraft.yaml and the copied ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery directory that contains the source code of the UITK gallery under the uitk-gallery. We can now remove the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples from the stage-packages in the snapcraft.yaml file. Because that line is removed, the dependencies of the UITK gallery are no longer pulled in automatically, and we must add them to the YAML file, which then becomes: 
name: uitk-gallery
version: '0.2'
summary: Showcase gallery that demonstrates the components in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit.

  ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery:
    plugin: dump
    source: .
    stage-packages:
      - qmlscene

apps:
  uitk-gallery:
    command: desktop-launch "qmlscene $SNAP/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml"
    plugs: [unity7, opengl]
 Note that besides the changes in stage-packages, also the location of ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml was updated in the uitk-gallery command because the QML files are no longer installed in usr/lib inside the snap, but copied in the root of the snap filesystem. As before, the snap package can be created by executing: 
snapcraft inside the uitk-gallery directory. The UITK gallery can then be installed and started using: 
snap install --dangerous uitk-gallery_0.2_amd64.snap
uitk-gallery and uninstalled by: 
snap remove uitk-gallery Now that you have seen how to package the UITK gallery from source into a snap, you can do the same for your own QML application by using the dump plugin with the dependencies as stage-packages. If your application includes C++ code as well, you need to use another plugin, for example the qmake plugin. For that we refer to the Snapcraft tutorials mentioned in the introduction. For those who like to experiment with newer versions of upstream Qt, we provide qt57 and qt58 cloud parts in the parts repository for Qt 5.7.1 and 5.8 (in development). However, the qt57 and qt58 cloud parts do not yet include a wrapper script similar to desktop-launch, so one must be included with with snap configuration, see for example timostestapp2. When using these cloud parts, you should usually omit any Qt/QML package from stage-packages, as the ones compiled from newer Qt are used directly, and you should also omit the after: [desktop-qt5]. Ubuntu app platform snap The snap files we created in the previous sections contain everything that is needed in order to run the UITK gallery application, resulting in a snap file of 86MB. Here we will explain how to use the Ubuntu app platform snap when you have multiple app snaps that all use the same Qt version. Benefits of this approach include disk space saving, download time and bandwidth usage if metered. When your snap uses the ubuntu-app-platform snap for Qt and other platform libraries, we can remove the stage-packages from the snapcraft.yaml file because (in this case), all the needed libraries are included in ubuntu-app-platform. We must also replace after: [desktop-qt5] by after: [desktop-ubuntu-app-platform]. This will set-up your snap to use the global desktop theme, icon theme, gsettings integration, etc. A more elaborate description of the desktop-ubuntu-app-platform is given in the parts list on the Ubuntu wiki. In the uitk-gallery directory we must currently create a directory where the files from the platform snap can be mounted using the content interface: 
mkdir ubuntu-app-platform and this empty directory (mount point) must be added in the YAML file as well. At this point the directory structure is as follows: 
uitk-gallery/
 .. snapcraft.yaml
 .. ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/
    .. [gallery contents]
 .. ubuntu-app-platform/
 The whole YAML is: 
name: uitk-gallery
version: '0.3'

        target: ubuntu-app-platform # the mount directory created

apps:
  uitk-gallery:
    command: desktop-launch "qmlscene $SNAP/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml"
    plugs: [platform, unity7, opengl]
 Again, the new snap file can be created using: 
snapcraft This time, before we can use the snap, the ubuntu-app-platform snap must be installed and connected to the new uitk-gallery snap. So, execute the following commands: 
snap install ubuntu-app-platform
snap install --dangerous uitk-gallery_0.3_amd64.snap
snap connect uitk-gallery:platform ubuntu-app-platform:platform
uitk-gallery
 Note that the snaps must be connected before running uitk-gallery for the first time. If uitk-gallery has been executed before the snap connect you will see an error message. To fix the problem, uninstall the uitk-gallery snap, then re-install it and run the snap connect command before executing uitk-gallery. This is a known limitation in snapd which will be resolved soon. Another note: once support for the default-provider, already defined above, will correctly be implemented in snap, there will no longer be a need to install the platform snap separately - it will be pulled from the store automatically and the interface connects automatically. Evaluation We demonstrated three different approaches to creating a UITK gallery snap, which we gave the version numbers 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. For each of the approaches, the table below lists the time needed for the different stages of a snapcraft run, but the pull and build stages have been combined because when doing pull, some of the prerequisites need to be built already. The all stages row shows the total time when running the snapcraft command in a clean directory, so that all stages are executed sequentially, so the value is less than the sum of the previous rows in the table because in each stage it is not necessary to check completion of the previous stages. Version (bzr revision) 0.1 (r1) 0.2 (r2) 0.3 (r3) build (includes pull) 1m49s 1m48s 3.6s stage 7s 7s 1.5s prime 33s 34s 1.8s snap 1m11s 1m13s 1.7s all stages 3m32s 3m20s 4.0s install 2.2s 2.4s 1.2s snap file size 86 MB 86 MB 1.3 MB The measurements were done on a laptop with an Intel Core i5-6200U CPU with 8 GB RAM and an solid-state drive by running each command three times and listing the average execution time. All build-dependencies were pre-installed so their installation time is not included in the measurements. Note that this table only serves as an illustration, and execution times will vary greatly depending on your system configuration and internet connection, but it can easily be tested on your own hardware by bzr branching revisions r1, r2 and r3 of lp:~tpeeters/+junk/blog-snapping-qt-apps. The times and file size listed in the last column (version 0.3) do not include downloading and installing the ubuntu-app-platform snap, which is 135 MB (it includes more than just the minimal Qt and UITK dependencies of the UITK gallery). It can be seen that (depending on the internet connection speed, and which files were downloaded already), using the ubuntu-app-platform can speed up the pull and build time when creating a new snap file. However, the most important advantage is the reduction of the sum of the file sizes when installing multiple app snaps that all depend on Qt or other libraries that are part of the platform snap, because the libraries need to be installed only once. The disadvantage of this approach is that the app snap must be built using the exact same Qt (and other libraries) version as the ubuntu-app-platform snap, so the choice whether the snap should be fully self-contained or depend on the platform snap must be made individually for each use case. Future work The UITK gallery snap is not yet available in the Ubuntu store, so our next step will be to publish a UITK examples snap that includes the UITK gallery, and to set-up automatic publishing of that snap to different channels when we update the UITK or the examples. We will also evaluate what is the best way to make newer versions of Qt available and determine whether we need to provide prebuilt binaries to replace the qt57 and qt58 cloud parts. Finally, we will determine which libraries need to be included in the ubuntu-app-platform snap. The plan is to include all APIs that are listed on https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/ and if APIs are missing we will add them to that webpage as well as to the platform snap. Of course, if you think we are forgetting a library that is useful and used in many different applications, please leave a comment below.

As one of the founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, in 1957, and later, as the co-founder of one of the first venture capital investment firms, Kleiner truly was one of the people who turned America’s prune capital, Santa Clara County, into Silicon Valley.  Eugene Kleiner was born in Vienna, Austria, on May 12, 1923. His father, Leon Kleiner, was a shoe manufacturer, and his mother, the former Anna Wallach, ran a retail shoe business. Eugene was the youngest of their three children.   Within days of the Anschluss, the German occupation of Austria in March 1938, Jewish children were told to stop coming to school. Soon after that, Leon had his factories expropriated by the new Nazi government. Finally, in November 1938, soldiers appeared at the Kleiner home, confiscated the family’s valuables and arrested Leon. Flight to Belgium After his release from jail, Leon, who had for some time been sending money out of the country for a time it might be needed, realized that that time had come. The Kleiners left for Belgium, beginning an exodus that ended three years later in New York, in May 1941. During a stay of more than a year in Brussels, the son Eugene studied tool-and-die making at a vocational school set up by the Jewish community there. This served him in good stead once he was in the U.S., where he took work making parts for airplane landing gears before enlisting himself in the army, where his German-language skills were to put use in guarding German POWs. Post-war, Eugene studied engineering at what is now the Polytechnic University of New York, where an astute dean admitted him, even though Kleiner had never finished high school. Later, armed with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees, Kleiner went to work for Western Electric, where he built telephone relay equipment. In 1947, he married Rose Wassertheil, a social worker who also was a refugee from the Holocaust.   When, in 1956, Kleiner was approached by William Shockley to join a small team he was organizing to mass-produce the semiconductors he had helped invent, he accepted with alacrity and moved the family to Palo Alto, California. Working for Shockley, though, was a disaster, and it didn’t matter that the boss was joint winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics that same year. (Decades later, the same Shockley became notorious for his racialized views on human intelligence, and his embrace of eugenics.) Within a year, Kleiner and Shockley’s seven other initial engineering hires decided as a collective to leave his employ and set up their own shop. The historic marker at the Fairchild building at which the first commercially practical integrated circuit was invented.WikiCommons Enter the Space Race Fairchild Semiconductor, based on an initial investment of $1.5 million from entrepreneur Sherman Fairchild and another $3,500 scraped together by Kleiner and his colleagues, opened in October 1957, the same month that the USSR launched its Sputnik satellite, and the space race started in earnest. Overnight, there was a market for transistors, and it was Kleiner who developed the protocols and built the equipment for producing them. Within a year, Fairchild Semiconductor was in the black, with clients like IBM and the Pentagon. After three years Sherman Fairchild exercised an option to buy the firm in full for $3 million. When Kleiner and his partners each inevitably went out on their own, they went on to found companies like Intel, National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices. As Kleiner came to realize that he loved setting up new companies in new fields, he moved into venture capital work. A 1972 breakfast meeting led to a partnership with Hewlett Packard veteran Tom Perkins, and within a decade, Kleiner Perkins (today Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers) had turned an initial pool of $8 million into holdings worth $400 million, and included part-ownership of companies like Genentech and Tandem. For the frugal Kleiner, it wasn’t about the money. He continued to scour newspaper ads to learn when local drugstores would be selling Crest toothpaste at a discount. Rather, he loved the challenge of starting new businesses, particularly in fields, such as biotech, where the entrepreneurs were doing work never before attempted. David B.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Nov 19, 2016, 5:00pm EST share tweet Linkedin After two years of collaborating on self-driving cars, BMW and Chinese search giant Baidu have ended their partnership, according to multiple reports. Baidu is said to now be searching for a new automaker to team up with as it looks to ramp up its testing of autonomous vehicles in the US. Wang Jing, the head of autonomous car development at Baidu, told Reuters the company was now using cars from Ford's Lincoln in its US testing. "I'm open for any partners, actually I'm talking to many,” Wang said. “I'm open for any partners” Spokespersons for Baidu and BMW declined to comment, but a BMW executive told Reuters that the two companies differed on the direction of their research into autonomous vehicles. “"We now have found that the development pace and the ideas of the two companies are a little different," BMW's China CEO Olaf Kastner said. BMW has said it wants to bring a self-driving car to market by 2021. Baidu was more ambitious, aiming for 2018. There were other signs that the two companies weren’t entirely in lockstep. BMW had forged partnerships with other companies working on autonomous technology, including collision-avoidance detection firm Mobileye and chip-maker Intel. Other signs that the two companies weren’t entirely in lockstep. BMW and Baidu first began collaborating in 2014. At the time, Baidu senior vice president Wang Jin said that his company would launch of a new self-driving car with the German car manufacturer by the following year. The prototype vehicle would be used to test Baidu's autonomous technology, but would still have a human driver present. That vehicle never materialized. But earlier this year, Baidu received an autonomous vehicle testing permit from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, bringing the Chinese search giant one step closer to testing its self-driving cars on Google’s home turf. The Chinese search company has also been staffing up in Silicon Valley, building up a team of at least 100 engineers.

(聯發科) Taiwan's leading integrated circuit designer, is expected to see its sales for 2016 rise 29 percent from a year earlier, the second-highest growth among the top 20 IC firms in the world, according to market advisory firm IC Insights. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> In a statement posted on its website, IC Insights said that MediaTek has benefited from an increase in shipments to Chinese smartphone brands such as Oppo and Vivo, which has boosted its sales for this year. Smartphone chips account for about 60 percent of MediaTek's total revenue. As a result, IC Insights said, the company is expected to generate US$8.61 billion in sales in 2016, up 29 percent from a year earlier, and a growth rate trailing only a 35 percent increase expected for U.S.-based graphics IC designer Nvidia Corp. among the top 20 IC firms. Due to the strong sales growth, MediaTek is expected to become the 11th-largest IC company in the world in 2016, up two notches from a year earlier, while Nvidia is expected to rank as the 16th-largest, up from 18th, posting US$6.34 billion in sales, IC Insights said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (台積電), the largest contract chip maker in the world, could post US$29.32 billion in sales in 2016, up 11 percent from a year earlier, to retain the world No. 3 position, IC Insights said. The advisory firm said that United Microelectronics Corp. (聯電), the second-largest contract chip maker in Taiwan, is expected to post US$4.46 billion in sales in 2016, little changed from a year earlier, to remain the 20th-largest IC firm in the world. In 2016, the top 20 IC firms are expected to generate US$282.13 billion in sales, up about 3 percent from 2015, IC Insights said. U.S.-based Intel Corp. is expected to remain the largest IC firm in the world this year after posting US$56.31 billion in sales, up 8 percent from a year earlier, IC Insights said. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. is expected to come in second with an estimated US$43.54 billion in sales in 2016, up 4 percent from a year earlier, according to IC Insights. U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc. is expected to post US$15.44 billion in sales in 2016, down 4 percent from a year earlier, but its global ranking is expected to rise to fourth place, IC insights said.

In strident speeches and public comments, including a fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has aggressively argued that Islamic State militants pose a threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. In a June interview with CNN, Flynn complained the U.S. needs to “discredit” radical Islam, but that “we’re not allowed to do that right now.” But his comments about Islam, a religion practiced by more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, have at times gone beyond condemning radicals inside the faith. In Flynn’s book, “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies,” he condemned U.S. leaders who have called Islam a religion of peace. “This insistence on denying the existence of jihad led President Obama to the absurd claim that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam,” Flynn wrote. In August, he spoke at an event in Dallas hosted by the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam a “cancer” and a “political ideology” that “definitely hides behind being a religion.” Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group based in California, said in a statement that Flynn’s appointment “signals support for anti-Muslim policies and sentiment that will undermine our nation’s security and exacerbate an already unsafe climate for Muslims and all Americans.” The role of national security adviser has varied by administration, but usually centers on coordinating the policy positions of the secretaries of state, defense, justice and other members of a president’s national security team. It is an especially powerful position because of the national security adviser’s access to the president in the West Wing of the White House. The adviser acts as a gatekeeper on a wide range of issues, including matters of war and peace as well as diplomacy and intelligence. Flynn, who turns 58 in December, served for more than three decades in the Army following his commissioning in 1981 as a second lieutenant in military intelligence. His career included a stint as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and intelligence chief for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. It ended, however, when he was forced to resign from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 after two turbulent years leading the Pentagon’s top spy agency. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, a Russian government-controlled television channel. Flynn later explained that he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort. Flynn has became a harsh critic of the Obama administration’s prosecution of the fight against the Islamic State group and emerged as one of Trump’s most vocal backers. Throughout the campaign, Flynn championed many of Trump’s foreign policy provisions, including renegotiating a seven-country agreement with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. Yet while Flynn has publicly issued dark warnings about the risks of Islamic violence, his private consulting firm has lobbied for a company headed by a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey’s authoritarian, Islamist-leaning government, which cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup in July against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press on Friday that he had no relationship with Erdogan’s government, even though he is member of a Turkish foreign economic relations board managed by the country’s Economic Ministry. In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that Turkey needs support and echoed Erdogan’s warnings that a “shady” Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gullen, of orchestrating the July coup attempt and called for his extradition. The Obama administration has not complied. Alptekin said Friday that Flynn’s editorial supporting Erdogan was not connected to his company’s lobbying or the Turkish government. “The Turkish government did not order that,” he said. The Flynn Intel Group also lobbied Congress even as Flynn joined Trump in a presidential intelligence briefing in August — a possible security misstep, according to several ethics law experts. “If the general was receiving classified information that could affect his business interests, that would be an obvious concern,” said Joe Sandler, a campaign ethics lawyer and expert on the law that requires lobbyists for foreign governments to register their activities. Sandler and others also questioned why Flynn’s firm registered as lobbyists with Congress instead of the Justice Department’s stricter Foreign Agent unit, which requires more detailed reporting of activities under the federal Foreign Agent Registration Act. “If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress with the aim of influencing U.S policy, they’re required to file under the foreign agent act,” said Lydia Bennett, an expert in foreign agent work with the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight in Washington. Flynn’s consulting group registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin set up in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin said the lobbying project was designed to support an energy firm that he declined to identify. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group did not respond to calls and emails from the AP, and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn said in a statement Kelley provided to Yahoo News that if he returns to the government, “my relationship with my company will be severed.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » WIVB.com provides commenting to allow for constructive discussion on the stories we cover.

John Lewis is one of the biggest retail stores. So it makes sense that when Black Friday rolls around, John Lewis is going to get involved. The retail giant have everything on offer from new washing machines to PS4 bundles. They haven’t announced all of their Black Friday deals yet (we’ll update this post when they do), but some offers appear to have already started, so they’re definitely worth checking out. Important John Lewis Black Friday information: John Lewis will launch their Black Friday deals at midnight on Thursday November 24 Deals will continue being added across the weekend to match with those being offered by competitors Online deals will also be added on Cyber Monday – November 28 Never Knowingly Undersold: John Lewis’s price match guarantee means that if you find the same product cheaper somewhere else, they’ll give you a refund of the difference. This is pretty handy, so make sure to check all other stores’ Black Friday deals to see if you can get some money back.

Published Nov 19th, 2016 8:44 am ltbrannan@aol.com / @tbarkansas TV PREVIEW On this week’s TV edition of Talk Business & Politics, which airs Sundays at 9:30 a.m. on KATV Channel 7 in Central Arkansas and in Northeast Arkansas on KAIT-NBC, Sundays at 10 a.m.: A New Agenda Sen. Tom Cotton. He’s rumored for a position in the Trump administration, but the U.S. Senate has plenty of business ahead. Post-election, what are Cotton’s priorities? We’ll explore. The Aftermath Republicans and Democrats assess the aftermath of the big election. What stats stand out? And where do the two parties go from here? Chris Caldwell, campaign manager for Sen. John Boozman, and Democratic consultant Michael Cook are our guests. Inside the Numbers Plus, we’ll go inside the numbers for 3 numbers that mattered this week in business and politics. From Wal-Mart to Washington, D.C. Tune in to Talk Business & Politics in Central Arkansas on KATV Channel 7, Sundays at 9:30 a.m. and in Northeast Arkansas on KAIT-NBC, Sundays at 10 a.m. Coming in January 2017, Talk Business & Politics will air in Northwest Arkansas on KFSM Channel 5 at 10:30 a.m. following “Face the Nation.” THE 2017 FORTUNE CRYSTAL BALL Once again, Fortune has made its annual predictions from its “well-informed” staff “about the people, products, and trends that will matter in 2017.” The election of Donald Trump to the presidency represents a seismic shift in American politics, an event with implications nearly impossible to predict. One casualty of the election, indeed, may be the science of prediction itself: For all their algorithmic gymnastics, pollsters and betting markets were utterly confounded by Trump’s win. Which is why it’s essential to have a prediction tool that relies as much on art (and whimsy) as it does on science. “And this year, for some extra insight, we’ve even teamed up with artificial-intelligence powerhouse IBM Watson, which mined tens of millions of sources to help us spot hidden trends. Here, we offer our well-informed, intuitive take on the stories that will shape business — and much else — in the coming year.” Read on here. AMAZON WANTS TO BE YOUR HOUSEKEEPER In his annual letter to shareholders, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote, “We want Prime to be such a good value, you’d be irresponsible not to be a member,” posts Forbes. “To make good on that proposition, Amazon currently offers free two-day deliveries on over 30 million items, free same-day deliveries on hundreds of thousands of products, free video streaming of original series and other programming, free storage on the Amazon Cloud, the Kindle Lending Library, discounted rates on its new streaming music subscription services… The list goes on.” Now, according to reports, it appears as though Amazon plans to add housekeeping services as a perk for its Prime members. Read on at this link. HOW A NEW CEO CAN MAKE A FIRM MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL “A new face at the top brings new hopes, and often, new strategic priorities,” says Harvard Business Review. “When Target hired Brian Cornell as CEO in 2014, expectations were high that he would inject fresh energy into one of the largest U.S. retail chains. When that same year Microsoft replaced CEO Steve Ballmer with Satya Nadella, the move signaled the possibility for major change. Indeed, the company eventually announced its strategy to venture massively into cloud computing.” When new CEOs take charge, they sometimes change or even reverse the entire strategic course of the company – a course that, such as in the case of Microsoft, often aligns with entrepreneurial growth opportunities. Newly appointed CEOs might consider such an entrepreneurial focus attractive for various reasons. Following an entrepreneurial strategy ultimately means that managers and employees of a firm act more proactively and innovatively, and they take more risks — all which is known to drive growth and increase a firm’s advantage against competitors. “Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice shows that new CEOs indeed change a firm’s strategy and that this change tends to go into a more entrepreneurial direction. Interestingly, we found CEOs hired from the outside are more likely to change a firm’s strategy more drastically. However, insider CEOs are more likely to adopt new entrepreneurial strategies much sooner.” There are several reasons for the shift to more entrepreneurial strategies. Learn what they are by clicking here. THE MYTHS DEMOCRATS SWALLOWED THAT COST THEM THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION An editorial writer for The Scoop posts, “I have no problem with anyone who voted for Trump, because they wanted a Trump presidency. I have an enormous problem with anyone who voted for Trump or Stein or Johnson — or who didn’t vote at all — and who now expresses horror about the outcome of this election. If you don’t like the consequences of your own actions, shut the hell up.” The problem this election season has been that liberal Democrats — just like too many Republicans — have been consumed by provably false conspiracy theories. They have trafficked in them on Facebook and Twitter, they have read only websites that confirm what they want to believe, and they have, in the past few months, unknowingly gulped down Russian propaganda with delight. In other words, just like the conservatives they belittle, they have been inside a media bubble that blocked them from reality. So before proceeding, let’s address a few fantasies about this campaign: Here. TRUMP TEAM PLANNING SPECIAL VICTORY TOUR POLITICO posts, “President-elect Donald Trump will be embarking on a ‘victory tour’ to the states he carried, a campaign aide told reporters Thursday.” “We’re working on a victory tour now; it will happen in the next couple of weeks,” said George Gigicos, the campaign’s advance team director, who briefly talked about Trump’s first trip, according to pool reports. For more on this story, go to this link. THE DIVIDE BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTRY “The 2016 election exposed a chasm between urban and non-urban America that will likely widen under a Trump administration,” says The Atlantic. The earthquake that elected Donald Trump has left the United States approaching 2020 with a political landscape reminiscent of 1920. Not since then has the cultural chasm between urban and non-urban America shaped the struggle over the country’s direction as much as today. Of all the overlapping generational, racial, and educational divides that explained Trump’s stunning upset over Hillary Clinton last week, none proved more powerful than the distance between the Democrats’ continued dominance of the largest metropolitan areas, and the stampede toward the GOP almost everywhere else. “Trump’s victory was an empire-strikes-back moment for all the places and voters that feel left behind in an increasingly diverse, post-industrial, and urbanized America. Squeezing bigger margins from smaller places, Trump overcame a tide of resistance in the largest metropolitan areas that allowed Clinton to carry the national popular vote, but not the decisive Electoral College.” “This election thus carved a divide between cities and non-metropolitan areas as stark as American politics has produced since the years just before and after 1920. That year marked a turning point: It was the first time the Census recorded that more people lived in urban than non-urban areas. That tangible sense of shifting influence triggered a series of political and social conflicts between big cities teeming with immigrants, many of them Catholic, and small towns and rural communities that remained far more homogeneously, white, native-born, and Protestant.” For the complete post, follow this link. THE FIREWORKS OF THE FUTURE “In the 18 minutes it takes to blow up 30-some tons of fireworks for the Fourth of July show on the National Mall in D.C., it costs the government more than 200 grand. Bigger shows—like the massive Macy’s show in New York City—can cost millions,” reports Fast Company. “Fireworks also make local air pollution spike, and can pollute water and soil when chemicals and heavy metals shower down from the pyrotechnics.” But everyone likes a show. So Intel is attempting to pioneer an alternative that’s just as mesmerizing to watch: hundreds of drones, choreographed into a spectacular light display. The company first tested the idea in 2015, in an experiment with 100 manually programmed drones. Now they’ve unveiled a new drone, called the Shooting Star, designed for light shows. An algorithm automatically programs the drones to fly in formation, and a single pilot can run the display. Prepare to be amazed here. MUSK SAYS TELSA’S SOLAR SHINGLES WILL COST LESS THAN A DUMB ROOF Bloomberg reports, “It’s official: After Tesla shareholders approved the acquisition of SolarCity, the new company is now an unequivocal sun-to-vehicle energy firm. And Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk didn’t take long to make his first big announcement as head of this new enterprise.” Minutes after shareholders approved the deal — about 85 percent of them voted yes — Musk told the crowd that he had just returned from a meeting with his new solar engineering team. Tesla’s new solar roof product, he proclaimed, will actually cost less to manufacture and install than a traditional roof—even before savings from the power bill. “Electricity,” Musk said, “is just a bonus.” “If Musk’s claims prove true, this could be a real turning point in the evolution of solar power. The rooftop shingles he unveiled just a few weeks ago are something to behold: They’re made of textured glass and are virtually indistinguishable from high-end roofing products. They also transform light into power for your home and your electric car.” More on this incredible new Telsa rooftop at this link. AN ENTIRE MBA INTO ONE ONLINE COURSE Business Insider says, “If your’e looking to sharpen your finance knowledge before diving in, Udemy is currently offering a course just for you. Chris Haroun has guest lectured and advised at McGill and Columbia Universities, respectively, worked a Goldman Sachs, and authored “101 Crucial Lessons They Don’t Teach You in Business School,” which was recently named by Forbes magazine as “1 of 6 books that all entrepreneurs need to read right now”.” Haroun has taken lessons he’s taught at universities in the past and condensed them into one course that he describes as “an entire MBA.” “Through the class students will learn macro and micro economics, how to value companies, and the basics of how investment banks and management consulting firms work. In addition to the nuts and bolts, Haroun aims to teach his students about the importance of personal connections and professional presentation: how to identify and pitch venture capitalists and communicate your ideas clearly and concisely. And talk about a Black Friday deal. You’ll be amazed at how much this course costs. But you’d better hurry. Course details at this link.

Which means the people you hire – particularly if they're ideologues – can profoundly shape the way you govern more than 300 million lives. Give Chris Christie this much: He had tried to appoint a few competent and experienced public servants to Donald Trump's transition team, such as former Rep. Mike Rogers, the former House Intelligence Committee chairman who was tapped to lead the national security unit for the incoming administration. But Rogers was forced out in the internecine war, and numerous reports say he has been replaced by Frank Gaffney, who seems to have turned anti-Muslim fearmongering into a full-time job since he was run out of the Reagan Administration. Consider Gaffney's greatest hits. The birther movement? Gaffney got there first. He was the first to write during the 2008 campaign that President Obama is a secret Muslim who wasn't born in the U.S., and that Muslims backed his candidacy financially. He said there's a deep-rooted Muslim infiltration of the U.S. government, and that two Muslim congressmen should be banned from the House Intel Committee Intelligence because they would leak info to the Muslim Brotherhood. Republicans aren't immune: Gaffney accused Grover Norquist, the anti-tax zealot, of ties to Islamic infiltrators; suggested that Gen. David Petraeus was submitting to Sharia for condemning a Koran burning; and he accused Christie of treason for appointing Muslim judge Sohail Mohammed to Superior Court. And most dangerously, a survey from Gaffney's group – the Center for Security Policy – is cited as the centerpiece of Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country. Trump once suggested that he could compensate for his lack of government experience by hiring "the best people" to guide him through the steps. But instead his policy is being shaped by a lunatic conspiracy theorist whom the Southern Poverty Law Center calls "one of America's most dangerous Islamaphobes." That's your new democracy, America.

Miller November 18, 2016 10 Comments IoT promises to be more than just what we see today; new examples appeared at Techonomy as the debate over the devices continued. The many different applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), the new business models that IoT enables, and the issues involved in securing and regulating these were a big topic at last week's Techonomy 2016 conference. I was particularly interested in hearing about several new examples of IoT uses and more concrete ideas regarding regulations and security. The Vast Internet of Things One interesting panel covered some of the more unusual projects that are now being considered as part of the Internet of Things. Sara Gardner of Hitachi Insight Group (above, second from the left) discussed using IOT to automate factories, to help companies move from selling products to offering services, and for improving "social infrastructure" like transportation and energy. Gardner discussed using IoT devices to improve safety in places like mines, where remote operation might help keep people safe, and things such as facial recognition on cows in agriculture, to improve herd management. Eric Topol of the Scripps Research Institute (third from left) talked about "digitizing our bodies" using information taken from electrocardiograms, and devices to monitor conditions such as sleep apnea and ear infections. The goal is to anticipate problems before they occur, furthering preventative care. Usually, Topol said, this happens with wearables, not through sensors embedded in the body, though in some cases—such as preventing heart attacks—embedded devices may prove necessary. Topol said the concept of the hospital as we know it today will change. Instead of waiting weeks to get an appointment with a primary care physician, he anticipates future doctor visits will often involve video chats and data exchange, possibly supplemented by a doctor visiting you. People should only have to go to a hospital for very specific procedures, like surgery. One issue, he said, is that a patient needs to own his or her data. Topol said that right now everyone has that data except for the patient; this situation has to change. "Medical technology will completely reboot healthcare," he said. Tom Barton of Planet Labs (far left) talked about the company's goal of imaging all of the land area of the planet at least once a day using consumer electronics in order to build much smaller, much less costly satellites. Barton said the company has already launched fifty satellites and plans to launch another hundred. Most of the company's customers today are in agriculture and government, and he described applications ranging from land use categorization and tracking deforestation to improving agricultural yield management and the size of the global food supply. Smart Cities and Smart Seas (Gaudette and Regas) Another panel discussed the concept of "smart cities" and how this is much more complicated than it is often portrayed. Martin Powell of the Siemens Global Cities Centre of Competence discussed how using data to create "smart cities" might have different impacts than you would expect, such as how banning bikes in London would actually reduce pollution. Mrinalini Ingram of Verizon talked about how citizens are now able to play a larger part in the process of managing cities. Moderator Gary Bolles mentioned that so many people use Waze in L.A. that residents in some newly-trafficked zones are complaining or trying to feed the app false information. Powell said that generally you can't give citizens planning decisions, but you do need to take data, aggregate it, and control it at the municipal level. Assaf Biderman of MIT's SENSEable City Lab said citizens need to feel a sense of ownership of data, though some things can't be voted on. He also said that many offerings won't come from the cities themselves but will instead come from the outside. A panel on "smart shipping" talked about bringing IoT concepts to shipping, with moderator Simone Ross noting that despite 90 percent of global trade moving on the oceans, this is a "data dead zone." Peter Platzer of Spire Global talked about his company's plans to use small satellites to traverse the ocean three or four times an hour instead of only a few times a day, while Anthony DiMare of Nautilus Labs discussed his firm's plans to bring big data analytics to the shipping industry, asserting that Nautilus could use data and analytics to reduce fuel usage by as much as 30 percent. John Kao of maritime security firm Thayer Mahan discussed the problem of visualization from the top of the ocean down, saying that this issue has important implications for mining, fishing, and geopolitical affairs. Platzer noted that there is currently $10 billion in annual piracy on the seas, and said 80 percent of the time we don't know exactly where the ships are. Kao agreed with others that there are few laws and no overarching framework on maritime security, and talked about how we have little monitoring of undersea cables or ports. All of the panelists agreed that in the years to come we must develop the ability to know more about the location of ships on the ocean, as well as what the conditions are underwater. Another area covered was the power grid, and using IoT to combat climate change. Robert Gaudette of independent power provider NRG Energy said that IoT creates a whole lot of demand for energy, but also help us to manage the load on the grid. Diane Regas of the Environmental Defense Fund said that some countries have now gone up to four days using only renewable energy, but agreed that IoT could open up new energy solutions, including allowing people to adjust both the demand side of energy as well as energy production. She addressed the issue of incentives for the utility companies and said this must change from utilities being rewarded in terms of how they invest, to the utilities being rewarded by performance, which would include how much they lower emissions. Medical Applications (Tas and Tyson) Perhaps the sector most ripe for change is health care. "We have a real opportunity to transform the health care system in this country, and indeed the world," Kaiser Permanente CEO Bernard Tyson said. In the past year the majority of Kaiser interactions with patients took place using a "care anywhere" model; a secure "e-visit" over a phone, tablet, or PC, instead of a patient going to the hospital. Tyson explained that Kaiser is a fully integrated system—it brings together insurance coverage and health care—and that this model is designed to facilitate prevention, early detection, and early treatment. Philips CEO Jeroen Tas said that 80 percent of the cost of health care today is related to chronic disease, which is often influenced by social factors as well as personal choice. Today health care is reimbursed around acute events, but it should instead be covered based on the outcome. "If you pay for sickness, you get sickness; if you pay for health, you get health," Tas said. Tas suggested we need a new way of delivering care, and that much of it will no longer take place in a hospital. Instead, friends and families could be part of a new way of organizing care. He mentioned that the UK's National Health System now has 1.5 million volunteers to assist with care. Both men agreed that you can reduce health care costs, but only if you reimburse on outcomes, not on care, with Tyson noting that Kaiser doesn't get more money by having more patients in its hospitals. Tyson noted that medical devices can augment humans, in terms of helping to make early detection available before a problem develops. As examples he mentioned warning about dehydration, measuring blood sugar in people with diabetes, and simply checking to determine if medications are being reordered properly, which gives an indication that they are being taken. (There was a suggestion that half of all medication is not actually consumed.) Tas suggested that AI will play a bigger role in making sure the trail of diagnosis, treatment, and medication prescribed stays within the patient record, making it easier for doctors, patients, and clinicians to easily access pertinent information. He is seeing a lot of progress in this area, and in a couple of years, the systems will often support decision-making. The Role of Government In a separate conversation on IoT and the U.S government, Intel president Murthy Renduchintala envisioned an environment that fuses together computing, pervasive and ambient communications, and advanced machine learning. He talked about computing and intelligence at the edge of such an environment being able to contribute information to a central data repository and then receive aggregated information after it is processed. Overall, he said, the U.S. does a good job of gathering information, but many other countries have a head start in areas like regulation for self-driving cars, or smart cities. In technology, the U.S. is doing a phenomenal job, but "in terms of harnessing technology, we've got some catching up to do." Renduchintala said areas such as autonomous driving, robots, and drones seem to demand some degree of legislative involvement, and talked about possibilities as to when such systems may go mainstream. He talked about three main areas where the government could get involved: basic legislation, or understanding what is happening and how the government can be catalyzing technology to move forward; a national R&D strategy, which is about making sure everyone is playing in the same sandbox, and especially in areas like autonomous driving and drone regulation; and finally, the government must play a key role when it comes to security, noting this isn't just about the end device, but also about protecting information as it is transferred over very large networks. Renduchintala said there is a burden on industry to better educate everyone concerned, including Congress. He expects to see an economic benefit from IoT, particularly in areas such as autonomous cars, because people spend a lot of time in traffic jams that could be better harnessed in productive areas. GE and "Productivity of Things" GE Digital's Bill Ruh (right) talked GE's digital transformation. We are moving from a world where owning an asset is the value to one where the data and services around the asset are becoming more important. A few years ago, he said, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt could see that the combination of data, AI, and statistics coming together could make assets more efficient and that a company that could figure out how to best maintain and use the assets had the potential to disrupt GE. So, the company decided to get out in front of this transformation. Over the next three to five years, every industrial company will go through this transition. "If they don't, someone else will," Ruh said. Ruh discussed GE's "digital twin" concept and said that while AI is great, it only addresses part of the problem unless you know the details of the actual physical device. Instead, the company combines modeling and AI to run simulations—starting with digital twins for wind farms, and then moving into other areas such as power plants and rail networks, with systems designed to figure out the order in which to move trains within a system. Many of these decisions were not intuitive, he said. Overall, Ruh said, the most important takeaway has been the "productivity of things," and said the three sexiest words in the industrial world are "zero unplanned downtime." Ruh said he worries about trade policies and data sovereignty, but that in the end, it's a job issue. He noted that we have seen slower GDP growth and an increase in automation that has in turn driven down lower-skill jobs. Ruh said that while automation will happen, we may see a shift from labor arbitrage automation to local content, with more manufacturing moving local, in part due to things such as additive manufacturing (3D printing). "We don't know how it will play out," he said. Ruh did say that regulation will be needed, but that it needs to be smart and not unintentionally block innovation. Securing the Internet of Things (Bartolomeo, Cooper, Eagan, Rill, Higginbotham) Stacey Higginbotham of the Internet of Things Podcast moderated a session on IoT security and pointed to things like the recent Mirai botnet, which used millions of old connected webcams to produce a recent distributed denial-of-service attack that left many websites unreachable for some time. Mark Bartolomeo, VP of Internet of Things M2M Connected Solutions at Verizon, agreed that security is a huge problem, but said it is a problem we're solving. Bartolomeo pushed for more security standards for devices but said we also need network security, host and IT security, and better employee training. He said security is "a problem we'll never stop working on," pointing to Verizon's recent study of 100,000 breaches. (Later, I had a good conversation with him about how quickly Verizon expects IoT to grow as connectivity prices decline, and also about the complexity of deploying such systems today and the need for better security.) Betsy Cooper, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, said we cannot fully be secure. Her group works on many possible scenarios. There is always a risk of a small degree of failure, she said. Darktrace CEO Nicole Eagan said there is no perimeter anymore, and agreed that if you have a sophisticated threat actor, they will get in. Instead, Eagan said, it is important to have visibility into devices to see what is going on and react accordingly. To that end, her firm's product emulates the human immune system. Chris Rill, co-founder and CTO at Canary, which makes a wireless home security product, said one big question is who you are trying to protect yourself from. Protecting systems from "script kiddies" is possible, he said, but defending against government actors is much harder. Rill said some companies like his really care about security, while others just treat it as a checkbox feature. While he hopes that in the future security will help drive demand for particular products, he admitted that consumers generally don't ask for the most secure products. The panel discussed various ways of making sure devices are secured, with a number pointing to ICSA certification in multiple layers of devices. Rill talked about how Canary specifically doesn't open more ports than necessary, while Eagan talked about how connectivity concerns have led many devices, including most video conferencing systems and even nuclear power plants, to be vulnerable to specific attacks. She said if you can watch network traffic, you can detect anomalous behaviors early before damage is done, and that the next step will be "algorithm vs. algorithm," particularly as nation-states start tapping into math experts to create their own AIs. Regulation was also a big topic, with Cooper decrying the "balkanization of cybersecurity regulation." Cooper said we need to get the right players in the same room, and suggested that the person in charge of cybersecurity at the White House should have elevated responsibilities. Eagan noted that lots of devices are not actually created in the U.S., and Rill talked about some of the steps Canary has taken to ensure it knew every component that goes into its product during their manufacture in China.

In strident speeches and public comments, including a fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has aggressively argued that Islamic State militants pose a threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. In a June interview with CNN, Flynn complained the U.S. needs to "discredit" radical Islam, but that "we're not allowed to do that right now." But his comments about Islam, a religion practiced by more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, have at times gone beyond condemning radicals inside the faith. Retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn gestures as he arrives at Trump Tower, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) In Flynn's book, "The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies," he condemned U.S. leaders who have called Islam a religion of peace. "This insistence on denying the existence of jihad led President Obama to the absurd claim that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam," Flynn wrote. In August, he spoke at an event in Dallas hosted by the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam a "cancer" and a "political ideology" that "definitely hides behind being a religion." Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group based in California, said in a statement that Flynn's appointment "signals support for anti-Muslim policies and sentiment that will undermine our nation's security and exacerbate an already unsafe climate for Muslims and all Americans." The role of national security adviser has varied by administration, but usually centers on coordinating the policy positions of the secretaries of state, defense, justice and other members of a president's national security team. It is an especially powerful position because of the national security adviser's access to the president in the West Wing of the White House. The adviser acts as a gatekeeper on a wide range of issues, including matters of war and peace as well as diplomacy and intelligence. Flynn, who turns 58 in December, served for more than three decades in the Army following his commissioning in 1981 as a second lieutenant in military intelligence. His career included a stint as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and intelligence chief for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. It ended, however, when he was forced to resign from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 after two turbulent years leading the Pentagon's top spy agency. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, a Russian government-controlled television channel. Flynn later explained that he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort. Flynn has became a harsh critic of the Obama administration's prosecution of the fight against the Islamic State group and emerged as one of Trump's most vocal backers. Throughout the campaign, Flynn championed many of Trump's foreign policy provisions, including renegotiating a seven-country agreement with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. Yet while Flynn has publicly issued dark warnings about the risks of Islamic violence, his private consulting firm has lobbied for a company headed by a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's authoritarian, Islamist-leaning government, which cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup in July against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press on Friday that he had no relationship with Erdogan's government, even though he is member of a Turkish foreign economic relations board managed by the country's Economic Ministry. In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that Turkey needs support and echoed Erdogan's warnings that a "shady" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gullen, of orchestrating the July coup attempt and called for his extradition. The Obama administration has not complied. Alptekin said Friday that Flynn's editorial supporting Erdogan was not connected to his company's lobbying or the Turkish government. "The Turkish government did not order that," he said. The Flynn Intel Group also lobbied Congress even as Flynn joined Trump in a presidential intelligence briefing in August — a possible security misstep, according to several ethics law experts. "If the general was receiving classified information that could affect his business interests, that would be an obvious concern," said Joe Sandler, a campaign ethics lawyer and expert on the law that requires lobbyists for foreign governments to register their activities. Sandler and others also questioned why Flynn's firm registered as lobbyists with Congress instead of the Justice Department's stricter Foreign Agent unit, which requires more detailed reporting of activities under the federal Foreign Agent Registration Act. "If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress with the aim of influencing U.S policy, they're required to file under the foreign agent act," said Lydia Bennett, an expert in foreign agent work with the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight in Washington. Flynn's consulting group registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin set up in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin said the lobbying project was designed to support an energy firm that he declined to identify. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group did not respond to calls and emails from the AP, and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn said in a statement Kelley provided to Yahoo News that if he returns to the government, "my relationship with my company will be severed."

Creative Commons Zero This year at LinuxCon North America in Toronto, The Linux Foundation partnered with MakerKids and Kids on Computers to organize a day-long event focused on getting school-aged children interested in learning more about computer programming. The Kids Day workshops included projects around Linux, Arduino, robots, and more. “Kids on Computers has participated at SCALE and OSCON in years past, but this was our first time at LinuxCon. We do lot of hands-on training with students, teachers, and communities where we install computer labs (we have 12 in Mexico!), but this was our very first conference-based workshop. We are excited to see our Linux Foundation partnership grow and very much appreciated the opportunity to be at LinuxCon and conduct this workshop,” said  Avni Khatri, President of Kids on Computers. Kid’s talk: The future is open I talked to some of the children and their parents participating in the event. Here, I am using only their first names to protect their privacy. “It was a great opportunity for me to bring my daughter to work and expose her a little with what I do. It’s an excellent workshop that the Linux Foundation has come up along with LinuxCon,” said Bryan, an engineer with EMC. His 9-year-old daughter, Adele, said that she has been using a computer forever. And she uses Linux, specifically Gentoo Linux. She uses it for playing games, researching for school, and for finding games, she told me. Adele and her dad also enjoy playing games that involve some coding. Bryan said that, in his opinion, you should expose your kids to all kinds of things and find out what they like, and as soon as they can read, allow them to program or type on the keyboard. And if they like it, they like it. Adele was certainly excited about the workshop and said she had a lot fun. Sean was also attending the event and brought his two kids, Matthias (11) and Naomi (13). Matthias uses his computer at home to play games, and he has done some programming in the school library and has participated in the Hour Of Code program. Naomi is a Chromebook and Android user and has done the Genius Hour program. Compared to her brother, she was much more excited about the workshop. Sean said that he brought his children so they could enjoy the wider world of Linux and open source ecosystem and see what the nature of collaboration development is all about. He added that during the workshop, they would mostly be doing very basic, low-level stuff and get initial exposure to Linux. “I am hoping they will have some fun with Arduino and some of the whole maker culture stuff,” said Sean. Kaden is 11 and uses a computer at home to do research for school projects and to play games. He hasn’t done any programming yet, but he came to the workshop to learn more about computers and learn how they work. His dad is a software engineer at IBM, who saw a great opportunity in bringing his son to the event. However, he doesn’t believe in pushing his son to learn anything about computers. “I think it’s a natural thing because he already has a lot of video games at home, so it’s up to him how he likes the programming and Linux or open source. All these concepts are new to him, so we will see.” Khatri said 13 kids registered and 19 kids showed up for the workshop. “It was exciting to see so much enthusiasm around LinuxCon's first ever Kids Day, the workshop, and to see kids with engaged parents and older siblings working on the workshop activities,” said Khatri. It’s not child’s play It was a busy day for children. During the workshop kids learned how to do a Linux install where they tried Ubermix that’s a fork of Ubuntu with a turn-key 5 minute installation. They also learned how to install software on Linux using Arduino IDE + Ardublock in preparation for the afternoon workshop with MakerKids. Graham from MakerKids brought over the Arduinos in the morning so the kids could test them. The children also learned about networking. Tim Moody of Unleash Kids brought an Intel NUC with Internet in a Box (IIAB) installed and taught this portion. “The kids connected to the IIAB access point, accessed content and then used the local network to ping each other, SSH into each other's machines and SCP files,” said Khatri. The children also did some scratch programming where they learned to use Scratch (for beginners) and write their name (for folks who already knew how to use Scratch). According to Khatri, “The participants who attended the workshop were much more experienced than the kids we usually work with in Kids on Computers. They knew how to use a computer and some of them had used Scratch before as well. From what I could tell, none of them had installed Linux on a computer before or were very familiar with networking. Many were also new to Arduino and Arduino programming.” Do we need such workshops? These days kids are exposed to computers at a very early age. That’s a good and bad situation. It’s good in the sense that the next generation is getting comfortable with technologies that will be at the core of their lives, but most of these products are dumbed down closed source technologies that erect a wall between how things work and curious minds, locking them out of the immense knowledge of how things work. Thus, projects like Kids on Computers become even more important: These efforts can transform kids from consumers to creators. “Many kids today have access to an immense amount of technology and we hope our efforts will help them begin their journey to create their own products and building upon technology they use,” said Khatri. “I feel like this workshop was on opportunity for the participants to learn what an Operating System is, how to install an OS, and learn a little bit about programming and networking. We also discussed free and open source software (FOSS) with the participants, how GNU/Linux is FOSS, and I hope something they began to understand from the workshop is the flexibility and power provided when code is easily accessible and modifiable.” In the end, it turned out to be a really exciting experience. Khatri said the feedback from parents and kids was extremely positive. The parents were excited about what the kids were learning. “I especially loved seeing the kids' reactions as we taught them how to use SSH and they were able to connect to each other's machines and send messages over a local network we had in the room,” said Khatri. That is kind of future we need, where we have complete access to the technologies that we use, and organizations like Kids on Computers and MakerKids help lay the foundation for that future. Let’s build a generation of dreamers and creators.

What do you do when your career in the corporate world is disrupted? What is life after retirement? I retired at age 39 after 18 years of corporate life in one of the largest companies in Southeast Asia. People who heard about it said I was too young to retire. I told them I didn’t retire. I "re-tired," that is--I changed tires. Susan Romero Vidal It was time for me to go to the pit stop and choose which tires to take for the next season of my life--assuming I live until I am 80 years old. And boy, what a journey it has been. I was in my Mt. Everest of corporate life when God called me to do mission work for the youth through Bigkis Young Life Foundation. It was on my bucket list. While I had allowance from the ministry, I used my retirement pay for our daily bread. My husband went into business but it did not work out. During my time of discernment, I took a workshop on the Power of Personal purpose with Trinidad Hunt in Kona, Hawaii. A few hours before I boarded my plane back home, I took a helicopter ride in Oahu Island which hovered for a minute at the thick forest of the Sacred Falls where the movie Jurassic Park was shot. There, I felt God whispered to me: “Do not worry. Look at the abundance of this forest. No one takes care of it but Me. You are my beloved.” On the last working day of December 1999, I signed off from my corporate life. I remember running the head of the pen on the walls of my cubicle as I was whispering "freedom" like in the movie Braveheart. The verse of Jeremiah 29:11 came ringing in my ears: "For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” I imagined myself catching the trapeze that God swung to me in my Mt. Everest as I said "yes" to the mission when all my children were in grade school and my husband had yet to establish his business again. As I let go of the trapeze, God caught me with his magic carpet and like Aladdin, I saw a whole new world of the youth who have a lot of talent and potential and yet wanting of role models. Along with fellow adult leaders, I devoted my time and talent hanging out with the youth in the school or parishes sharing with them who Jesus Christ is and how much he loves and cares for us. We conducted retreats, leadership trainings and youth camps. On the home front, I shed off my corporate power dressing and found myself domesticated with household chores as soon as we repatriated from Hong Kong. In the ordinariness of the kitchen sink, I felt God’s presence telling me to write my book. For 10 years prior to that fateful morning, I nurtured this dream to become an inspirational author and speaker as there are so many miracles in our family life that have to be shared. In between my mission work, I wrote, self-published and launched in 90 days my very first book, The Gospel According to my Kitchen Sink. Little did I know that God had other plans for me. And that is to be a book coach. Many who read my book were inspired and shared they wanted to write their life story. One of them, Josette Biyo, was a public school teacher who won the Intel Teaching Excellence Award in Kentucky, US. She has a planet named after her. She wrote and launched her storybook, A Trip to Planet Biyo, in 72 days. At first she shared with me that she had been asked to write her storybook but did not have the time. I asked her, “Dr. Biyo, send me one story a day, just one story.” In 30 days, she sent me 30 stories that completed her book. She was an obedient student. No wonder, she was a great teacher. “My grammar sucks!” This was Fil-Canadian Juliet Van Ruyven’s repartee with Mark Victor Hansen, author of Chicken Soup for the Soul, when the latter told her, “You have a book in you, write it.” When she went home to the Philippines, Juliet used the Law of Attraction and Intention to meet a Filipina author who can help write her book. Our common friend, Msgr. Antonio Unson gifted her with a number of books including my Kitchen Sink storybook. Awake in the wee hours due to jetlag, she singled out and read my book from cover to cover. Two days after, the three of us were together having breakfast. Ten minutes into my sharing how I wrote my book, Juliet said, “I will send you the ticket to Canada and help me write my book.” Juliet was true to her word. Three months after, she sent me the ticket to Canada. She also sponsored me to Harv Eker’s Millionaire Mind seminar. In August 2005, Juliet Van Ruyven launched her book entitled The Tale of Juliet. By January 2006, she was one of the awardees for “People of the Year” by Starweek Magazine and her book became an Amazon bestseller. The success of my new friend Juliet made me remember a dear friend whose life story is so awe inspiring. I wrote my friend, “If Juliet has inspired millions of people, you can do the same with your story. Write your storybook.” She started writing and sending her stories to me and then complete silence. I jokingly threatened her to pay me $100 if she did not send me her stories. Unknown to me, she had a writer’s block when she had to write the most painful and traumatic experience of her life. Until one day, she surprised when she told me she already wrote her story book in 40 days. Her daughter sent her a note with Rick Warren’s famous quote from Purpose Driven Life: “Other people are going to find healing in your wounds. Your greatest life messages and your most effective ministry will come out of your deepest hurts.” This is Imelda Roberts, author of Barefooted Soul. With her life story, she became the first Filipina to receive the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for Life Achievement. Among her co-recipients are US presidents, senators and other personalities in sports, arts and culture among others. Today, she is living her dream through her Blue Dreams farm in Frederick, Maryland. To date, there are four more authors who found inspiration in that little "kitchen sink gospel" book and propelled them to write their own storybook. On my part, I have written three more inspirational books since 2000 and have gone to the pit stop to change tires and take on other business I never thought I would get into. When we view retirement as going to the pit stop of life to change tires, then life becomes more exciting and fulfilling.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reddit LinkedIn Email Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK — Donald Trump's  unconventional campaign transitions to the unconventional transition team. So, hold onto your seats! First off, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been named Trump's pick for attorney general. He was once Alamaba's AG. Looks like Sessions' loyalty is paying off. He was the first U.S. senator to  endorse Trump. Senator Ted Cruz stated that Sessions is "great news for all of us who revere the Constitution and the rule of law. " But critics point out that 30 years ago, a senate judiciary committee rejected Sessions for a federal judge appointment because of  allegations of racism. A black assistant U.S. attorney who worked for Sessions testified that Sessions called him "boy." "I am not a racist," Session fervently told the Senate Judiciary Committee at his 1986 confirmation hearing. "I am not insensitive to Blacks. I have supported civil rights activity in my state." So, will Sessions face deja-vu  in the senate all over again? "We've got a great number of men and women with great qualifications come forward to serve this new administration," Vice-President-elect Mike Pence reassured reporters at Trump Tower. Another Trump pick is Congressman Mike Pompeo of Kansas for  CIA Director. Pompeo is a former military serviceman and  was a top grad at West Point.  Trump says the congressman  has "spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens." He had a bitter clash with Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. Next up, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as Trump's Assistant for National Security Affairs. Flynn was a former military adviser to President Obama. He also owns a lobbyist company called Flynn Intel Group, which reportedly received tens of thousands of dollars from a Turkish client. So, is Flynn really going to 'drain the swamp?' Some say he will have to cut ties with his own company to keep from blurring the lines. And speaking of blurred lines, during Trump's first official meeting with a foreign official...  daughter Ivanka is pictured sitting in on the high-level discussion with the Japanese prime minister on Thursday. "I've said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues," Ivanka told '60 Minutes' last Sunday. "So, there are a lot of things that I feel very strongly about, but not in a formal, administrative capacity." Maybe she just wanted to be a fly-on-the-wall for the Japanese prime minister's meeting, then? Apart from arch rival Mitt Romney meeting with Trump to discuss the secretary of state job this weekend.

Featured Story: Windows Holographic Lands in Windows 10 Insider Build 14971 HoloLens: Know-how for Microsoft's HoloLens & other AR/VR tools. — Next Reality News: Windows Holographic Lands in Windows 10 Insider Build 14971 Bryan Crow yesterday Windows Holographic Lands in Windows 10 Insider Build 14971 Windows Insiders running Build 14971 of Windows 10 in the Fast Ring can now look for the "Windows Holographic First Run" app to check to see if their PCs are up to the task of running Windows Holographic. It won't detect your VR headset yet, but at least you'll be able to see if your computer will be compatible. For the unfamiliar, Windows Holographic is the 3D shell that the HoloLens runs, made available to all Windows 10 devices by connecting a compatible virtual reality headset. Instead of the full mixed reality experience you can have with a HoloLens, you'll experience the same environment in a virtual space that you can customize for yourself. Don't Miss: HoloLens Dev 101: How to Get Started Creating for Windows Holographic With the latest build of Windows 10, Microsoft has quietly given insider's their first look at Windows Holographic. Just look for the iconless "Windows Holographic First Run" app in the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview. You'll immediately see the initial minimum requirements check. Compared to VR gaming, Windows Holographic has fairly reasonable system requirements: 4 GB Memory USB 3.0 A DirectX 12 Compatible GPU 4 CPU Cores (Though, my dual-core 6th gen. Intel CPU with Hyperthreading support—which shows up as 4 cores in Task Manager—passed this test just fine.) Afterward, you'll be able to prepare your room and set up your headset. However, as the first run app is still in development, so it won't actually detect any VR headsets just yet. Hopefully this will start working in next week's build. If you have an HTC Vive and are already in the Windows Insider program, you're one step closer to using Windows Holographic. If not, you can join the Windows Insider Program, though it may take a day or two after joining the Fast Ring for you to be able to download the latest build of Windows 10. If you don't have a VR headset, or don't want to spend $700 on a Vive, new Windows Holographic headsets will be launching early next year for around $300. For those who would rather not run beta builds of Windows 10 (which can be buggy), Windows Holographic will be launching around March of 2017 for free as part of the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. Be sure to check back as we'll be taking a deeper look into Windows Holographic soon.

This is part of an aggressive workforce diversity and inclusion initiative being introduced by Satya Nadella.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement Microsoft thinks it is failing on workforce diversity year on year. In a bid to change this narrative, the company is now mulling to tie executive bonuses to employee diversity goals. Satya Nadella's Plan Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, is leading the initiative himself. He was reportedly the one who introduced the plan, which involves the use of diversity goals as factors in determining whether executives would get their full bonuses every year. "Diversity and inclusion is something you've got to ingrain; you've got to keep talking about the business value; you've got to keep talking about the impact," Gwen Houston, general manager for Global Diversity and Inclusion at Microsoft, told Bloomberg. "That's what Satya has been doing." Female Decline At Microsoft Despite the fact that a significant number of Microsoft's top leadership positions are occupied by women, the overall female population within the organization now constitutes 25 percent, falling one percentage point from the figure posted last year. The decline of the female employee population is largely attributed to the shutdown of Microsoft's Nokia division, which the company is phrasing as a streamlining strategy. But the shutdown entailed the layoff of a huge chunk of female and minority employees. Organizational Diversity Goals Existing hiring policies are already guided by overarching diversity goals. These have been credited for a slight shift in the organizational diversity. This is purportedly driven by an increase in female, African-American and Hispanic recruits. However, their collective number did not make any dent on the declining trend. Nadella seems unhappy about Microsoft's inclusion strategy. Observers are watching the debut of his new policy closely because Microsoft is expected to march to its tune with alacrity. Nadella has already supported key policies in the past that are aligned with diversity and inclusion. He has been an enthusiastic supporter of an internship program called Explorer, which is part of a hiring strategy spearheaded by experts on women and minority recruitment. Why Diversity For those who are wondering why Microsoft is obsessed with diversity and inclusion, there is a prevailing theory that these variables drive the success of companies that rely on innovation to thrive. Microsoft is not the only tech company aggressively pursuing this strategy. Intel has allocated $300 million last year to improve the diversity of its workforce. Nadella, in his early days as Microsoft's CEO, drew an immense amount of flak for saying that women should just have faith and wait for rewards when asked whether they should ask for equal pay.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr @ satprnews.com Streaming Video Alliance Introduces New Virtual Reality Study Group at Today's Quarterly Member Meeting The Streaming Video Alliance (SVA), a global industry forum comprised of leading companies from the online video ecosystem, today convenes in Denver at Level 3 headquarters for the Quarterly Member Meeting. The final meeting of 2016 includes a full day of interactive discussions and presentations and a keynote from Level 3’s SVP of Network Software Development, Travis Ewert. The Alliance also welcomes Adobe as the newest member to join.  Introduced at today’s meeting is the Streaming Video Alliance’s Virtual Reality / 360-Degree Video Study Group. While virtual reality / 360-degree video has the potential to revolutionize the video experience, widespread adoption is challenged by a lack of industry standards. The Alliance’s group will seek to understand and document the VR industry in an effort to identify opportunities for developing best practices. The study group will issue an industry report on the findings in Q2 of 2017.  The Alliance’s Working Groups will comprise a significant portion of today’s agenda, where members break out into separate sessions to move forward on a broad range of important streaming topics. Of note, the Quality of Experience Working Group will be finalizing documents for distribution to the CTA (as part of the Alliance’s partnership), and the Open Caching Working Group will be in member voting.  “It was two years ago that the Streaming Video Alliance was founded with the intention of addressing key industry and online video ecosystem challenges, and we’ve made significant progress since then,” said Jason Thibeault, Executive Director, Streaming Video Alliance. “We’ve expanded to multiple Working Groups, held our first international member meeting and grown membership. As we approach 2017, we remain just as focused on fostering industry collaboration to help define the open architecture for streaming.” Members of the Alliance include: Adobe, ARRIS, Cedexis, Charter Communications, Ciena, Cisco, Comcast, Concurrent, Conviva, Encompass TV, Ericsson, FOX Networks, Hughes Satellite Systems, IneoQuest, Intel, Irdeto, Level 3 Communications, Liberty Global, Limelight Networks, MediaMelon, MLBAM, Mobolize, Nagra, NBCUniversal, NeuLion, Nice People at Work, Nokia, Nominum, OWNZONES, Qwilt, Sky, System73, Telecom Italia, Telstra, Ustream, ViaPlay, ViaSat Inc., Verimatrix, Verizon, Vubiquity, Wowza Media Systems and Yahoo. For more information on today’s SVA meeting, the Working Groups or to inquire about becoming a member, visit www.streamingvideoalliance.org. About the Streaming Video Alliance Founded in 2014, the Streaming Video Alliance’s (SVA) charter is to encourage deeper collaboration across the entire online video ecosystem, which will include the development of standards and best practices for an open architecture that will operate across the entire online video value chain. The SVA is currently focused on identifying issues and solutions related to open architecture, quality of experience and interoperability.
