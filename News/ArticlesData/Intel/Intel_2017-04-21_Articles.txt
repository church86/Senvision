Its ultra-budget price paired with midrange specs resulted in a notebook that was far better than it should have been for such a ridiculously low price. Chuwi had already made a name for itself with well-received hybrid Windows tablets — namely the Hi12 tablet — so high quality wasn’t a huge surprise, and now the company is launching its most highly-anticipated device yet, the Hi13. I’ve spent about a week using it off and on, and if there’s one I can say with utter certainty it’s that there’s no way this thing should cost $1,000 less than a Surface Book. Don't Miss: These leaked iPhone 8 schematics are a travesty if they’re real On the specs front, the Hi13 isn’t a groundbreaking device, but it holds its own. It’s packed with a 64-bit quad-core Intel Apollo Lake processor and relies on Intel’s integrated graphics to do the heavy lifting on video and other visually intense applications. It features 4 GB of RAM and a modest 64 GB of built-in storage (expandable via SD card slot). A rear-facing 5 MP camera and front-facing 2 MP lens help it pull its weight as a standalone tablet, but it won’t win any photography competitions. Windows 10 Home edition is the standard operating system. The midrange internals pull their weight well, which is particularly surprising when you get a glimpse of the Hi13’s display. Believe it or not, despite an asking price of less than one-third that of Microsoft’s Surface Book, the Chuwi Hi13 utilizes the same 13.5-inch 10-point multitouch display. Its 3000 x 2000 resolution at 267 ppi looks gorgeous, and I was consistently shocked every time I remembered that the Hi13 is supposed to be considered a “budget” device. Most daily computer tasks like web browsing and streaming video feel great on the Hi13, and it can crush 4K YouTube videos with seemingly little effort. That being said, your choice of web browser is something you’ll want to consider on this device, as I’ve found using Chrome to be a rather miserable experience. It got so bad that I actually gave Microsoft Edge a try and found it to be so much faster that I’ve completely abandoned Chrome on this particular computer. Whether it’s simply Chrome’s resource-hogging habits or the quirks of touchscreen browsing on a Windows device, you’ll be best served by sticking with Microsoft’s new browser for your surfing needs on the Hi13. As a touchscreen, the display is responsive and very accurate, making web browsing by touch and basic tablet tasks feel smooth and fluid. The screen automatically reorients itself based on how you hold it, and even if you’ve never held a Windows tablet before, it’s very easy to use. The touchscreen keyboard can be opened and closed in an instant, and typing on it is essentially the same as a smartphone, which is neither a pro nor a con. The Hi13 is heavy for a tablet, weighing nearly two and a half pounds, and much of that is owed to the 10,000mAh battery which gives it full-day battery life in most cases, though that can obviously dip significantly if you find yourself streaming HD movies at full brightness. A lock/wake button and volume rocker rest on one side, with the SD card slot, USB-C charging port, MicroUSB and Micro HDMI ports grouped on the edge opposite the Windows touch button. As a tablet, the Hi13 is much, much more capable and impressive than its $369 price tag (or as low as $335, depending on your luck) indicates. Is it going to run circles around the Surface Book? No, but when you’re saving around $1,000 over the price of Microsoft’s beast, you’re going to be perfectly okay with that. Accessories Unlike the Surface Book, Chuwi’s Hi13 makes its add-on keyboard and pen completely optional purchases. They’re priced very, very low, at around $50 for the keyboard and $20 to $25 for the HiPen H3, so they’re no-brainers, but you don’t have to buy them if you don’t want them. Of the two, I’d highly recommend picking up the Hi13 keyboard at the very least. It snaps in effortlessly with a pair of powerful magnets and can be reversed if you want to position the screen in “tent mode” as well. It’s a full-sized keyboard with chiclet style textured keys, a metal top casing and faux-metal plastic rear. There’s hardware keys for volume and brightness, the latter of which was an unfortunate omission from the Lapbook 14.1. The keyboard’s built-in touchpad is quite good as well, and a big improvement over the Lapbook 14.1. It’s much more smooth and feels more accurate, while providing the familiar dual-level click and tap controls that you’d expect from a higher end Windows notebook. The HiPen H3 is quite nice as well, with a very clean design, extremely sturdy metal clip and well-positioned side buttons. The pen’s 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity make the writing experience feel top notch, and the screen response time is fast enough that you can easily lose yourself in your scribbles without worrying about delay between pen and virtual paper. The pen attaches to the side of the tablet via a hidden magnet, which is a nice touch. If you’re an artist it’s an easy recommendation, but if you have no use for such a device, you can just as easily skip it. All-in-all, the Hi13 is another impressive and extremely affordable device from Chuwi, which is starting to really cement a reputation as an example of how Chinese tech firms could beat western brands at their own game. Later this month, Chuwi is set to reveal its Lapbook 12.3, which will pack similar internals to the Hi13 but bump up the memory to 6 GB, and an extremely sharp IPS display. In short, if you haven’t been keeping at least a casual eye on what Chuwi has been cranking out, it’s probably time to consider it.

Gigabyte's latest Brix IoT packs a Core i3 for extra grunt by Wayne Manion  1:00 PM on April 20, 2017 A couple of weeks ago we wrote about Gigabyte's Brix IoT PCs—a pair of fanless miniature computers with Intel Apollo Lake SoCs inside. We read over at Fanlesstech that the company has expanded the Brix IoT range with models packing a dual-core 2.4 GHz Intel Core i3-7100U CPU. The brawnier GB-EKi3A-7100 also packs two USB 3.1 ports, though it loses some of the connectivity options present on its less-powerful siblings. The Core i3 machine has an HDMI jack and a mini-DisplayPort. When the appropriate DisplayPort daisy-chaining hardware is in play, the PC can drive three independent displays, something that's bound to be useful in digital signage applications. The Kaby Lake integrated graphics can drive 3840x2160 displays at up to 60 Hz, a step up from the 4K-at-30 Hz limitation of the Apollo Lake versions.   For peripheral connectivity, the EKi3A-7100 has a pair of USB 3.0 jacks, plus one USB 3.1 Type-A port and one USB 3.1 Type-C connector. The included Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity are all provided by Intel controllers. The Core version of the Brix IoT can run on input voltages from 12V to 19V. Gigabyte supplies a 65W, 19V external power brick with the machine. Serial UART connectivity is available with a standard nine-pin connector. Buyers who opt for the EKi3A-7100 instead of its smaller cousins will have to give up the microSD slot, the second Gigabit Ethernet port, and the GSM connectivity. The extra CPU power and graphics grunt make that exchange mostly a fair one, though. The Core version of Gigabyte's Brix IoT fanless mini PC measures a diminutive 7.1" x 4.6" x 1.4" (18 cm x 12 cm x 3.6 cm)—just a bit larger than the Apollo Lake versions in every dimension. Gigabyte did not provide pricing or availability information, though we expect the Core version to cost a bit more than the Celeron and Pentium versions.

Opinion: Electron Is Flash For The Desktop Patch Fixes Broken Updates On Windows 7 And 8.1 Running Ryzen, Kaby Lake CPUs Logan Booker Apr 22, 2017, 1:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  amd Australian Stories intel windows windows 7 windows 8.1 Share Image: Intel Microsoft has gone ahead with its plan to disable updates on pre-Windows 10 operating systems running on newer AMD and Intel processors. While your machine won't suddenly stop working, it does mean your Windows 7 or 8.1 install won't benefit from the latest updates. Fortunately, a simple workaround is now available. As predicted, an enterprising coder by the handle "zeffy" dived into Windows' internals and discovered where and how Microsoft performs the check. He or she explored a number of avenues and came up with two options to "fix" the problem. Both involved edits to a file called "wuaueng.dll", with one appearing to be an "internal testing feature used by Microsoft" and "could be removed in future updates", ruling it out in zeffy's mind. The second choice requires a "simple 1-byte change" and is the path the coder went with. The result is a patch anyone can apply to their Windows 7 or 8.1 installation. Of course, the patch comes with some caveats: You have to apply a new patch whenever wuaueng.dll gets updated. SFC scan errors will most likely occur as it will believe the integrity of the system has been compromised. If you can live with these, the patch is available from zeffy's GitHub repository.

Rumor: Intel Skylake-X and X299 will headline Computex 2017 by Wayne Manion  3:43 PM on April 21, 2017 A couple of weeks ago, whispers were swirling that Intel was moving the launch of its Basin Falls high-end desktop platform and its component CPUs up from late July to the end of June. Earlier this week, the rumor mill was churning out reports that the silicon giant would show off Basin Falls at Computex at the end of May. Benchlife is adding fuel to the fire today with more specific details about the replacements for Broadwell-E and X99. Based on a reading of an automated translation, the page appears to contain four specific pieces of information that were not a part of the rumors we reported on earlier. The story contains reportedly-leaked information that Intel senior vice president Navin Shenoy will deliver a keynote speech at Computex 2017. The fact that an Intel senior VP will be delivering the keynote suggests that it may be a major announcement. The company has already shown off its first wave of 3D XPoint products for servers and client computers, and the launch of the mainstream successor to Kaby Lake is still months away. That leaves the launch of HEDT processors and chipsets as the most likely subject for the rumored speech.  Previous rounds of rumors have speculated on the public announcement of the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors and accompanying X299 chipset, but today's grist is the first to speculate on a specific retail availability date. Benchlife says that products will hit the retail channel on June 26. The latest wave of speculation also suggests that the Skylake-X family of processors will include 12-core versions in addition to the previously-rumored six, eight, and 10-core versions. Meanwhile, the Kaby Lake-X family of CPUs is still expected to contain only quad-core variants with dual-channel DDR4 memory controllers. The last specific detail is speculation that the Skylake-X CPUs will have "up to 44" PCIe 3.0 lanes. The least-expensive Broadwell-E chip, the Core i7-6800K, has 28 lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity, while its three siblings all get 40 lanes to work with. The use of the phrase "up to" suggests that Intel will continue with its tiered approach to PCIe bandwidth in its HEDT platform. Kaby Lake-X is rumored to be limited to the same 16 lanes of PCIe connectivity as Intel's mainstream desktop parts, adding further uncertainty to what exactly the benefits of Kaby Lake-X will be versus the existing offerings. As Computex draws closer, the loose lips will doubtless let slip more information about whatever it is that Intel plans to show off at the largest computer hardware show of the year.

(GuruFocus) The Vetr crowd on Friday downgraded its rating for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) from 3 stars (Hold), issued 11 days ago, to 2.5 stars (Sell). Crowd sentiment at the time of the downgrade was generally positive, with 77 percent of Vetr user ratings bullish. The downgrade comes one week before Intel is set to release its first quarter earnings. Share price in the company has trended down through most of 2017 from a high of about $38, finding a range between $35 and $36 for most of the past two months. However, Intel's price has a history of spiking up on the approach in the case of previous reports, particularly given the company's fairly consistent record of beating on earnings, which it has maintained for seven earnings seasons. Learn how crowdsourced ratings could help you time the market. Currently, the Vetr crowd's average target price for Intel is down at $35.07, which is below the average analyst rating of $40.41.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel may accelerate its CPU timeline in response… Intel may accelerate its CPU timeline in response to Ryzen, report says By Brad Jones — April 19, 2017 9:51 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The rivalry between Intel and AMD is heating up once again, which will hopefully mean that users get both companies' best offerings faster and at a better price. Since its launch in February, Ryzen has proven to be a major boon for AMD, prompting speculation that the company is in the midst of a major comeback. That seems to have triggered a response from its biggest rival, as Intel is apparently making preparations to accelerate its release schedule. Sources in the Taiwanese computing industry are reporting that Intel will lift the lid on its Basin Falls platform at Computex 2017, according to Hexus. This event begins at the end of May, which means that the reveal is coming a few months earlier than previously anticipated. Basin Falls is comprised of the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors, as well as the X299 chipset. Skylake-X will apparently consist of three 140W processors that utilize architectures with six, eight, or 10 cores. A 12-core variant will apparently follow in December. Basin Falls is expected to launch at E3 2017 in June, several weeks after it is scheduled to be unveiled at Computex. Meanwhile, Intel is also amending its plans for the release of the 14nm Coffee Lake architecture. The first chips produced as part of the line were expected to be made available in early 2018, but it now seems that they could be released as early as August. Intel has apparently increased its manufacturing capacity by purchasing five new EUV machine sets from Dutch photolithography specialists ASML. This hardware will be used to make several K-series Core i3, i5, and i7 processors and Z370 chipsets available later this year, with further CPUs and H370, H310, and B360 chipsets set to follow in subsequent months. If Intel’s amended schedule is accurate, the company is poised to showcase Basin Falls at two major conferences related to the computing and video game industries. As its years-long rivalry with AMD continues, all eyes will be on Basin Falls over the next few months.

(AMD) Stock’s Ryzen 5 Is a Game Changer AMD stock may finally have what it needs to challenge Intel better By Chris Lau, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 21, 2017, 1:40 pm EDT     Popular Posts: 7 Tech Stocks That Are a Sneeze Away From Collapsing Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock’s Ryzen 5 Is a Game Changer Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Still Has Nothing to Fear From Snapchat Recent Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock’s Ryzen 5 Is a Game Changer Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Still Has Nothing to Fear From Snapchat Why You Shouldn’t Count Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Out Just Yet View All Posts The PC CPU market is in need of a shake-up. After nearly a decade with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) dominating the chip market, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a chance to disrupt the leader. And markets are signalling AMD has a good chance of succeeding this year. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Intel is valued at just 12 times forward earnings and is cheap compared to AMD. It has yet to report sales for its latest CPU, Ryzen. For now, the stock’s value is inflated, with a forward P/E of 45 times. AMD’s Ryzen 5 Targets the Mainstream Market In March, AMD released Ryzen 7, a high-end processor that targeted the enthusiast market. It followed this month with Ryzen 5. This processor is more affordable and targets the mainstream market. On April 11, one technology review sites even declared the Ryzen 5 the most significant gaming CPU AMD ever made. The site singled out aggressive pricing, high computing power with six-cores and comparable performance to Intel as reasons for the claim. Retailers are pricing Ryzen 5 as low as $189 for the four-core 1500X. The 1600X, which has six cores, is nearly identical to the Ryzen 7 1800X. Budget PC builders may flock to this chip to save money. The higher core count also helps it outperform INTC chips for things like video encoding and video processing. Games that demand multiprocessing, like Civilization VI, also work better on AMD. Earnings Report on May 1 AMD confirmed that it will report quarterly results on May 1 after the market closes. The report will give investors an idea on the sales strength for Ryzen 7. It launched the chip at the beginning of March. A strong sales report will help AMD’s stock recover. CEO Lisa Su will likely confirm that the company will release Ryzen for notebooks and servers on time. Markets expect the release for notebooks will happen sometime in the second half of the year. Dubbed Naples, AMD expects to release the two-socket server chip based on the Ryzen platform in the second quarter. It will compete against Intel’s Broadwell server chips. Early benchmarks suggest that Naples will have more memory bandwidth to work with. That gives AMD’s solution an edge over Intel’s server chip. It is too early for investors to forecast market share growth for AMD in the server market. Pricing and chip speed will be the two factors that will shape AMD’s success in this segment of the market. Competition Heats Up With Nvidia Investors should not forget about AMD’s Polaris graphics card release from last year. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) already responded to AMD by discounting prices of its GPU cards. The 1080 Founders Edition and 1080 GTX, for example, are on sale on Amazon.com. AMD will eventually launch Vega, a high-end GPU, this year. NVDA benefits from pushing out those cards now, before that happens. Once AMD releases Vega, Nvidia will probably discount prices for the high-end cards by even more. Takeaway on Advanced Micro Devices AMD will likely reiterate strong expectations for Ryzen. The chip release will help the company win back market share in the PC desktop, notebook and server markets. Consider the stock as a good speculation with upside potential. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. Oklahoma enters the spring evaluation period with six commits for the 2018 class as #SavageTeam2K18 has landed three in the Scout 150. That’s good. There has been some bad as well. But the point of this is to get a feel of exactly who OU fans should be pretty pumped about and who you might start to realize is never going to be a Sooner. Basing this off the idea there will be 22-24 signees for 2018. Committed (6) http://www.scout.com/player/194203-brey-walker http://www.scout.com/player/198166-t-j-pledger http://www.scout.com/player/203152-cameron-rising http://www.scout.com/player/209431-patrick-fields http://www.scout.com/player/209528-jordan-kelley http://www.scout.com/player/191770-jordon-austin There’s nothing to watch at the moment with Walker, Pledger, Fields and Kelley. Fields has taken the role of being the vocal leader of the class, and we’ll see how that pans out. The two to watch are Rising and Austin. Rising hasn’t said much since his visit to OU two weeks ago and his trip to Texas last week. Maybe silence isn’t that bad, though. Maybe nothing is being said because nothing needs to be said. Perhaps he’s always been solid to OU despite these trips and because nothing has changed doesn’t feel the need to address it. Perhaps. Then there’s Austin. No doubt he wants to be a Sooner. He absolutely wants to follow in Dakota’s footsteps and play at Owen Field. Will he survive the class is the question? He’ll need to show he’s fully recovered from his torn ACL and is an even better player than before. Locks (or as much as one can be) (6) http://www.scout.com/player/212850-ron-tatum?s=73 It’s just hard to see this not going OU’s way. He’s releasing a top five Friday, and there’s no doubt the Sooners will be in it. Multiple trips to Norman during the spring just seem to reaffirm how well the Sooners are doing here. http://www.scout.com/player/207850-jalen-redmond?s=73 The Nebraska visit was a major one, but OU has been there since the start, since before he even had any film to send out. The Sooners have done things correctly here, and it should pay off all in due time. Have to lock down the in-state offers. http://www.scout.com/player/215347-starrland-baldwin?s=73 Still there standing as a lock but also waiting for that next move by Baldwin. The euphoria seems to have died down from OU being his first major offer, but he doesn’t seem to have lost any love for OU so maybe it’s just a waiting game. http://www.scout.com/player/211024-treveon-johnson?s=73 Classified as a safety, this Texas Tech commit is being viewed as a receiver for the Sooners. He didn’t make the spring game so nothing materialized there. If he can make it to Norman sooner than later, expect the flip. Longer the wait, though, could become dicey. http://www.scout.com/player/200652-darrell-simpson?s=73 You still watch offensive line coach Bill Bedenbaugh and you still see the incredible lack of offensive tackle offers. As long as that’s the case, OU fans should rest easy. Sooners made Simpson’s final eight last week, but you sort of want this one to be done as fast as possible. http://www.scout.com/player/199570-miguel-edwards?s=73 Where did he come from? Credit to Scout’s Corey Bender for the update two weeks ago. Seems like as long as OU can get Edwards to campus here soon, the commitment is essentially guaranteed. Good news in the secondary would be very much welcomed right now. Looking good (5) http://www.scout.com/player/214934-anthony-mckinney?s=73 McKinney was among OU’s first offers at offensive tackle even though he’s a junior college kid. He has already set his OU official for June 2-4 since juco kids can visit during the summer. There’s a lot to like for OU at this time. http://www.scout.com/player/207687-alston-orji?s=73 This is venturing close to that Darrell Simpson spot where you’re starting to wonder if something is missing after all these OU trips the family has made because they’ve made a ton. It would be big shot in the arm for Tim Kish to get someone like Orji. http://www.scout.com/player/214585-miles-emery?s=73 Emery’s recruitment has gone through a world of change since the OU visit for junior day. Calvin Thibodeaux must prioritize Emery this spring and think it will all work out. He wants to be done before summer, give him a reason to make that jump. http://www.scout.com/player/202660-bobby-brown?s=73 Again, hard to gauge when Brown isn’t very active on social media and isn’t very active in making trips or participating in camps. OU has felt like the clear leader for a while, but stress that fact it was a while ago since anything concrete had been released about Brown. http://www.scout.com/player/212694-noah-boykin?s=73 You can tell me Boykin is going to stay closer to home and won’t argue. But if OU wants Boykin and Boykin is serious about the Sooners, it does feel like this one will eventually align up. Parnell Motley and Abdul Adams could help OU’s chances here. Work to be done http://www.scout.com/player/203260-josh-proctor?s=73 Obviously. We’ve discussed this like crazy this week. Will Kerry Cooks keep calling? Will Proctor keep listening? Nothing we can answer on April 21. http://www.scout.com/player/188210-trevor-trout?s=73 Can’t see why OU would pass up on Trout, but who knows exactly what OU is thinking right now with defensive line recruiting? http://www.scout.com/player/206207-ronnie-perkins?s=73 OU can get Perkins, but it’s going to have put forth the push to make it happen. A defensive end trio of Tatum, Emery and Perkins would be elite as it gets for OU. http://www.scout.com/player/214524-tommy-bush?s=73 Strong feeling OU can close the gap with spring visits or with a trip from Bush during the early summer. The Sooners have tough competition, especially from Baylor, so will be about the work that is put in. Who knows? *Is Izaiah Filikitonga’s offer committable at this point? *Would OU use a scholarship on Drake Stoops? Or hope he accepts a walk-on spot? Is there a slot option outside of Stoops? *Does OU really feel need for second running back? *Will Curtis Dunlap give OU a fighting chance despite not being near the ocean for an oceanography degree? 2018 class as of April 21 QB – Cameron Rising RB – T.J. Pledger H-Back – Vernon Jackson (?) WR – Tommy Bush, Treveon Johnson, Drake Stoops (?) OT – Brey Walker, Darrell Simpson, Anthony McKinney OG – Curtis Dunlap (?) DE – Ron Tatum, Miles Emery, Ronnie Perkins (?) DT – Jordan Kelley, Bobby Brown, Trevor Trout (?) OLB – Jalen Redmond, ??? ILB – Alston Orji, ??? CB – Miguel Edwards, Starrland Baldwin, Noah Boykin (?) S/NB – Patrick Fields, Jordon Austin, ??? Not exactly a set-in stone picture there. If OU hit on all the question marks in parentheses, that’s a 23-member class. But do think like if OU doesn’t take an H-Back, then it makes sure it takes another linebacker or something of that nature. No worries at quarterback, running back and offensive line at this moment. Linebacker is where you’re still scratching your head because just not a lot of realistic targets right now. OU has made offers, just don’t see them mattering yet. Wide receiver is in a bit of a rut, but Dennis Simmons and Cale Gundy should strike gold somewhere based on track record.   Defensive line has so many options but will be more about a numbers crunch and Calvin Thibodeaux closing the deals on some highly coveted kids. Secondary has seen Cooks swing-and-miss with some major targets. He’s not discouraged but has to hit on some of these recent guys and maybe win back Proctor to solidify the class.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout 2019 OKPreps primer, Pt.

The Grand Features Of Mesa 17.1: Vega, RadeonSI Shader Cache, Maturing Vulkan, New OpenGL Extensions Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 21 April 2017. Page 1 of 1. 6 Comments We are just a few weeks out from the release of Mesa 17.1 as the latest quarterly update to this important component to the open-source 3D Linux graphics driver stack. With "Mesa 17.1" already having been mentioned in 102 Phoronix articles to date, here's a look at some of the most exciting changes and new features with Mesa 17.1. For those behind on their Phoronix reading or lose track with our daily coverage of Linux news 365 days per year, Mesa 17.1 highlights include: - With the other key Mesa drivers already being at OpenGL 4.5 (with the exception of Nouveau not yet exposing GL 4.4/4.5), there isn't too much in terms of major version bumps except for... Intel Ivy Bridge at OpenGL 4.2! Up to now Ivy Bridge has only exposed OpenGL 3.3, but thanks to work done by Igalia and others, OpenGL 4.2 is now reached after finishing up the FP64-related work. So for those still on this generation of Intel hardware prior to Haswell, OpenGL 4.2 is in place but given the age of the Intel integrated graphics, don't expect to do too much Linux gaming still, at least for newer titles. - Radeon RX Vega support is now present within the RadeonSI Gallium3D driver. But you'll also need AMDGPU support kernel-side: with Linux 4.12 the AMDGPU Vega support doesn't support physical displays, so it won't be until at least Linux 4.13 when that will be mainline. So if you want to use Mesa 17.1 with Radeon RX Vega next month, you will need to build an out-of-tree kernel module. You will also need to be using LLVM 5.0 SVN/Git. - The Mesa shader cache support was merged both for the TGSI shader cache as well as the RadeonSI binary shader cache! This should help game load times for newer titles. Currently the cache is enabled by default but we'll see if they change that prior to the Mesa 17.1.0 release. - Basic Nouveau TGSI shader cache is also present. - The initial OpenGL threaded dispatch code was merged. - There's also been a variety of OpenGL extension work for those not part of a formal OpenGL version. Some of this work includes ARB_gpu_shader_int64 for all the key drivers, ARB_shader_ballot / ARB_shader_clock / ARB_shader_group_vote for RadeonSI, ARB_sparse_buffer for newer AMD GPUs when also paired with what will be the Linux 4.12 kernel, ARB_transform_feedback2 is now supported on older Sandy Bridge hardware. - Intel's Open SWR software rasterizer now has geometry shader support as well as MSAA support. - The ILO Gallium3D driver has been dropped with this Intel G3D driver not being maintained anymore by LunarG. - INTEL_performance_query was restored for the Intel Mesa driver. - The old Intel i915 Mesa driver has decided to drop from OpenGL 2.1 to 1.4 by default. - Performance improvements for various GPUs, especially for RadeonSI given the work notably done by AMD and Valve. - GLVND support for EGL, the OpenGL Vendor Neutral Dispatch Library now working outside of GLX. - Numerous Vulkan updates for Radeon RADV and Intel ANV. A number of the Vulkan 1.0.42 features are now in place. Notable for RADV is also tessellation shader support and geometry shader support and initial PRIME support and spilling support and fast clears. ANV also has MSAA compression support. This work also puts the Mesa Vulkan drivers closer to being suitable for SteamVR on Linux. The Intel Vulkan driver also now works on Android./ - The Freedreno Gallium3D Driver for Qualcomm Adreno hardware has seen some performance improvements and other work. Mesa 17.1 should be released early-to-mid May. If I missed covering any other interesting changes of Mesa 17.1, feel free to point them out in the forums. Overall this should be another damn fine update to Mesa. I've already published many Mesa 17.1 benchmarks but more are on the way.

Which prospects will land offers this weekend? The Insider Report also details an underclassman critical to the Irish next cycle. He’s on campus today. Notre Dame has a chance to push its recruiting class forward during Blue-Gold Game weekend with more than a dozen visitors scheduled for South Bend. Here’s what you need to know and whom you need to track. The Top Targets http://www.scout.com/player/199964-kevin-austin?s=109 Recruiting Recap: Austin won MVP honors at the wide receiver spot at The Opening Regional in Miami, which got him invited to The Finals this summer. He’s been to Notre Dame before and has family in the Midwest. In other words, he knows plenty about the program before this weekend. The goal now is to quickly build a rapport with Del Alexander. If they hit it off, look out. Notre Dame could grab this four-star before he heads back to Florida. The Intel: “He plans to take his time when attacking the recruiting process, but ND's Autry Denson is certainly pushing all the right buttons and making a significant impression on Austin. The Fighting Irish are sitting in a great spot right now. Austin is a glider that not only utilizes his frame by high-pointing the ball and out-muscling defensive backs, but also does a nice job of navigating after the catch. This is a big body who creates plenty of mismatches with his frame and playmaking ability. Austin shows good field vision and does a great job of making strong cuts without placing his foot on the brake. You just have to love his ability to time his jump and extend out for the football, but he shows some shiftiness to finish off the play as well.” – Florida analyst Corey Bender Commit Watch: Maybe. Austin went on record with Irish Illustrated that he won’t commit this weekend. And yet, he’ll be here with both parents and should get a ton of attention from the staff and other commits. Be on alert. http://www.scout.com/player/200862-chase-cota?s=109 Recruiting Recap: Cota took April visits to UCLA and USC while also picking up a recent offer from Georgia. According to his high school coach, Notre Dame has hosted Cota before when he made a national tour of schools with his uncle. While the dad’s connections to Oregon (football alumnus) and UCLA (played for Jim Mora in the NFL) are worth noting, so too is the fact Chad Cota played for the Colts when Bill Polian ran that organization. Brian Polian is now serving as Notre Dame’s lead recruiter here. The Intel: “He's really been a big pass-catching target for three years but has taken it to another level this spring, mainly with some of the times he's clocked at various camps. He's a 6-foot-4 receiver running legit 4.5's, so he has the speed to go with the size and big catch radius. We've got him No. 3 out West at wide receiver and he's a top 10 wide receiver nationally, on track to be the highest rated wide receiver to ever come out of Oregon. He's a top 50 national guy too.” – national analyst Brandon Huffman Commit Watch: Low. If this was Cota’s first visit to Notre Dame there would be no chance, but the family knows the Irish program and the staff. Plus, Braden Lenzy will be here. The Oregon athletes aren’t tight, but they know each other. http://www.scout.com/player/200368-dallas-gant?s=109 Recruiting Recap: Gant has been a regular at Notre Dame for the past year, going back to Irish Invasion when he worked out with Mathew Bauer. Now he’s less than a month away from a May 16 commitment date, with Notre Dame, Ohio State and Michigan the primary contenders. The Irish might represent the final visit before that commitment, usually a good sign. Gant would represent a perfect game of sorts for linebackers coach Clark Lea with Bauer and Ovie Oghoufo already on board. Oghoufo will be back in South Bend this weekend. He plans to tag team Gant with cornerback commitment Kalon Gervin. The Intel: “Dallas is a long, athletic prospect who, physically, is the prototype outside linebacker. He named a top five, which Notre Dame is in. The buzz in Ohio is for the Buckeyes, but there has been talk that that is not a done deal. Notre Dame and Michigan are considered the two schools that can be the biggest threats to the Buckeyes.” – Midwest analyst Allen Trieu Commit Watch: Low. Unless we’re talking silent commitments, there’s no way Gant makes a decision this weekend considering he has his announcement date set. http://www.scout.com/player/198532-p-j-mustipher?s=109 Recruiting Recap: The younger brother of Irish center Sam Mustipher has kept a low profile during his recruitment, in part because he has more here-and-now priorities. The heavyweight wrestler won a championship last winter before jumping into spring ball. He also took a visit to Penn State this off-season. Tennessee got a look too. Notre Dame should be considered the slight favorite based on the sibling connection and the fact the Irish have logged multiple visits the past couple seasons. The Intel: “Notre Dame is always among the top teams in the discussion because his brother, Sam, plays there. He made a recent visit to Tennessee, and was at Ohio State at the beginning of the month. He also made a March visit to Michigan State, but Notre Dame, Ohio State and Tennessee are the schools to watch. Also, do not be surprised if Mustipher becomes involved with Alabama. As a player, he is very intriguing. He has a lot of offensive lineman skills, and would be a tremendous guard, but he loves defensive tackle and schools are recruiting him to play there. He possesses very good body control and can be an effective run stopper. Mustipher is explosive. – East Coast analyst Brian Dohn Commit Watch: Decent. Notre Dame has done the legwork here and Mustipher has all the information he needs to make a decision. If the Irish off-season sells as well in recruiting as it has during spring ball, maybe Mustipher crosses the finish line. http://www.scout.com/player/211131-nasir-peoples?s=109 Recruiting Recap: Peoples committed to Virginia Tech in February after picking up an offer from the Hokies earlier that month. That’s a quick recruitment, which probably sets up nicely for Notre Dame. Virginia Tech, even though Peoples called it a “dream school,” hasn’t had a lot of time to build a relationship with this cornerback. Notre Dame has already offered, so there shouldn’t be an interest gap between player and program. Again, the Irish need cornerback help. The Intel: “Peoples is committed to Virginia Tech, but shortly after the decision received an offer from Notre Dame and set up a visit. The Irish are a realistic flip option, and it could take place sooner rather than later. In college, Peoples could play safety or cornerback. He will have to show his has the hip fluidity and speed to play cornerback, but the versatility he provides is intriguing. He drives to the ball well, but he needs to work on his change of direction. He is a good tackler, and active in coverage.” – Dohn Commit Watch: Medium. This would be a quick flip, although Notre Dame has targeted former Virginia Tech commitments before. Could the Irish do it again? http://www.scout.com/player/193147-l-christian-smith?s=109 Recruiting Recap: Smith revealed plans to attend the Blue-Gold Game during a stop at The Opening Regional outside Cleveland. The Irish were the only school mentioned in addition to Ohio State and Kentucky. Smith was in Columbus for the Buckeyes’ spring game last weekend. He also has a former prep teammate at Kentucky, which has created some interest in the Wildcats. Like most Ohio prospects that Ohio State wants, the Buckeyes will be tough to beat. However, the Irish will show off their corps of jumbo receivers on Saturday. Smith would be another one of those. The Intel: “There has been a lot of controversy on Twitter with him calling out those who say he’s a tight end. In his early days, I think that thought was that he may grow into one, but now I think it is pretty clear he is a big wide receiver. Kentucky and Ohio State were considered two of primary schools in this race, but he has always spoken highly of Notre Dame and I think the Irish can climb in this race.” – Trieu Commit Watch: None. Smith is record that he’ll commit in September. On top of that, he said he’ll take his official visits after that decision. Offer Watch http://www.scout.com/player/216350-justin-birdsong?s=109 The three-star cornerback from Georgia has been up front with Irish Illustrated that he’s not just hoping for an offer this weekend, he’s expecting one. Considering the Irish would be his first Power 5 offer, that’s a reach on paper. Still, the Irish need cornerbacks in this class. But the more likely scenario has this weekend as an introduction between prospect and program, with an invite to return for the Irish Invasion put on the table. http://www.scout.com/player/212103-cagan-campbell?s=109 Scout analyst John Garcia is a believer in this two-star cornerback who’s way under the radar. “He is small and doesn’t camp. He is one you’ve got to see in person,” Garcia said. “Love him. Small but feisty and a legit track athlete as well.” Campbell told Irish Illustrated that a Notre Dame offer could reshape his recruitment. But like Birdsong, no Power 5 offers are on the table yet. Would he return for Irish Invasion to work out? http://www.scout.com/player/215833-dominique-hampton?s=109 Scout analyst Blair Angulo called Hampton a “late bloomer” entering the spring evaluation period, but now he’s got Arizona, Arizona State and Colorado on his offer list. Size at 6-foo-2 is a real plus for the Irish, even if Hampton is raw as a cornerback. In terms of the cornerbacks coming to the Blue-Gold Game without offers, Hampton has the biggest profile, by far. The fact he’s coming from Arizona is worth noting. Getting him out of state will take some work.   http://www.scout.com/player/210410-erick-hallett?s=109 A former high school teammate of Brock Wright, this Texas cornerback is light on offers but showed well at The Opening Regional in Louisiana this spring. Nevada and Washington State have already offered. Interest from Yale is worth noting. Like Birdsong and Campbell, it’s probably going to take an Irish Invasion workout to move Notre Dame into the offer column. Hallett seems open to that kind of investment. If Hallett was a bigger corner it might help his cause considering what Notre Dame needs. http://www.scout.com/player/203461-jalen-mayfield?s=109 The Insider Report has an interview with Mayfield below, but this might be the most likely of all the offers this weekend. The Irish need to expand their offensive line board, Mayfield has a connection to Brian Kelly and he’s a pure tackle. Michigan recently offered, which led to a de-commitment from Minnesota. In terms of athletic tackles, Mayfield fits the bill. It would be a surprise if Notre Dame didn’t offer based on the profile. Have Irish Found Their Next O-Line Target? Jalen Mayfield has never visited Notre Dame. Still, the four-star offensive tackle from Catholic Central in Grand Rapids, Mich., has a connection to the Irish program. Mayfield’s head coach there is Todd Kolster, a former offensive coordinator at Grand Valley State under Chuck Martin and staffer under Brian Kelly. So while the Irish will start building a rapport with the 6-foot-5, 260-pound athlete when he visits for the Blue-Gold Game this weekend, they already know plenty about Mayfield’s fit. “I don’t know any people who have played down there,” Mayfield said. “But I know coach (Brian) Kelly knows my coach here and they’ve been friends for a while. So it’s pretty cool to have that connection.” The Irish haven’t offered Mayfield but it’s easy to see that happening considering the four-star prospect’s skill set and Notre Dame’s needs. Mayfield is a pure tackle prospect with room to grow. He was a one-time commitment to Minnesota but backed off that pledge after Michigan offered. Now Notre Dame, which wants to sign at least two pure tackles in this class, could be next. The Irish wanted to get Mayfield on campus during spring practice but couldn’t match schedules. Mayfield attended the Michigan spring game last weekend. “I have really big interest,” Mayfield said. “That’s one of the best programs in the country year-in and year-out. That really interests me, all the history there. And they also really do well with their offensive linemen recently. “That part means a lot. It’s not just about playing at the next level, but just developing guys in college. You see the success they have doing that. That’s a big priority for me. If you don’t have the goal to play in the NFL, you’re not going to get very far. Developing NFL players, that’s a big part of what I want to see.” Mayfield, who will make the visit with his father, also wants to dig deeper into Notre Dame’s off-the-field opportunities. “When I visit places I want to mostly see academics,” Mayfield said. “I could see anything with facilities anywhere. You don’t get to see the academic side on TV. I want to study business management and I know Notre Dame is one of the best academic schools in the country.” Mayfield will arrive in South Bend with 14 total offers, a list that includes Michigan, Iowa, Michigan State, Arizona, Minnesota and Cincinnati. He said that in addition to Notre Dame, recent interest has come from Ohio State and Penn State. Indiana Rush End Could Key Irish In ‘19 The biggest underclassman headed to Blue-Gold Game weekend won’t be at the actual Blue-Gold Game. On Friday, sophomore defensive end Beau Robbins will make the drive up US-31 to Notre Dame as the 6-foot-5, 230-pounder pushes a recruitment forward that probably won’t need help getting started. The product of Carmel, Ind., already holds an offer from Indiana. Michigan and Minnesota visited this week to start the spring evaluation period. Ohio State and Northwestern already got visits. Now Notre Dame is up next. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he gets 15 offers in the next month just based on feedback that I’m getting,” said Carmel head coach John Hebert. “It’s gonna be a tidal wave here pretty soon.” Notre Dame can’t look in-state for pass rush help most cycles, at least not for athletes who fit profile for the program and University. Robbins won’t have that issue, with Stanford showing early interest too. The buzz about Robbins comes from the second half of his sophomore season when Hebert moved him from outside linebacker to defensive end. “It was just one highlight play after another,” Hebert said. “It just so happened that’s when we went from a 4-4 team to state champion. Having Beau in really any situation, in a running situations he’s just an un-blockable player and as a pass rusher even more so. “I think I knew he’d officially be a national recruit when our other FBS guys who were seniors couldn’t really block him last year in practice. And they’re good players. I don’t think we’ve even scratched the surface with Beau.” Robbins finished the season with approximately 10 sacks, according to Hebert. The Irish should be a player here moving forward. “I know he’s always liked Notre Dame,” Hebert said. “Beau is the kind of kid, I can really see him at one of the Midwest powers. Somewhere close, he’s a family-oriented guy.”   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Latest McIntosh eager to see Notre Dame Cavs have record-setting comeback win Book it: Long impressed by QB2 Video: Mike Elko will not promise quick fixes Video: Chip Long high on Alizé Jones Share & Embed Developmental Football 101 Wrapping Up Full Story IrishIllustrated.com Top Stories Developmental Football 101 Wrapping UpAreas where Elko believes the Irish have improved: Ball disruptions, leverage, playing with greater passion and reestablishing the line of scrimmage. by Tim Prister IrishIllustrated.comYesterday at 11:11 AM Latest McIntosh eager to see Notre DameFlorida running back Kenny McIntosh will be in South Bend this weekend to watch his brother, Deon McIntosh, compete in the Blue-Gold Game.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Intel to unveil Basin Falls platform in May, could launch Coffee Lake chips in August Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, April 21st, 2017, 05:54 Category: Hardware, iMac, Mac Pro, Processors, Rumor Intel is rumored to be moving the launch of its 13-nanometer Coffee Lake processors from January 2018 to August of 2017 due to “increasing competition from AMD’s Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors.” The rumor has it that Intel will release several K-series Core i3, i5, and i7 processors starting in August, along with its Z370 chipsets. Additional CPUs will come at the end of 2017 or early in 2018. Intel is also rumored to be unveiling its Basin Falls platform, complete with its Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors at Computex 2017, which is set to take place two months earlier than usual and will run from May 30th to June 3rd. Intel’s Skylake-X series features 140W processors with 6, 8, and 10-core architectures, while Kaby Lake X-series features a 112W quad-core processor. Intel also plans to release a 12-core Skylake-X processor in August. Intel’s Basin Falls platform could potentially be used in future Mac Pro machines and the rumored high-end server-grade iMac. It’s thought that Coffee Lake processors suitable for Apple products could launch in the second quarter of 2018. As such, the revised launch date could be moved forward to either late 2017 or early in 2018. Coffee Lake chips are manufactured on Intel’s 14-nanometer process and will be the fourth processor family to use the architecture after Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake. Apple is rumored to have new machines in the works for 2017, including new iMacs, which are likely to use Kaby Lake chips. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

We have been hearing about Intel’s NVM-based 3D XPoint Optane SSD for a while but they are finally shipping to end users now. For now, at least, that’ll predominantly comprise the enterprise sector and data centers, and for good reason. The 375 GB version of the SSD, dubbed the Optane SSD DC P4800X, retails for $1520, meaning it can be tough to find it in your local hardware store. More than 2 GB/s Read and Write Speeds But the price difference should be more than accounted for due to the stratospheric speeds these drives can achieve. The Optane SSDs will roughly offer 2.5 GB/s of sustained output and has ten times lower the latency of a normal SSD. The Optane recorded sequential reading and writing speeds of 2400 MB/s and 2000 MB/s, respectively. Overall, Intel claims that the storage will be 7-8 times faster compared to regular SSDs in the market, a figure which could be even higher if it wasn’t being used for existing hardware in the market. The storage can also be used as RAM if the user requires it to, seating it in the PCIe slot of your PC. The performance, when used as RAM, will be equal to about 80% of fastest RAMs on the market. Much More Durable Than Conventional SSDs Having been in the making for a long time, the Optane SSDs feature a 3D stacked design of memory cells, using only digital charge and no transistors. It retains its storage even while its powered off and can write up to 12.3 petabytes of data in a lifetime. It has ten times the density of DRAM and the same level of latency. Compared to NAND storage, it is 1000 times faster and features endurance by a similar measure. Intel plans to launch multiple storage variants, including 750 GB and 1.5 TB versions, as well as 750 GB and 1.5 TB U.2 versions in the market. After a while, there’ll be modules featuring separate DRAM as well. While Intel’s 3D XPoint is going to be the fastest storage around, it won’t hit the mainstream and challenge SSDs any time soon. Once it does, you can count on it to be the best one around in terms of performance.

Intel and Micron's new 3D XPoint NVM is starting to bridge the gap between these two technologies. In 3D XPoint storage, each data cell does not need a transistor so the storage density can be up to 4 times that of standard DRAM. It offers the incredibly fast speeds and access times of DRAM, but has the capacity of traditional flash storage. The very first product to feature this technology is a 375GB PCIe based SSD from Intel known as the Optane SSD DC P4800X. It is based on the popular NVMe standard and will retail for just over $1500. There are only limited reviews available now since Intel has been very secretive about the new drive. AnandTech and Tom's Hardware were only allowed to access it through a remote server to Intel's own facility. The technology is still young so there is still ongoing improvements to the software, but preliminary performance results are very impressive. As an overall drive, it is the single fastest SSD on the market. It drops behind a few high end drives in terms of read performance, but 2.5GBPs of sustained throughput is nothing to laugh at. Where the P4800X really shines though is in latency and IOPs. It has about 10x lower latency than previous drives coming in at between 10 and 100μs. The P4800X also delivers about 550k IOPS while current drives offer half of that amount. The new 3D XPoint drives currently don't offer game changing capacity, but their performance definitely destroys the competition. They are the best drive available for heavy enterprise level I/O operations. Don't expect this speed to be coming to the consumer market anytime soon though, but it's definitely out there somewhere on the horizon.

Will we see new iMacs, Mac minis, and Mac Pros? What will the iPhone 8 look like? And are there any new products we don't even know about yet? We gather the rumours and whispers about Apple and make our pedictions for the year ahead. by Martyn Casserly | 21 Apr 17 Contents iPhones iPads Apple Watch Series 3 Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we've donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: Many had anticipated that Apple would upgrade the iPhone SE model to the iPhone SE2 or SEs in March 2017, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. However the iPhone SE was only treated to a bump in storage to 32- and 128GB on 21 March and another update seems unlikely for now. We do still expect a new iPhone SE model at some point in the future, maybe in September or maybe in 2018 (KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7). When the new model launches it is likely to keep the existing, classic design, but feature upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. When? We think September  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: Apple made a minor update to the iPhone 7 during an Apple Store update on 21 March, adding a Product RED version. Product RED is a charity that attempts to eliminate AIDS in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the new red models of the iPhone 7 will go to the charity. Apple doesn't make it clear how much it donates to the charity, but it does say that since Product RED was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone. On to the new iPhones... There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. Alternatively, Apple might use facial recognition instead of/in addition to the fingerprint sensor. Apple reportedly purchased Israeli startup RealFace, which as the name hints specialises in facial recognition technology. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. When? We think September iPads New iPad Air: Since there was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 Apple fans were hoping for an update to that model soon. There were some concerns that the 9.7in iPad Pro had displaced the iPad Air line, but those fears were unfounded when Apple announced a new iPad in March 2017. Apple has done away with the Air from it's name, however: what was the iPad Air line is now just the iPad. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. read more here: New iPad latest. Apple stop using Air in all its product names very soon - as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update in 2016 and the retirement of the 11-inch version. When? We think 2018 iPad mini: The iPad mini received a minor update in March 2017, gaining more capacity for the same price (£419 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model and £549 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular). However, this was not the iPad mini 5 anticipated, and given that the iPad mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focused on its smaller tablets and Apple does state that the most popular tablet size is 9.7in. Perhaps October will see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher aluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 new feature rumours When? We think 2018 iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. We had hoped for an update to both in spring 2017, but no update was forthcoming. Apple did however introduce a new 9.7in iPad in the iPad Air category (so lacking the Apple Pencil support and featuring a A9 chip rather than the A9X, and £339, rather than £549. Apple may update the iPad Pro models in September or October 2017. Much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Kuo's thoughts were published before Apple lauched the new iPad 9.7in, which seems to sit as the lower powered version he predicted. Whether Apple would stop selling the 9.7in iPad Pro remains to be seen - the company has said it is its most popular sized iPad. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours When? We think October Apple Watch Series 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water-proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. Apple did offer some new Apple Watch bands in March 2017. These include a new wide stripe Woven Nylon band, standalone Nike Sport Bands and Apple Watch Hermès bands in new colours. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also speculated on the possibility of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also rumoured to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the AMOLED panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that. For a more in-depth look at the latest rumours on the Apple Watch be sure to check out our Apple Watch 3 rumours article.

We think September Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all? We'll keep researching and reporting our findings, so check back regularly. Read more about the Apple TV: Apple TV (2015) review | Best Apple TV apps | Tips for using the new Apple TV Siri Remote | New Apple TV release date rumours When? We think WWDC Macs The Mac Pro: The Mac Pro is long overdue a refresh as it hasn't been updated since its launch in 2013. The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. We were hopeful that March 2017 would see new Pros announced, but nothing has materialised yet. We think a WWDC launch in June is possible. Read more about the Mac Pro: Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop When? We think WWDC MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. When? We think never... MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having been released at the end of 2016, we don't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 latest rumours. When? We think October 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear at some point in 2017 - although there was no sign of it when Apple updated some of its products on 21 March. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that the new version might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. When? We think WWDC Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini rumours article. When? We think WWDC New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. No iMac updates were forthcoming on 21 March when Apple updated the iPad, but they may still appear. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, at WWDC we think, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. When? We think WWDC Read more in our new iMac rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Software & services 'Wireless mystery device' Recent photos reveal a mystery wireless device submitted to the FCC by Apple bearing the model number A1844. The mystery device, of course, caused huge stirs in the Apple community. The application claimed that it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and NFC wireless functionality. This led some to believe that it was either going to be a new, smaller Apple TV or possibly even an accessory for Apple Pay, allowing small businesses to accept wireless/Apple Pay payments. However, while we'd all hoped it'd be a cool new Apple device, further investigation seems to suggest that it's nothing more than a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for use in Apple's Apple Park HQ opening in April 2017. There's a snap of the wireless device above, but those that want more information can check out the full FCC filing here.  iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page. To refresh your memories on what Apple included in macOS 10.12 Sierra read more here: macOS Sierra new features and release date or watch the discussion video: Apple predictions for 2017: WatchOS 4 WatchOS is developing nicely and in 2017 we expect to see the introduction of Sleep Tracking, which would further bolster the fitness focus of the Apple Watch. No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we're not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren't the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it's now providing another entry ramp for the firm's £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can't necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

The mysterious XPoint memory in Intel’s new Optane solid-state drive is a step toward universal memory By Katherine Bourzac Posted 19 Apr 2017 | 18:00 GMT Advertisement Editor's Pick Inkjet-Printed Flexible Memory Devices Microsoft Sets DNA Data-Storage Record: 200 Megabytes Forever Data in Quartz: The Quest for the Immortal Bit Photo: Intel Learning to Drive: Intel’s Optane storage device is a zippier solid-state drive. Memory modules are next. Today’s computers shuttle data around a byzantine system of several different kinds of short- and long-term memory. No wonder, then, that engineers have long dreamed of one memory technology to rule them all, a universal memory that would simplify computing and streamline the path of data. In March, Intel announced that it will sell to data centers a new kind of solid-state drive, called Optane, that it says could lead to this kind of simplification. Optane drives are nonvolatile, like flash memory, which means that they should use relatively little standby power and that they’re fast, like DRAM. “It really starts to marry the worlds of memory and storage together,” company CEO Brian Krzanich says in a promotional video, over the swells of heroic music. The technology “comes close to being the holy grail of memory,” says Intel executive vice president William Holt in the same video. Whether 3D XPoint, the mystery technology inside Optane, can live up to this promise is likely to depend on the performance it delivers as well as Intel’s ability to scale up manufacturing using new materials and build out the right market. The 375-gigabyte Optane drive on offer now costs US $1,520, about three times the price of an equivalent solid-state drive. This first product will enable data centers to do more with a smaller number of servers, says James Myers, who works on nonvolatile memory architecture at Intel. Myers gives an example of servers running a MySQL database, which, among other things, apps use to store instant messages. An equivalent flash drive can perform 1,400 such transactions per second; the Optane drive can perform over 16,000. The Optane drive was announced with bombast, but the company is coy about the technology behind it. Myers says “3D” refers to the fact that the memory cells are stacked; “XPoint” alludes to the way the memory elements are arranged. While flash memory elements must be read and written in groups, XPoint elements—situated at the crossing point of interconnects—can be addressed individually. Myers says that this architecture, and something inherent to the storage materials themselves, makes 3D XPoint faster than flash memory. Intel, which initially developed 3D XPoint in conjunction with Micron, won’t say what the technology really is, but this doesn’t seem to bother researchers or analysts. “Everyone seems to think it’s phase-change memory,” says semiconductor analyst Jim Handy. “I don’t care.” What matters to him—and, Intel hopes, its customers—is the performance. The complexity of today’s memory hierarchy—a combination that often includes magnetic disks and flash for storage and DRAM and static RAM for memory—is a necessary evil. Each technology has its own strengths, so they must be combined. Data are shuttled around from speedy but expensive SRAM caches—which are close to the processor and embedded within it—to slower, less expensive (but still pricey) DRAM. Finally, data are stored in slow but reliable flash or hard-disk drives, or both. Even if it’s not possible to do it all in one memory technology, using only one for working memory close to the processor and one for longer-term storage would help simplify things. Intel says that XPoint memory could provide a speedier alternative to flash memory and magnetic hard disks. The company has also suggested it could supplement or supplant DRAM. “DRAM is unique in its ability to waste power, so anything you can do to get rid of it is great,” says Handy. For example, Google is thought to store the index of the entire Internet on several power-hungry, quick-access DRAM servers. If the company could switch this over to 3D XPoint—which Intel claims has 10 times the density of DRAM—Google could use fewer servers and thus save power and money, according to Steven ­Swanson, a computer scientist at the University of California, San Diego. Intel is providing software that will enable computers to operate Optane as memory as opposed to storage, but it will be slow. Optane drive latencies max out at 7 or 8 microseconds—way faster than flash, which takes hundreds of microseconds, but not touching DRAM’s low hundreds of nanoseconds. The Optane drives are fettered by the interface they use: They connect to the storage interface, not the memory interface. In the short term, Intel’s drives are not likely to replace any existing memory technologies but will instead supplement them, says Swanson, who built a research drive based on the company’s 3D XPoint technology in 2011. Swanson expects the path to memory and storage simplification to be complex because computing systems will have to be redesigned to route data in new ways. Swanson and Handy believe Intel started with storage to help smooth out some of the risk in launching a new memory technology. Making Optane a memory requires new circuit board designs and cooperation from programmers. To get those, Intel needs to show that there is a market for 3D XPoint and demonstrate its reliability. Intel says that a product using a memory interface will be out in 2018. Even using the interface, 3DXPoint still won’t be quite as fast as DRAM, but Intel promises that it will be denser and less expensive. The success of this new memory, then, will hinge on data centers taking it up in a less than ideal initial form while the company works on scaling up production. Even though the flaws in today’s memory and storage hierarchy are universally acknowledged, trying to change it is a risky move. “Almost all memory companies have one or two potential competitors to this technology, and they’re all waiting to see what happens before they jump into [a] big investment,” says Swanson. Memory enthusiasts disagree about whether a true universal memory is even physically possible. It is perhaps most useful as a goal to guide the computer industry forward. “The concept of the universal memory is attractive because the idea is to simplify,” says Wei Lu, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan and chief scientist at Crossbar, a resistive RAM startup company. “We have a big-data problem, and today’s computers are fundamentally not good at this.” This article appears in the May 2017 print issue as “Has Intel Created a Universal Memory Technology?” Advertisement Recommended For You Trump’s Plans Could Scuttle New Hybrid Car Tech in U.S. Three Computer Games That Make Assembly Language Fun Kees Immink: The Man Who Put Compact Discs on Track Whose Drone Was That Anyway?

Published on April 21, 2017. 0 When we talk about industry rivalry, we cannot overlook one of the two oldest competitors on the CPU market, namely Intel and AMD. They have been fighting to get everybody’s attention ever since the ‘60s, and gamers, PC users, manufacturers and enthusiasts. And it seems that they’re not planning to stop anytime soon. We chose two of their best products to stack up against one another: AMD Ryzen 7 and Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake. Different Architectures While the latest Ryzen chip relies on a Zen microarchitecture which is built on a 14 nm FinFET process and an innovative AM4 socket, the most recent Core i7 CPU works on the Kaby Lake architecture. The latter is also using a 14 nm technology, plus fast CPU speeds and higher Turbo frequencies than it offered until now. Families and Specs The Ryzen model imitates the structure of the Intel chip families when it comes both to name and performance skews. As an example, the AMD Ryzen 7 line rivals the Intel Core i7 model, the Ryzen 5 pairs up against the Intel Core i5 and lastly, the Ryzen 3 matches the Core i3. Ryzen is a 1800X processor and an octacore one, which can support 16 threads being executed. The base clock is a 3.6 GHz one and you can boost it up to 4 GHz. Meanwhile, the i7 is a 7700 K one, which has a 4.2 GHz speed, being a four core device with 8 MB cache. People’s Impressions When it comes to performance, many people think that Intel is better than the AMD. The preliminary benchmark tests made on the two processors showed that the Ryzen model is slightly less performant than the Intel product. However, their advantage is the fact that the Ryzens are overclockable, thus achieving greater speeds.

The Waymo driverless car is displayed during a Google event last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world’s biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG’s Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp. acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-21. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. “Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming, and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact.  Others such as General Motors Co. are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive PLC are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp. has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc., competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house — as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology.

But this strategy was always a little riskier than many assumed, both due to how financially important Intel's PC CPU business remains and because it was unfurled just as AMD (AMD) was getting ready to launch CPUs that put it on much better footing in the high-end and mid-range segments than it has been for many years. Now it looks as if Intel is rethinking its stance a little, even if doing so will probably lead to some near-term margin pressure. Taiwan's Digitimes, which appears to have good sources at local PC contract manufacturers and motherboard makers, reported on Wednesday that Intel plans to unveil its new high-end Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X high-end CPUs -- part of a new platform called Basin Falls -- at the Computex trade show, which runs in Taipei from May 30 to June 3. Prior reports had pointed to an August launch. Digitimes also states the first CPUs based on Intel's Coffee Lake architecture, the successor to the Kaby Lake architecture launched last fall, will debut in August. It adds the Coffee Lake launch is being pulled in January 2018, but Intel previously indicated Coffee Lake would arrive by this holiday season. The report comes about six weeks after AMD launched its high-end Ryzen 7 desktop CPUs, based on its new Zen CPU core architecture. Benchmarks showed AMD's flagship Ryzen 7 1800X chip ($499 MSRP) holding its own against Intel's Core i7-6900K (based on the older Broadwell architecture, $1,089 recommended price) in many tests. The 1800X did lag the 6900K, as well as Intel's Core i7-7700K (based on Kaby Lake, $339 recommended price), in many 1080p-resolution gaming benchmarks, but was more competitive in higher-resolution gaming tests for which GPU power matters more. AMD recently followed up on the Ryzen 7 launch by rolling out its mid-range Ryzen 5 desktop CPUs. With 6 cores and the ability to handle 12 simultaneous threads, AMD's Ryzen 5 1600X ($249 MSRP) often trounces Intel's Kaby Lake-based Core i5-7600K (4 cores and threads, $242 to $243 recommended price) in productivity and content-creation benchmarks. Moreover, the Ryzen 5 line provides a level of overclocking support that Intel's mid-range offerings generally lack. 1080p gaming is again a soft spot at times, but less so when a game has been optimized for Ryzen (Ashes of the Singularity saw about a 20% performance improvement in 1800X tests after being optimized) and/or uses Microsoft's (MSFT)  DirectX 12 programming interfaces, which can take better advantage of the 1600X's extra cores. That bodes well for the competitiveness of Ryzen CPUs in general in future gaming tests, including the 16-core desktop CPU AMD reportedly plans to launch in August and the notebook processors due at some point in the second half of the year. Intel already appears to be cutting prices below "recommended" levels for some high-end desktop parts in an effort to counter AMD. And the performance gains that Basin Falls and Coffee Lake should respectively deliver over the Broadwell and Kaby Lake CPUs they'll gradually replace should give Intel a little more breathing room in the face of AMD's aggressive pricing. Microsoft could also aid Intel's efforts to fend off AMD, not to mention lift PC upgrade rates, particularly in the corporate market. Redmond has been baking features into Windows 10 that can only be leveraged by Intel CPUs based on Skylake or a newer architecture. Security and performance-optimization features were shown off in 2015, and this week Microsoft unveiled an upcoming Windows 10 feature for newer Intel-based systems that it claims can lower CPU power draw by up to 11% by limiting how much power background apps can use. But even if Intel's more aggressive PC stance pays off, there will likely be a cost attached. In February, the company forecast its PC CPU R&D spend would drop about 5% from 2015 to 2017. With the company significantly upping its data center, flash memory and IoT R&D spend over this time, and also planning to hike its capital spending this year to $12 billion (plus or minus $500 million) from a 2016 level of $9.5 billion, cuts in PC R&D, marketing and manufacturing process investments are a key part of Intel's strategy to grow profits during a time of limited top-line growth. Speeding up the Basin Falls and Coffee Lake launches will presumably require some extra R&D spend. And if Intel also speeds up the production ramp for its Cannonlake CPUs -- the first PC CPUs based on Intel's next-gen 10-nanometer manufacturing process -- to counter AMD, that will also require some extra capex. It could also ding gross margin for a while since chips based on newer manufacturing processes tend to initially have lower yields. The first Cannonlake CPUs are expected in late 2017 or early 2018. AMD is expected to rely on 14-nanometer processes for Ryzen until 2019, when 7-nanometer chips based on a new "Zen Plus" CPU core architecture are forecast to arrive. There's a lot at stake for Intel. The company's Client Computing Group (responsible for PC and mobile processors) accounted for 52% of its 2016 revenue, and together with the Data Center Group (responsible for server CPUs, among other things) produced nearly all of its 2016 operating profits. After 12 months of talking endlessly about how it's becoming a "post-PC" company, and making some splashy acquisitions to aid that transformation, Intel might finally be realizing how much it has to lose if its treats its PC business as a "legacy" operation in the face of a resurgent AMD. The solid work that AMD has done with Ryzen, together with its undercutting of Intel's high-margin products, still leaves it well-positioned to take share. But Intel -- for a price -- might be poised to limit the damage. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money. Click the "+Follow" next to my byline to this article.

Woah, we have just received confirmation from Benchlife.info that Intel is going forward with the 12-Core Skylake-X part after all. This is pretty big news which I had previously published as a rumor. Meanwhile, the launch of the company’s X299 platform is going to happen at Computex 2017 as previously stated. It will be unveiled at the Intel Keynote by Navin Shenoy who is the General Manager and Senior Vice President of Client Computing Group (CCG). Intel’s response to Ryzen: Rolling out 12-Core Skylake-X HEDT chip under the X299 platform on 30th May Benchlife has also revealed the mass availability date for the platform, which is going to be on 26th of June 2017. This means the Basin Falls will be shipping with not 4 but 5 SKUs. The five SKUs will include a 12 core, 10 core, 8 core, 6 core and 4 core model. The 12, 10, 8 and 6 core models will be based on Skylake architecture. The 4 core model will be based on the Kaby Lake architecture which launched on mainstream platforms earlier this month. All Skylake-X chips will feature a rated TDP of 140W (with the possible exception of the 12-Core die) while the Kaby Lake-X chip will feature a TDP of 112W. All chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors and utilize the LGA 2066 socket. Related Report: Intel Has Pushed Forward Basin Falls, Skylake-X and Coffee Lake To Tackle Newly Competitive x86 Landscape The LGA 2066 socket of the HEDT Basin Falls platform is called Socket R4. SKL-X will have up to 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 68 lanes) while Kaby Lake-X will have only up to 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 40 lanes). Skylake-X will have quad channel DDR 4 memory up to 2667MHz in 1DPC mode and up to 2400MHz in 2DPC mode. Kabylake-X on the other hand will only have dual channel DDR4. The Kaby Lake PCH will have 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 8 SATA Gen3, 10 USB 3.0 ports and connected via 4 DMI 3.0 lanes to the processor. Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) will also be present on the chipset. Advertisement This move is something that can be categorized as unprecedented from Intel and can be cautiously allocated  as a reaction to AMD’s Ryzen. Or more specifically the looming threat of bigger and faster Ryzen processors with even more cores in bound. Remember that word on the grapevine is that AMD is planning on releasing its 16-core Ryzen CPU and the X399 platform in the 3rd quarter of 2017 for the gaming market. If such a thing should happen, it would turn the tables on Intel, which will need to revamp its lineup in order to compete with the sheer number of cores that AMD will be throwing at it. According to the source, the 14nm Coffeelake processors and its Z370 chipset will be releasing in August as well as more CPUs and the H370 and B360/H310 chipsets following at the end of 2017 or early 2018. There is also one very obvious implication in all this: that Intel will be cutting prices for the price points across the board as well. Microcenter has already started cutting prices, but as of yet there is no word from Intel on an official price cut. It is possible that Intel will introduce the new set of price cuts with the new Skylake-X lineup and has currently adopted a wait-and-see strategy, which would make a lot of sense. Related Intel’s X299 HEDT Platform with LGA 2066 Socket Codenamed ‘Basin Falls’ – Launch Pushed Forward to Computex 2017 in June The x86 battleground has been silent for far too long and things are obviously starting to heat up for both companies. Armed with the flexible Zen architecture, AMD makes a formidable opponent thanks to their value proposition of perf per $. Not only can they now match Intel in terms of core count (remember, 16 Naples dies can be re-purposed for the commercial space if AMD sees fit) but are in the same league in terms of performance per core as well. Intel will need to accompany this 12-core reveal with a price cut for maximum effect but regardless of how much $s Intel shaves off the MSRP, one thing is clear: The Game Is On.

It's the end of another week, filled with all sorts of thrilling announcements, spicy rumors, and delightful details from all over the tech world. As ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you're up to date with what's been happening. Our journey begins this week with Intel, which has announced the end of its Developer Forum, after almost two decades. AMD launched its new Radeon RX 500 family of graphics cards, built on the same 14nm Polaris architecture as last year's RX 400 series. In fact, they're so similar that an RX 480 can be upgraded to an RX 580 with a BIOS flash. Juicero attracted widespread derision for its $400 'smart juicer', which does little more than squeeze pre-made organic fruit and vegetable juices out of a bag and into a cup. The company is now offering refunds to buyers after it was pointed out that the same job could be done by hand. Good grief. Plastc, which aimed to offer a new type of credit card - that stored multiple card details on a single unit, and featured an e-ink display - shut down operations this week. Audio specialist Bose is facing a lawsuit, which claims that it collected users' audio histories, and shared that data with marketing companies along with personally identifiable data, alleging violation of the Wiretap Act and privacy laws. Facebook held its F8 developer conference this week, where it made a variety of announcements: Facebook wants to eventually replace passwords, starting with Delegated Account Recovery Two-new 360-degree cameras improve Facebook's focus on VR Research project aims to read your thoughts, and help people hear through their skin Can't wait to examine the privacy implications of that project. Mozilla released Firefox 53, ending support for older versions of Windows, adding new UI options, and introducing the new Quantum Compositor engine, which handles page rendering in a separate process. Perhaps the most surprising news of the week was about Firefox's biggest rival, Chrome. Google - which makes nearly all of its money from selling online ads - is reportedly planning to build its own ad-blocker into Chrome... but that's not quite as mad as it first seems. Google made its Home speaker hub a lot more useful, as it added multi-user support, using voice recognition to offer personalized features for up to six people. Google also launched a new version of Earth, its global exploration platform, introducing a range of features to help users learn more about our planet, and see it from all sorts of new perspectives. Weeks later than planned, Verizon said that its 4G-connected Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch, the Wear24, will finally be available next month. Google's Android Wear 2.0 rollout has been a bit of a mess. The company said that it will finally make its way to the last set of eligible devices by the end of May. The rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat hasn't been much better. Eight months after Google released that update, it's still slowly making its way to various devices: HTC One A9 in India Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge in India Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 and 9.7 in the US Google's Android security updates have also been rolling out to more devices: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge on T-Mobile US (March update) Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 (April update) Samsung Galaxy S8+ in Europe (April update) ...and Google mistakenly pushed a "confidential internal" Android security update to some Pixel XL handsets. Oops. It hasn't been the best of weeks for Google's devices. It emerged that many Pixel and Pixel XL owners have been complaining of problems with backing up their data for months. Some Pixel and Nexus owners reported issues with the fingerprint sensors on their devices after installing the Android 7.1.2 update. And Google is also facing a class action lawsuit over bootloop and battery issues on its Nexus 6P. Samsung's new Galaxy S8 flagships, which are launching this month around the world, have also been making headlines in recent days: Users report a 'red hue' on their Galaxy S8 and S8+ displays Samsung is now preventing users from remapping the physical Bixby digital assistant button Galaxy S8 and S8+ get teardown treatment Galaxy S8 gets scratched, subjected to flames and a bend test Galaxy S8's battery survives being sliced and stabbed; spares the fireworks After it emerged that some owners of Huawei's new P10 and P10 Plus flagships were seeing wildly different memory performance on their devices, Huawei admitted that it has used a variety of memory chips on the handsets, but insists that it has not misled customers. Xiaomi unveiled its new top-of-the-line Mi 6 handset, featuring some killer specs at incredibly competitive prices. The device has a 5.15-inch screen, and uses Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor with 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage, priced from just $360. Sharp announced its new Aquos R, a compact flagship that also uses the Snapdragon 835. It features a 5.3-inch Quad HD display too, along with a 22.6MP camera, 4GB RAM, and 64GB storage. After seemingly endless leaks, HTC confirmed that its new U flagship will be unveiled on May 16. The device - which features touch-sensitive bezels - will be revealed just two months after its last flagship, the U Ultra, went on sale. Microsoft released a new beta of its Arrow Launcher for Android devices, bringing a range of minor, but useful new features. Microsoft also released a preview of its new "intelligent task management app" for Android phones, iPhones and Windows 10 devices. Promising a "smarter, more personal and intuitive way to help people stay organized", and integrated with Office 365, Microsoft To-Do will eventually replace Wunderlist, which the company acquired almost two years ago. Microsoft is also attempting to simplify two-factor authentication for those signing in to Microsoft accounts, enabling them to do so without a password, using its Authenticator app on iOS and Android... but not on Windows phones. What a surprise. Apple released its third developer betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5 Sierra, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. Apple also accidentally emailed hundreds of employees with a copy of a document that detailed workplace injuries to some of its staff, and which included possible hints at the company's future products. One incident referred to a user who "experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points" after testing an unknown prototype. Microsoft has been using iris-scanning technology for some time as part of its Windows Hello biometric authentication platform, but the company has now patented an enhanced version of that technology would could be used in future devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft is working with the UK's Lloyds Banking Group to enable customers of Lloyds Bank, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland to use Windows Hello fingerprint scanning and facial recognition when accessing their accounts. Expanding on its collaboration with Twist Bioscience and the University of Washington, Microsoft is acquiring another ten million strands of DNA to explore its potential for use in data storage. Microsoft is also acquiring Intentional Software, a company co-founded in 2002 by Charles Simonyi, one of its most distinguished former employees. Simonyi was a key figure in the development of Word and Excel, but left Microsoft to develop the Intentional Programming paradigm, which Microsoft is now interested in commercializing to help 'reinvent productivity'. Visual Studio 2017 Preview 15.2 was released this week, bringing various improvements and fixes for the developer community. Microsoft also announced a series of updates to Azure Analysis Services, its Online Analytics Processing engine, including improved integration with Active Directory, new pricing options, and more. Fujitsu unveiled a new range of Windows 10 PCs and tablets for enterprise, including one with a new 'Slide Passport' authentication system that will "read and authenticate the pattern of veins in your hand". And HP showed off its new family of mobile workstations, offering powerful performance and enterprise-class security. After unveiling its Galaxy Book at Mobile World Congress in February, Samsung announced details of pricing and availability in the US this week. The 10.6-inch Windows 10 tablet will be priced from $629.99, while the 12-inch model - which includes a 4G LTE option - will be available from $1,129.99. You can get a quick overview of the Galaxy Book 10.6" and 12" in our hands-on video. The Eve V, which the company's CEO described as a 'Surface killer' in an interview with Neowin last year, will go into production next week, and begin shipping from next month. The crowdsourced, crowdfunded device is similar in concept to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, but features the latest 7th-generation Intel processors, USB-C ports, and a keyboard that can be used without being physically connected to the device. Microsoft released new firmware for its Surface Pro 3 tablet, promising an improvement in system stability and performance "when you change between power states". Microsoft also released an update for its Surface Studio, allowing owners of the high-end Windows 10 all-in-one to wake the device simply by saying "Hey Cortana". Photos emerged of a prototype Lumia Windows device with ultra-slim bezels, running Windows Phone 8.1 - but it wasn't destined to be a high-end handset. Had that device been released, it probably wouldn't have had much impact on the dwindling fortunes of Microsoft's mobile platform. As Windows' share of the global smartphone market has all but disappeared, Microsoft recently announced plans to sell Samsung's Galaxy S8 Android flagship in its US stores. But it's not just happening in the US. In China, the Microsoft Store has now started selling the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus - and as with the Galaxy S8, it will come preloaded with Microsoft's apps. Months behind iOS and Android, Microsoft launched its Flow beta app for "Windows Phones" a couple of weeks ago. The app now appears to be out of beta, but Microsoft has since edited its earlier announcement to clarify that it's only for Windows 10 Mobile devices with at least 2GB of RAM. Over a week after OneDrive users reported problems syncing their files to and from Windows phones, the problem was resolved a few days ago. Next week, Microsoft will begin rolling out its Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update - but as it recently confirmed, just 13 handsets will officially be able to install that update, as the company is dropping support for older devices. Unsurprisingly, that outraged many Windows phone owners, but their anger deepened when Microsoft apparently disabled its Upgrade Advisor app, preventing any Windows Phone 8.1 device from upgrading to Windows 10 - including those devices that were previously eligible. But on Tuesday, the app started working again - and according to Microsoft's Jason Howard, the reason it stopped working in the first place was due to a "bug". It's not surprising that so many people assumed Microsoft had simply terminated that upgrade path, given its decision to end support for so many devices, and the fact that it recently split off Windows 10 Mobile from its main Redstone 3 development branch into a separate 'feature2' branch. After releasing build 15204 last week, Microsoft rolled out Windows 10 Mobile 'feature2' preview build 15205 to the Fast ring on Wednesday. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. On the same day, it released Windows 10 Redstone 3 preview build 16179 for PCs in the Fast ring. Microsoft previously made it clear that its early RS3 builds would focus on structural improvements to OneCore, so while there's not much in the way of new features, there are some fixes and known issues to be aware of. Also on Wednesday, Microsoft revealed that it had reintroduced Power Throttling in its most recent RS3 builds for PCs. That feature optimizes CPU usage to boost battery life on portable devices, such as tablets and notebooks. The next day, Microsoft revealed that its Redstone 3 update will be released in September, and said that the company is now aligning Windows 10's two-updates-per-year release cadence with Office 365 ProPlus. Microsoft announced further changes to Office 365 ProPlus, including extended support for each feature update, revisions to system requirements, and a range of new tools to help manage application compatibility. Next month, Microsoft is hosting an event at which it's expected to formally announce its new Windows 10 Cloud edition. 'Recommended minimum specifications' for devices running that new version of the OS were revealed this week. In December, Microsoft announced that it would bring the full version of Windows 10 to devices with next-generation ARM processors, capable of running x86 apps through emulation. Qualcomm's CEO said this week that 'Mobile PC' devices with its Snapdragon 835 chips are scheduled to launch in the fourth quarter of 2017. Microsoft is adding new features to its Windows 10 Mail and Calendar apps for Gmail users, which were previously available only for those who used Outlook and Office 365. The Xbox Insider Hub app, previously exclusive to Xbox One consoles, is coming to Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft announced details of its next update, Version 1705, for the Xbox One and One S, including several fan-requested features. The latest build, 15063.3022, is now available for Xbox Insiders in the Alpha Ring. The latest Xbox Games with Gold were revealed, which will include Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II next month. Two years after its PC debut, Cities: Skylines is now available on the Xbox One. You can see the launch trailer for the Xbox One edition here. Halo Wars: Definitive Edition was released on Thursday as a standalone purchase for the Xbox One, and for PCs via the Windows Store and Steam. A new racing mode is coming to Grand Theft Auto Online, which will be familiar to those who played GTA back in the ol' days. The top-down view in Tiny Racers will be a nostalgia-fuelled thrill ride for many players, and frankly, it looks like enormous fun - make sure you check out the launch trailer here. It's official: the next instalment in the hugely popular Call of Duty series will take the series back to its World War II roots - and we'll learn more about the new game next week. The official trailer for Star Wars Battlefront II was released this week, ahead of the game's release on November 17. That's a long time to wait...! Sony announced on Tuesday that it will now be offering double the storage on its PlayStation 4 Slim in the US and Canada, for the same price of $299.99. Until now, the console has only been available in North America with 500GB of storage. Our odyssey across the tech world ends on a note of excitement - particularly after last week's disappointment, when Nintendo confirmed that it was no longer making its wonderful NES Classic Edition console. But as it turns out, it might just be preparing to launch a new version of the SNES... Squeeeee!

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: nSeika Hack lets older Windows users get around Windows 10 update restriction Chris Smith @chris_writes April 20th, 2017 at 6:29 PM Share Tweet Microsoft keeps saying that it’s not going to be as aggressive about Windows 10 upgrades as it used to be, but actions speak louder than words. Recently, users discovered that they were not able to receive the latest security updates on their Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 PCs that are powered by newer Intel chips. Microsoft issued a new tool that checks a computer’s processor and prevents it from receiving any updates in case it detects it’s a new generation CPU on a computer running a Windows version that’s not Windows 10. As expected, someone was able to crack Microsoft’s restrictions and re-enable updates. Don't Miss: Niantic is finally addressing Pokemon Go’s biggest problem Both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are still supported. We’re looking at three and six years of updates, respectively. But Microsoft would rather have you upgrading that new PC to the latest version of Windows 10. One way to convince you to pull the trigger is trying to prevent your laptop from receiving system updates meant to keep your PC safe. To be fair, Microsoft did warn Windows users about what’s coming. New Intel chips won’t support older Windows versions, Microsoft said all the way back in 2016. However, when Patch Tuesday came last week, and Windows 10 Creators Update along with it, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users discovered they were not able to receive their security updates. Microsoft’s tool was already in place giving an error message that read “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” One Windows user took it upon himself to fix this issue, ZDNet reports. Developer Zeffy posted a new patch on GitHub that stops Microsoft’s tool from checking your computer’s processor age. That means any Kaby Lake or Bristol Ridge Ryzen users can install the security updates for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 after using this unofficial patch. According to the developer, Microsoft’s March 16 update for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 came with this changelog entry: “Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update.” As Zeffy put it, that’s “essentially a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10”. You can get Zeffy’s fix at this link.

The list was compiled by documenting 260 data points of disclosure and performance measures for the Russell 1000, with data taken from publicly available information. CR Magazine’s research team looked at how companies handled climate change, environment, employee relations, human rights, corporate governance, financial performance and philanthropy/community support. CR Magazine notes that this year: 38 companies rose an average of 15 ranks. 15 companies in the top 100 fell an average of 14 ranks. The average rank increase for the Top 10 was 12 places. 13 companies are new to the list in 2017 that were not on the 2016 list. Five companies were dropped from the list based on negative CSR events within the last year: Johnson & Johnson, Merck, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours, Monsanto, and Dow Chemical. Six companies were noted as “cautioned” but remain on the list this year. Hasbro says that some of its efforts that helped the company rise to number one on the list include its initiatives in responsibly sourcing its materials. Hasbro says the company: ensures that all third-party factories producing Hasbro product are pre-qualified and only source products from qualified factories; ensures comprehensive factory monitoring that identifies areas of non-compliance and timely remediation; drives for transparency and communication throughout the supply chain; and engages with strategic stakeholders to further inform its approach to improving workplace conditions. Hasbro rose to number one on the list for the first time this year; it is the third year the company has been named in the top five.   Categories Environmental Management, FeatureTags Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR The EHS Guidebook: Selecting, Implementing, and Using EHS Software Solutions Sponsored By: EtQ    Video: Expense & Data Management for Complex Payables Sponsored By: Ecova, Inc.    The New Energy Future - Challenges and Opportunities in Corporate Energy Management Sponsored By: Edison Energy    eBook: Driving Visibility and Harmonization in EHS Practices Sponsored By: Sphera Solutions    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Report: Intel Has Pushed Forward Basin Falls, Skylake-X and Coffee Lake To Tackle Newly Competitive x86 Landscape By Usman Pirzada Apr 19, 2017 53Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel's Skylake-X platform promises to introduce the first ever 10-core SKU for the Mainstream/HEDT segment. It looks like another source has come forward, confirming the news story we originally published from Benchlife.info. This report stems from Digitimes and reaffirms the same thing as well as some additional details, lending credence to the fact that Intel has actually pushed its unveiling ahead of schedule. This is actually something that might make sense, given the fact that the company has cancelled the IDF event, which is clear evidence of a shakeup happening right now in the company’s traditional lineup. Intel pushed forward Basin Falls and Coffee Lake; meanwhile, AMD is planning on releasing a 16 core Ryzen variant Interestingly, Digitimes also mentions that AMD is planning on releasing its 16-core Ryzen CPU and the X399 platform in the 3rd quarter of 2017 for the gaming market. If such a thing should happen, it would turn the tables on Intel, which will need to revamp its lineup in order to compete with the sheer number of cores that AMD will be throwing at it. According to the source, the 14nm Coffeelake processors and its Z370 chipset will be releasing in August as well as more CPUs and the H370 and B360/H310 chipsets following at the end of 2017 or early 2018. Related Intel’s Monstrous 12 Core / 24 Thread HEDT Skylake-X Processor Confirmed – Will Debut On 30th May In Intel Keynote, Availability By End of June There is also a nugget of information for the industry enthusiast, Intel has apparently payed up $100 million to buy 5 EUV scanners from ASML, which indicates that it is accelerating work on Extreme UV lithography which is supposed to pave the way to 10nm and beyond (while staying on silicon). Benchlife claims the release of Intel’s brand new processors is going to happen by Computex this year – and they have a very good reason for doing so as we will soon see. The event is going to be held from May 31 to June 3, and it looks like Intel is planning on launching the brand new Basin Falls X299 platform at that time. Advertisement Overview of Intel’s X299 HEDT platform codenamed Basin Falls. The HEDT launch lineup will include at least four SKUs that will make their way to the X299 platform. All processors will utilize the 14nm process node, however, the Kaby Lake-X chips may have a slight edge due to the process optimizations. This would result in better clock speeds with reduced power consumption, adding to the efficiency. The four SKUs will include a 10 core, 8 core, 6 core and 4 core model. The 10, 8 and 6 core models will be based on Skylake architecture. The 4 core model will be based on the Kaby Lake architecture which launched on mainstream platforms earlier this month. All Skylake-X chips will feature a rated TDP of 140W while the Kaby Lake-X chip will feature a TDP of 112W. All chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors and utilize the LGA 2066 socket. The LGA 2066 socket of the HEDT Basin Falls platform is called Socket R4. SKL-X will have up to 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 68 lanes) while Kaby Lake-X will have only up to 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 40 lanes). Skylake-X will have quad channel DDR 4 memory up to 2667MHz in 1DPC mode and up to 2400MHz in 2DPC mode. Kabylake-X on the other hand will only have dual channel DDR4. The Kaby Lake PCH will have 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 8 SATA Gen3, 10 USB 3.0 ports and connected via 4 DMI 3.0 lanes to the processor. Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) will also be present on the chipset. Related Intel’s X299 HEDT Platform with LGA 2066 Socket Codenamed ‘Basin Falls’ – Launch Pushed Forward to Computex 2017 in June A rumor that stems from Bitsandchips.it, a publication that has proved to be fairly reliable in the past, suggests that the company might be taking the high road to tackling Ryzen. It has already promised to include 10 core Skylake variants in its high end lineup (Skylake-X) but if this report is true then it means we could be looking at a massive, 12 core/24 thread die as well. Assuming Intel is actually preparing a 12 core variant to include in the Skylake-X lineup then that means that you are actually looking at a lineup shakeup. Instead of the 6 and 8 core high end parts, we will be looking at 6, 8, 10 and 12 core parts. There is also one very obvious implication in all this, that Intel will be cutting prices across the board as well. Microcenter has already started cutting prices, but as of yet there is no word from Intel on an official price cut.

The hearings were initially scheduled to be held late last month but were canceled by committee chairman Devin Nunes at the last minute for reasons that are still unclear. Since then, Nunes, a California Republican, has recused himself from the investigation, which is looking into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government as well as leaks about the leaking of classified information about Trump advisers. With the investigation now under the control of Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, the committee sent letters this week to FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers inviting them to appear at a closed hearing on May 2. Former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates were also invited to appear at an open hearing after May 2. The latter hearing was the most contentious for Republicans and Democrats on the committee. Democrats, led by California Rep. Adam Schiff, wanted Brennan, Clapper and Yates to testify in order to shoot down Republican claims that the Obama administration conducted surveillance of the Trump team prior to the election.

Yates, who was fired by Trump in late January for refusing to comply with an executive order banning travel from certain Muslim-majority countries, claimed that the Trump administration was trying to block her from testifying about the investigation into links between the Kremlin and Trump campaign.

I look forward to it,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at a press briefing last month.

They all share a few common themes, though: creativity and security. HP also seems to have put effort into making these notebooks sleek and relatively lightweight, which will certainly be appreciated because no one wants a bulky and unattractive machine. If you need something with a high resolution display and long battery life, HP would like to draw your attention to the ZBook Studio. This notebook offers a 15-inch 4K display that’s equipped with HP DreamColor and supports Adobe RGB. You’ll have you choice of seventh-gen Intel Core i5, i7, or Xeon CPUs, and you can even tack on NVIDIA Quadro graphics if you need more power beyond Intel integrated graphics. The 4K display will likely be the main draw here, but HP also says that battery can last as long as 16.5 hours with some configurations. If power, on the other hand, is the most important thing, then there are the ZBook 15 or ZBook 17. In the ZBook 17 specifically, HP is giving Core i5 CPUs a pass entirely, offering only Core i7 or Xeon configurations. You still have the option of upgrading to discrete graphics if you so choose, but with these two, you’re not limited to just NVIDIA Quadro cards – you can select an AMD RadeonPro if that’s more your style. With some configurations, HP touts the ZBook 17 as a notebook that’s capable of supporting VR content at 90 fps. None of the other notebooks in this new group do that, so if you need a mobile workstation that can, this is certainly the one for you. While we’d normally think that you want a desktop to produce and play VR content, HP’s claims here are certainly intriguing. Finally, we come to the ZBook 14u – the smallest of the bunch and likely the one to pick if you want a more traditional Ultrabook experience. With a full HD 14-inch display, seventh-gen Intel Core CPUs, and options for up to 32GB of RAM and AMD FirePro graphics, you may not have as much power as you do with other notebooks in the line, but things should be quite speedy nonetheless. All of these come with third generation HP Sure Start security features, which grant your machine a self-healing BIOS and access to security features such as encryption, malware protection, and threat detection. In short, if HP is going to try to sell content creators on these notebooks, it hopes that the addition of HP Sure Start will give those creators a certain peace of mind when it comes to things like IP theft. The ZBook Studio, ZBook 15, and ZBook 17 are launching today and are available through HP’s website. ZBook Studio configurations begin at $1,399, while the ZBook 15 starts at $1,419. That leaves the ZBook 17 as the most expensive of the bunch, which has a starting price at $1,519. Those who want a ZBook 14u will have to wait a bit longer, as it won’t be arriving until summer, with pricing announced at a later date.

In an interview with Sputnik Germany, Swiss journalist Roman Berger commented on the issue. © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy US Intel Report: 'RT & Sputnik Are Being Accused of Doing Journalism'Berger believes that a balanced coverage of events based on facts is under threat. The former Tages-Anzeiger correspondent in Moscow and Washington is well acquainted with the problems that journalists working abroad have to face. According to him, high-quality journalism requires a sufficient number of correspondents on the spot. Moreover, these correspondents should live in the relevant region for as long as possible, because for a balanced coverage of events it is important to know local culture and living conditions. However, this approach is practically not applied today, the journalist complained. "A correspondent is sent to the scene like a parachutist; he is just dumped in the conflict region. But the problem is that these 'parachute' journalists do not know the local language and the region itself. The result is a poor coverage of events," Berger stated. Shortly before the dissolution of the USSR, Berger was sent to Moscow to work as a correspondent. Within a few years the political situation changed drastically, and Western media should have increased the number of local correspondents, but the opposite happened. "Every year, the number of Western correspondents in Moscow was declining. The West believed that the Cold War was over. At the same time, foreign correspondents were too expensive, and the Western media decided that they could do without them," Berger explained. This had a serious impact on the coverage of recent conflicts, taking place on the post-Soviet space. "I often visited Ukraine, and I saw very well how local events were covered. After the beginning of the conflict, journalists who had no idea about the country arrived there. They did not understand this country, so there were a lot of misinforming reports," Berger said. According to him, the Western press had to take into account Moscow's position and cover the events from both sides. © AP Photo/ Peter Macdiarmid, Pool Ex-UK Chancellor Defends 'Long History' of Mixing Journalism and Politics"I remember the headline — 'We must stop Putin.' This personalized, Putin-related coverage of events was a big mistake. A different position was rarely presented by the media; for example, there were no opinions of Russian experts that could make it clear to the readers that the world looks different from Moscow's perspective," the journalist stated. A similar situation occurred with regard to Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. Leading newspapers such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times did not believe in his victory and were simply taken by surprise. According to Berger, there is practically no balanced journalism in the US that takes into account different views on a certain problem. "Previously, there was a rule, according to which the media had to give a say to both sides. Ronald Reagan canceled it, and now, for example, Fox News can broadcast opinions which are not based on facts," Berger said. In his opinion, the working conditions in a modern newsroom have also changed. Previously, newspaper journalists had to prepare the issue within 24 hours, but now, when there are printed and online versions, the pressure on journalists has significantly increased. "I see how much pressure is put on journalists who must produce three, four, five stories a day to fulfill the norm. My former newspaper now even offers bonuses for plots that receive a large number of views. Of course, this is a very dangerous trend. The journalist is constantly under pressure and has to produce tempting stories as quickly as possible," the journalist concluded. ...

(AAPL) iPhone 8 Facing a Resurgent Samsung (SSNLF) View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has slowed down the pace of its CPU releases over the past several years, and now that strategy appears to be paying off. For rival Advanced Micros Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) … AMD took advantage of the situation to make a big push with its new Ryzen processors, and Intel is now feeling the heat. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr A report says the company has been forced to accelerate release of its new Basin Falls series CPUs by two months, with Coffee Lake chips being moved up even more. To achieve the rush move, INTC is reportedly spending big bucks to increase its manufacturing capacity. INTC Stock’s Slowing PC Processor Innovation With the global computer market declining for the fifth straight year, it’s not surprising that Intel took its foot off the gas in terms of new CPU development. Last year, the company ditched its “tick-tock” development model for one that stretched CPUs into three phases of development. Even earlier, it had begun to get complacent with releases. A prime example was the Broadwell CPUs. Scheduled for 2013, Intel didn’t get around to releasing them until September 2014 and even then, the line-up was staggered with nine months between the first mobile chips and availability of desktop CPUs. INTC was originally scheduled to release Cannon Lake, a new 10nm chip this year. But then it added Coffee Lake, based on the same 14nm process as three previous generations of chips. Coffee Lake will be the primary CPU aimed at mainstream PCs, and its release was pushed to 2018. Cannon Lake is still on track for 2017, but for low-power devices like ultrabooks. AMD Moves to Disrupt With Ryzen PC manufacturers don’t like being at the whims of Intel’s schedule. New models are sometimes delayed for months, waiting for new INTC chips. Consumers may be reluctant to buy a new PC that has a year-old CPU in it. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMac hasn’t been updated since 2015 and the blame is often placed with Intel for delayed CPU releases. Intel’s rival in the computer CPU business has not been sitting still. AMD is taking full advantage of INTCs strategy. It has released new Ryzen CPUs that are based on all-new Zen architecture, with improvements that go far beyond the modest gains Intel’s bumps have been providing. AMD Ryzen CPUs also emphasize multicore support, making them ideal for advanced uses like VR and 4K gaming. AMD has been trampled by Intel in the past, to the point where nearly 90% of PCs sold have “Intel Inside” stickers. But the new AMD Ryzen CPUs — which have been well received — could change that.

All recruits remember their first offer. All Oklahoma fans remember the first in-state offer for a particular class. For 2018? It was Moore Southmoore offensive tackle Brey Walker. Tulsa Booker T. Washington safety Daxton Hill earned the honors for 2019. http://www.scout.com/player/212491-andrew-raym?s=73 There’s not supposed to be a 2020 offer yet, but there is. Broken Arrow offensive tackle Andrew Raym became the initial offer for the Sooners in 2020 and also his first offer of many more to come. Raym projects at offensive tackle for the future and is around 6-foot-4 and 280 pounds following his freshman season. He was in Norman for Bedlam in December and returned to OU two weeks ago for the spring game when he earned the offer from offensive line coach Bill Bedenbaugh and defensive coordinator Mike Stoops. “It was pretty wild,” Raym said. “Pretty surreal. It’s exciting, and I truly feel blessed.” Raym was just checking in when Bedenbaugh and Stoops told him he no longer has to search for his first offer as OU was ready to make the plunge. Bedenbaugh has built one of the best offensive lines in the country for the 2017 season, and he’s doing his best to make sure it doesn’t slow down anytime soon in Norman. Where it used to be unheard of to offer a recruit so early, Bedenbaugh has shown that can work. He offered Walker in the spring following his freshman season and has now had the five-star committed to the Sooners since Bedlam 2015. Bedenbaugh is trying to do the same thing with Raym. “It’s a pretty good relationship right now,” Raym said. “He’s a really good coach, and you can tell he gets the best out of his players.” Bedenbaugh would like to do the same with Raym in the future, and OU fans have reason to be optimistic about that happening. Raym said he has grown up a huge Sooners fan, always been his favorite team. Raym also has had close ties with Arkansas so expect the Razorbacks to be in the mix as well. He said he might visit Texas A&M this summer. It can be incredibly difficult to be a freshman on varsity, especially at a position as grueling as offensive line. But Raym really didn’t see the big fuss about what he was able to accomplish. “It was pretty easy, honestly (the transition),” he said. “I’ve been working up to that moment my whole life. This is what I want to do.” At 6-4 right now, Raym said doctors have told him he should approach anywhere from 6-6 to 6-8. His size won’t be questioned, and he’s making sure his work ethic isn’t, either. “Honestly, I try to get in around 5-5:30 a.m. before school and work on my footwork,” Raym said. “I have a long way to go so I’m not going to slow down.”   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout 2019 OKPreps primer, Pt.

Although there are no current products in Apple’s lineup that support Thunderbolt 3, it’s widely assumed that such hardware, made possible by Intel’s Skylake microarchitecture, is in the pipeline. The folks over at Lacie, Promise, and CalDigit have all revealed new Thunderbolt 3 products at NAB 2016, bringing high bandwidth and high-capacity storage solutions to market. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? What is Thunderbolt 3? Thunderbolt 3 is the latest generation of the Thunderbolt hardware interface, and the direct successor to Thunderbolt 2. There are several differences between Thunderbolt 3 and previous generations, but the most obvious difference is the connector type. Previous generations used the miniDisplay Port connector, while Thunderbolt 3 uses USB-C. More importantly, Thunderbolt combines DisplayPort and PCI express into one serial signal, while providing DC power in a single cable. This means that, in theory, it’s possible to both power and connect a Thunderbolt 3-equipped machine to the rest of the peripherals that you need using a single cable. With Thunderbolt 3, bandwidth has been doubled to 40Gbps vs Thunderbolt 2’s 20Gbps. The controller also supports HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 protocols for the ability to daisy chain dual 4K monitors at 60Hz. Needless to say, Thunderbolt 3 is a uber-promising interface that serves as the basis for the following hardware products announced today at NAB. Lacie Lacie, who is no stranger to Mac workflows big and small, revealed its 12big Thunderbolt 3 12-Bay Desktop RAID storage solution. The all aluminum enclosure features the same high design standards that we’ve come to expect from Lacie. Not only is this unit ridiculously fast, with up to 2600MB/s transfer speeds, and 2400MB/s speeds in RAID 5, but it also features an obscene amount of storage capacity. Loaded with 12 7200 RPM enterprise-class Seagate drives for a record-setting 96TB of storage, the 12big Thunderbolt 3 features a vast amount of storage space that is perfect for professional workflows. The drives are designed to operate 24×7 and are rated for 8760 hours of operation per year. For a system that ships with so many drives, you’re probably wondering about the warranty included with this setup. The 12big comes with a five-year limited warranty that covers all of the drives, the enclosure and spare parts. With this being a RAID-protected setup, Lacie has redesigned its RAID manager to offer a more intuitive interface to help administer the 12big. Users can put the RAID manager to work to assist with initial setup and storage monitoring. It also allows for advanced features like auto rebuild, drive diagnostics and CPU settings. Along with dual Thunderbolt 3 ports, the unit also features a USB 3.1-enabled USB-C port for added flexibility. Read more about Lacie’s big announcement via its press release. CalDigit T8 Extreme Thunderbolt 3 RAID CalDigit announced two new Thunderbolt 3 products today at NAB, starting with the T8 Extreme Thunderbolt 3 RAID, an 8-bay storage solution that can support both 2.5″ and 3.5″ drives. The T8 features capacities of 48TB with 3.5″ traditional spinning disks, or 8TB with using 2.5″ SSDs. CalDigit says that the T8 features speeds of up to 1440MB/s with SSDs. The T8 bay features support for RAID 0,1, 5, 6, or JBOD, and features dual Thunderbolt 3 ports for up to 40Gb/s bandwidth. The T8 also sports a full sized DisplayPort input on its rear, allowing for a quick and easy 4K 60Hz monitor setup. T4 Thunderbolt 3 The original T4 RAID featured Thunderbolt 2, but it’s receiving a Thunderbolt 3-centric update featured dual USB-C ports with 40Gb/s performance. Like the T8, the T4 features a full-sized DisplayPort connector on its rear for connecting a 4K monitor. The T4 features support for RAID 0, 1, 5 and JBOD. The bay comes in 24TB (HDD) or 4TB (SSD) varieties with hot-swappable drive bays. The updated T4 features transfer speeds up to 1440MB/s with SSD drives. If you’re looking for what will doubtlessly be a more affordable Thunderbolt 3 drive bay solution in a more compact form-factor, then the T4 is an interesting proposition. Pricing for either product has yet to be confirmed, but we’re hoping to hear more details soon. Check out CalDigit’s full press release for additional information. Promise Last, but certainly not least, the folks at Promise showed off some intriguing new Thunderbolt 3-equipped products as well. Promise’s Pegasus3 Series of Thunderbolt 3 products is headlined by an 8-bay storage solution, but it’s also revealed smaller 6-bay and 4-bay solutions for customers who don’t require as much storage space. All three products in the Pegasus3 Series support Thunderbolt 3, along with the 40GBps bandwidth that the interface affords. Promise hasn’t provided drive configurations or transfer rates in its press release, but we can assume that they will be quite speedy and feature RAID configurations like the competition. Each model in the Pegasus3 Series ships with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which allow for daisy chaining. Like CalDigit’s two Thunderbolt 3 offerings, a full-sized DisplayPort connection is there to support directly connecting a 4K monitor. Have a look at Promise’s full press release for more details. Potential game-changer Thunderbolt 3 is still in its infancy, and as you know, no Mac that’s currently on sale supports the technology. That should change in the near future, as some Windows machines and hardware providers already support Thunderbolt 3. We’ll be sure to keep you updated with any additional news regarding Thunderbolt 3, and the new offerings from Lacie, CalDigit and Promise.

I mean a 1TB Thunderbolt HDD in Belgium is 3x the price of a USB drive… And if you look at SSD Thunderbolt external drive prices… You’ll need to sell your house to be able to afford it. Avihai Nissan - 1 year ago Reply not a word on external GPUs? the egpu is about to become official when TB3 arrives to the masses, MSI had started a project that didn’t work out but there is already a community of people who connects their MBPs to chassis with a desktop GPU through TB2 :) Howie Isaacks - 1 year ago Reply Great. Outdated Apple displays, and those images on the displays are clearly faked since there’s no way that those displays are that bright after all these years. And FYI… CalDigit blows. Their drives require a special driver to be installed. That’s not good. Carson f. (@ScroogeMcDikens) - 1 year ago Reply False, no driver necessary. You can install the utility app that will eject all your volumes at once but, I’ve never installed anything. They worked great out of the box. viciosodiego - 1 year ago Reply Lacie is the champ. sicariis (@Sicariis) - 1 year ago Reply Which keyboard is that? Did they ‘shop out the cord of a standard Apple Keyboard? srgmac - 1 year ago Reply I was thinking the same thing haha, there is no Apple wireless keyboard with the number pad AFAIK cjt3007 - 1 year ago false, there is a bluetooth apple keyboard with number pad, it hasn’t been made since like 2009 though. Frank McKeown - 1 year ago Reply I can’t stand LaCie. Had several drives go down and they have horrible customer service. Not again. I’m sticking with OWC and will wait for their version when they come out. srgmac - 1 year ago Reply Are these backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 2? cjt3007 - 1 year ago Reply unlikely as it uses a different connector. srgmac - 1 year ago Reply Go with the Promise ones…They have the best HW Raid engines and support, hence why Apple choose them to their main storage OEM for Mac sales. cjt3007 - 1 year ago Reply Apple sales Lacie products as well… not sure what you mean here. Alexander James - 1 year ago Reply Thunderbolt speeds of 40GBps is a waste of time. The max read write speed of most drives is around 400MBps so you are limited by your hard drive. Don’t believe the crap people! Jeff Benjamin - 1 year ago Reply It’s not a waste of time at all. Remember, Thunderbolt can be daisy chained, and then there’s stuff like eGPUs. Mike Mihalik (@M2inOR) - 1 year ago Reply Alexander, educate me on the other interfaces supported by PCs or Macs (other than Thunderbolt) that could deliver 2400 MB/sec sustained. Newest HDD single drive can deliver >220 MB/sec (I have several 4TB and 6TB drives that can do this). RAIDed together, I would expect to see 12 x 200MB/sec, or approximately 2400MB/sec theoretically possible using hardware RAID controller. LaCie specs for the 12big state 2400MB/sec for a RAID5 configuration. We’ll have to wait for independent reviews to quantify what is actually possible. Thank you. Kevin Reilly - 4 months ago Reply What they don’t tell you is that the Thunderbolt 3 is NOT backwardly compatible with Thunderbolt 2 or 1! so don’t expect to use any of these on your existing computer. Blazing fast and unusable. I would caution to wait a year or two on these lemons. leicaman (@leicaman) - 1 day ago Reply What are you talking about? The current MacBook Pro with TouchBar supports Thunderbolt 3. The 13″ had two ports, the 15″ had four. All of them support Thunderbolt 3.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Gigabyte introduces fanless mini-desktop with Intel Core i3 Kaby Lake processor 04/20/2017 at 8:00 AM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Shortly after unveiling two tiny, fanless computers with low-power Intel Apollo Lake processors, Gigabyte is expanding the lineup with a slightly larger model featuring a significantly more powerful Core i3-7100U Kaby Lake chip. It’s called the Gigabyte BRIX GB-EKi3A-7100  and it’s basically a computer with the guts of a decent laptop, but crammed into a small box with a big heat sink for passive cooling and silent operation. You could use the computer for commercial, industrial, or home applications. For the right price, I’d totally be tempted to pick up something like this for use in my office, since a silent PC would be great for recording podcasts and videos. Unfortunately, the pricing hasn’t been announced yet. The new BRIX mini PC measures about 7.1″ x 4.6″ x 1.4″ and supports up to 32GB of DDR4-2133 memory (with 2 SODIMM slots) and features an M.2 2280 slot for solid state storage. Other features include: HDMI 2.;0 Mini DisplayPort 1.2 1 USB 3.1 Type-C port 1 USB 3.1 port 2 USB 3.0 ports 802.11ac WiFi Bluetooth 4.2 Gigabit Ethernet Headset jack RS232 COM port With a 15 watt, dual-core processor, the GB-EKi3A-7100 isn’t exactly a speed demon. But it should be better suited for general purpose computing than the Apollo Lake models with their cheaper, less powerful 6 watt quad-core chips. via Fanless Tech Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

"To that end, we are pleased to offer demos at the NAB Show that will highlight how well our equipment works in even the most intense production environments." Members of the press and other interested parties are invited to visit AIC to see the company's server and storage demonstrations at booth 13013 in the south lower hall at the NAB Show in Las Vegasbetween April 24 and April 27, 2017.

Linux 4.12 Should Be Another Exciting, Featureful Cycle Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 21 April 2017 at 07:26 AM EDT. 4 Comments If all goes according to plan, the Linux 4.11 kernel will be officially released this weekend and therefore the Linux 4.12 merge window will immediately open for two weeks. There is a lot on our radar for Linux 4.12. Among the likely material we've been tracking for Linux 4.12 features are listed below. - Our favorite subsystem, the Direct Rendering Manager. As usual, there's a lot of DRM driver changes. - Most notable to the DRM tree for Linux 4.12 is initial Radeon RX Vega support. But before getting too excited, this support for the next-generation AMD Vega GPU lacks any physical display capabilities as the DC (formerly DAL) code isn't landing for Linux 4.12. So when Vega launches next month, Linux gamers and others will still need to use the AMDGPU-PRO hybrid driver or build your own out-of-tree kernel build to get Vega working with display capabilities. Hopefully DC will finally land for Linux 4.13 to allow Vega display, HDMI/DP audio, open the door for FreeSync, etc. - Exciting for Intel's DRM driver is enable atomic mode-setting by default. - The Nouveau DRM driver code is also exciting this round as it contains initial accelerated GeForce GTX 1050/1060/1070/1080 support as well as for the Tegra X2 in the Jetson TX2 developer board. This Pascal acceleration for the consumer cards comes thanks to Nouveau DRM driver work by NVIDIA and they have now released the signed firmware images needed for this hardware support. But don't expect too much out of it with Linux 4.12 as there isn't any Pascal (or Maxwell) re-clocking so the performance will be slow. - As mentioned yesterday, the BFQ I/O scheduler is finally being mainlined as excitement for a lot of Linux enthusiasts. - Intel 5-Level Paging support to expand the virtual/physical address space for Linux systems. - For those running Linux on modern Intel hardware, more P-State clean-ups and optimizations are coming for 4.12. - A Mux Controller Subsystem has been proposed. - There's also the 4.12 proposal for the TEE subsystem, the Trusted Execution Environment. - Likely EXT4 statx support for this new system call added to 4.11. - We are still waiting to see whether Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) will make it for Linux 4.12. Stay tuned for more Linux 4.12 feature coverage and benchmarks in the weeks to come. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The company is targeting the new ZBook devices at professionals and creators who need power and security on the go. First up is the HP ZBook Studio, built for “creative visionaries” like filmmakers and engineers. The device touts a whopping 16.5 hour of battery life, a “stunning design”, and a 4K UHD display that’s color corrected. The device comes in at just 18mm thick, though it does have a starting weight of 4.6lbs (2kg). The ZBook Studio also features powerful internal specs, like a server-grade Intel Xeon processor, or a 7th generation Core processor, Nvidia Quadro graphics, and up to 2TB of storage, together with dual HP Z Turbo Drives and dual Thunderbolt 3 ports. The HP ZBook 17 and Zbook 15 Up next is the HP ZBook 17, the top of the line model, which also gives yous a choice between an Intel Xeon or 7th-gen Core processor, has either Nvidia Quadro or AMD RadeonPro graphics, and comes with up to 4TB of storage. HP touts this device as perfect for VR content, being able to render “ultra-smooth” 90 FPS VR. The HP ZBook 15 is the next device in descending order of power and price. HP lauded this device as being the one used by NASA on the International Space Station, thanks to it being capable of handling demanding workloads for long stretches of time. The device retains the Xeon or Core processor options from its more expensive sibling, as well as the options between Quadro and RadeonPro graphics. That said, storage options are not quite as generous, maxing out at 3TB. The HP Zbook 14u and Zbook 15u Lastly, the HP ZBook 14u is the smallest and most affordable device in this series. The device is classed as an Ultrabook, thanks to its light and thin frame, at 3.6lbs and 22mm thickness, respectively. The notebook features a 14-inch FHD display, with a touch-enabled option also available. The Zbook 14u is powered by 7th-generation Core processors, AMD’s FirePro 3D graphics, and has up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. There’s also a 15-inch version available, dubbed the ZBook 15u. All the new devices are available right now, except for the ZBook 14u, which will come later this year. In terms of pricing, the ZBook 17 is the top of the line starting at $1,519, followed by the ZBook 15 starting at $1,419. Next up is the ZBook Studio with a starting price of $1,399, with the ZBook 15u retailing for $1,079. The ZBook 14u will likely retail under $1,000, but pricing hasn’t been announced yet.

Recently, users discovered that they were not able to receive the latest security updates on their Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 PCs that are powered by newer Intel chips. Microsoft issued a new tool that checks a computer’s processor and prevents it from receiving any updates in case it detects it’s a new generation CPU on a computer running a Windows version that’s not Windows 10. As expected, someone was able to crack Microsoft’s restrictions and re-enable updates. Don't Miss: Niantic is finally addressing Pokemon Go’s biggest problem Both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are still supported. We’re looking at three and six years of updates, respectively. But Microsoft would rather have you upgrading that new PC to the latest version of Windows 10. One way to convince you to pull the trigger is trying to prevent your laptop from receiving system updates meant to keep your PC safe. To be fair, Microsoft did warn Windows users about what’s coming. New Intel chips won’t support older Windows versions, Microsoft said all the way back in 2016. However, when Patch Tuesday came last week, and Windows 10 Creators Update along with it, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users discovered they were not able to receive their security updates. Microsoft’s tool was already in place giving an error message that read “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” One Windows user took it upon himself to fix this issue, ZDNet reports. Developer Zeffy posted a new patch on GitHub that stops Microsoft’s tool from checking your computer’s processor age. That means any Kaby Lake or Bristol Ridge Ryzen users can install the security updates for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 after using this unofficial patch. According to the developer, Microsoft’s March 16 update for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 came with this changelog entry: “Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update.” As Zeffy put it, that’s “essentially a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10”. You can get Zeffy’s fix at this link.

Take HP's latest Zbook laptop workstations , which were announced on Friday. These heavy built laptops -- which is why they are called mobile workstations -- have comparable memory and storage capacity technology to the Mac Pro, but excel in other areas. The laptops feature Thunderbolt 3 ports, DDR4 memory, Intel's latest Kaby Lake-based Core and Xeon processors, and the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD. By comparison the Mac Pro has Thunderbolt 2 ports, an old AMD GPU, DDR3 memory and Intel Xeon processors based on the Ivy Bridge architecture, which were released in 2013. Add that all up, and you can rely on the Zbook for work like content creation, VR and video editing that you would otherwise do on a Mac Pro. Windows desktop workstations, like HP's Z and Dell's Precision desktops, are already far superior in technology than the Mac Pro. And the Zbook laptops -- which come in screen sizes of 14-, 15.6- and 17.3-inch screens, are up to half the price of a Mac Pro. Apple has said it will upgrade the Mac Pro in 2018 or 2019, but the current version, which was released in 2013 and recently got a minor upgrade, is so behind that many have moved over to Linux or Windows PCs. The ZBook 17 is the most powerful of HP's new workstations. It supports up to 4TB of hard drive or SSD storage, 64GB of memory, and can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3 v6 or Core i5/i7 chips. It has two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which can support two 4K displays. It can support GPUs including Nvidia's latest Quadro P5000, which can handle VR content creation. The laptop can be configured with a 4K screen, and it also HDMI and USB 3.0 ports. It will be priced starting at US$1,519. The Zbook 15 has many features that are similar to the Zbook 17, but is a step down in some features. It supports up to 3TB of storage, and supports Nvidia's Quadro M2200 GPU, not the P5000. This laptop can be configured with a 4K screen, and is priced starting at $1,419. The Zbook Studio, which starts at $1,399, is like the Zbook 15, but much thinner and lighter at around 2 kilograms. It also has fewer features like half the memory and lesser storage capacity. Given its size, it supports only Nvidia's Quadro M1200M GPU. It also has a DisplayPort 1.2 port. These laptops are available worldwide. Other features include support for AMD's FirePro GPUs, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. HP also announced the ZBook 14u with a 14-inch screen, which is only available with Intel Core i5/i7 processors. The laptop's price wasn't announced at the time of press. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Traders were also encouraged by a downward revision in second-quarter economic growth on Friday that wasn't as bad as economists had expected. The Dow Jones industrial average and other indexes all gained more than 1 percent. Bernanke said in a speech at the Fed's annual conference that while the economic recovery remains tentative, the central bank remains ready to take extra steps to stimulate the economy if necessary, such as buying more debt securities in order to keep interest rates low. He said he still expects the economy to grow next year. "It could have been worse, and because it wasn't, that was good news," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Investments, based in Richmond, Virginia. "Clearly the bar is being lowered for what constitutes good news these days." The upturn was a respite from a mainly dismal month on the stock market, which has been falling steadily since its recent high reached on August 9 on a series of poor indicators on the economy. A deep slump in home sales last month was the latest sign that the economy was weakening. The market stumbled briefly in midmorning after Intel Corp. lowered its revenue estimate. There, too, the news wasn't as bad as it could have been. Intel's shares edged higher after resuming trading since the company's new forecast wasn't as bad as the worst estimates circulating among analysts. In economic news, the Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product grew at a 1.6 percent rate in the April-to-June period. That's still way down from its earlier estimate of 2.4 percent but not as bad as the 1.4 percent expected by economists. "These are terrible numbers," Kim Caughey, equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, said. "But they weren't frighteningly horrible." Yields on Treasurys, which help set interest rates on loans like mortgages, rose sharply as their prices fell. That could put upward pressure on mortgage rates, which are still at historic lows. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 164.84, or 1.7 percent, to close at 10,150.65. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 17.37, or 1.7 percent, to 1,064.59 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 34.94, or 1.6 percent, to 2,153.63. The Dow's gains Friday wiped out much of its losses for the week, but all major indexes still ended the week with losses. The Dow was down 0.6 percent for the week, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 percent, and the Nasdaq lost 1.2 percent. Rising stocks outnumbered falling ones six to one on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 4.2 billion shares. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.65 percent, well above the 2.48 percent it was trading at late Thursday. A heated-up bidding war between Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. also helped to lift shares. The big computer makers are battling to control the data-storage company 3Par Inc. HP fired the latest salvo early Friday, raising its bid for 3Par to $1.88 billion, topping Dell's latest offer by 11 percent. 3Par shares gained $6.43 to $32.46, above HP's latest offer of $30 per share and a sign that investors are hopeful for another counteroffer from Dell. Dell's initial bid for 3Par last week was $18 per share. Intel was up 19 cents at $18.37. European shares also moved higher after the better-than-expected figures on U.S. economic growth came out. European shares also got a lift after the Britain raised its estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent. In London, the FTSE-100 index rose 0.9 percent, while the DAX 0.7 percent and the CAC-40 in Paris rose 0.9 percent. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up 1 percent. - Sapa-AP Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 #FreedomMovement unites Zuma foes 2 Zim city honours prostitutes who made the town popular 3 SA boxing trainer Nick Durandt dies in accident 4 Gauteng man wins PowerBall TWICE! 5 ANC slams Ayanda Mabulu's 'grotesque' painting Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

It has intel HD 4000 + radeon 6770m 1 gb VRAM, 8 GB system Ram, with i7 CPU. I understand from internet sources that the max resolution that 6770m can support is 2560 x 1600. i got a 4K display, when i connect and enable only the 4K display, the max resolution option available is 2048 x 1280. the 6770m is the active graphics. I tried to do the registry edit trick but still 2560 x 1600 option does not become abvailable. I tried to add a custom resolution thru the intel graphics app but it gives an error that this resolution excceds the max bandwidth. I have a feeling that the radeon itself can support 2560 x 1600, but may be because Intel HD 4000 cant, its now showing me the higher resolution. I tried to disable intel HD 4000 from device manager but then the grahics stopped all together. Is there any way to enable 2560 x 1600 on this laptop?     nexus696 View Public Profile Find all posts by nexus696     (#2) Agonist Maha Guru     Videocard: R9 Fury Nitro OC Processor: i7 3930k@ 4.1 H100i Mainboard: ASUS P9X79 PRO Memory: HyperX 1866 16GB DDR3 Soundcard: Asus Xonar DXG X-540 5.1 PSU: OCZ Fata1ty 1000w Yesterday, 04:49 | posts: 2,198 | Location: Tennessee This is just a guess, but download this https://www.monitortests.com/cru-1.3.zip, and make a custom resolution for the TV with 3840x2160@30hz.

Pai was responding to questions in a post-FCC meeting press conference Thursday (April 20). He said the conversation was not about any pending proceeding, but outside of that context he was soliciting input on how to "Secure online consumer protections." He said that he has been consistent in saying that he favors a free and open Internet and opposes Title II. According to sources he has talked with telecom trade groups about what to do next on network neutrality, including possibly have the Federal Trade Commission enforce voluntary commitments not to block or degrade, but he signaled at the press conference that that was part of the same input-collection process generally and not about any pending proceeding. A reporter had noted that there had been no ex parte filing on that meeting, which would be required if it had dealt with a proceeding currently before the commission. Pai said he did not outline a regulatory plan for rolling back Title II in that trade group meeting. "We did not discuss the merits of any pending proceeding," he said, but, again, generally how to "secure some of those principles of a free and open Internet that I think most people agree on." Pai said he was "reaching out and trying to solicit a diversity of views among a diversity of stakeholders" and that he thought for their part they recognized, as he did, that "there is a lot of common ground here with respect to the need for a free and open Internet."

Spiderwebs, Everywhere Soon, Your Fingerprint Will Be On Your Mastercard Unofficial Patch Removes Windows 7, 8.1 Update Block On Newer Processors Logan Booker Apr 22, 2017, 12:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  amd Australian Stories computing intel ryzen windows windows 7 windows 8 windows 8.1 Share Image: AMD Microsoft has gone ahead with its plan to disable updates on pre-Windows 10 operating systems running on newer AMD and Intel processors. While your machine won't suddenly stop working, it does mean your Windows 7 or 8.1 install won't benefit from the latest updates. Fortunately, a simple workaround is now available. As predicted, an enterprising coder by the handle "zeffy" dived into Windows' internals and discovered where and how Microsoft performs the check. He or she explored a number of avenues and came up with two options to "fix" the problem. Both involved edits to a file called "wuaueng.dll", with one appearing to be an "internal testing feature used by Microsoft" and "could be removed in future updates", ruling it out in zeffy's mind. The second choice requires a "simple 1-byte change" and is the path the coder went with. The result is a patch anyone can apply to their Windows 7 or 8.1 installation. Of course, the patch comes with some caveats: You have to apply a new patch whenever wuaueng.dll gets updated. SFC scan errors will most likely occur as it will believe the integrity of the system has been compromised. If you can live with these, the patch is available from zeffy's GitHub repository. [GitHub, via DSO Gaming] WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments skrybe @skrybe Apr 22, 2017, 12:32pm I still think MS disabling updates is a terrible idea considering the OSes are still in extended or even mainstream support. Fair enough to dump Vista and XP, but 7 and especially 8(.1) are new enough they *should* be getting updates. Why announce support windows if you're not going to honour them? Reply 0 soldant @soldant Apr 22, 2017, 1:45pm Windows 7 was released in 2009, so I think it's fine to move on from that OS, it's been long enough for people who will be using newer hardware to upgrade. Remember back in the 90s we were upgrading our OS every few years, it wasn't until Windows XP and its unexpected lifespan that people stopped. Now MS are back on track with their regular upgrades. I'd rather we have people using modern operating systems and focus on improving them rather than extended legacy support. Reply 0 grim @grim Apr 22, 2017, 3:39pm something something...

Up until now the Flex series has only included Windows-powered machines with Intel processors, but Lenovo has just introduced its first Flex Chromebook. The Lenovo Flex 11 Chromebook is a $279 convertible with a 2.1 GHz quad-core ARM-based processor and Google’s Chrome operating system. The new notebook features 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 1366 x 768 pixel IPS display. The Flex 11 Chromebook measures 11.7″ x 8.1″ x 0.8″ and weighs about 3 pounds. It supports 802.11ac WiFi and features a water-resistant keyboard and sealed touchpad: you can spill up to a cup of water on the laptop and water should drain off without damaging the computer. Lenovo says the Flex 11 Chromebook should get up to 10 hours of battery life, will support Android apps and the Google Play Store (after an upcoming software update), and features HDMI, USB 3.0, and SD card slots. It also has a USB Type-C port which is used for charging as well as data. Prefer Windows?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Apple Apple’s most powerful computer in years will be in stores by Christmas Chris Smith @chris_writes April 18th, 2017 at 7:22 PM Share Tweet In a rare move a few weeks ago, Apple confirmed  that it’s working on new Mac desktops, including a revamped Mac Pro and iMacs that will also target “pro” users. A new report from Asia says that Apple is looking to launch its 2017 iMacs in the second half of the year, with the high-end Mac set to hit stores in time for Christmas. Don't Miss: Apple is having trouble getting the iPhone 8’s signature feature to actually work Apple will begin production of its new iMac PCs in May, Digitimes learned from Taiwan-based supply chain makers familiar with the plans. Quanta Computers is expected to manufacture both iMac versions this year, including the regular and the high-end model. The latter will probably be the most exciting version of the 2017 iMac line, a “server-grade” iMac targeting high-end buyers. Apple is expected to launch 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs in the third quarter of the year, the report notes, to catch up with the holiday shopping season. The iMac Pro will feature Intel’s Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, 16GB to 64GB of ECC RAM, and up to 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. On top of that, the desktop will pack the latest discrete graphics card, although it’s unclear what that means. Intel’s chip is not released yet, MacRumors explains. As for that “ECC RAM,” that’s error correcting memory, the kind that can detect and correct data corruption. A recent report from Pike’s Universum said a few days ago that the 2017 iMac is set for a late October launch and mentioned the same set of specs for the high-end model. The report also said the iMac might feature AMD graphics to support VR and pro apps, as well as Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C connectivity. Finally, a new keyboard is also in the works, according to the source. Recent patent discoveries indicated Apple is working on Touch Bar enabled standalone keyboards for the iMac. Apple is also reportedly working on a new 8K display for the next-gen Mac Pro, and a next-gen Mac mini.

(Photo credit: MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)    The H-1B Visa Racket Should Be Abolished, Not Reformed Ilana Mercer Author, The Trump Revolution 6:51 PM 04/21/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5608880 Billionaire businessman Marc Cuban insists that the H-1B visa racket is a feature of the vaunted American free market. This is nonsense on stilts. It can’t go unchallenged. Another billionaire, our president, has ordered that the H-1B program be reformed. This, too, is disappointing. You’ll see why. First, let’s correct Mr. Cuban: America has not a free economy, but a mixed-economy. State and markets are intertwined. Trade, including trade in labor, is not free; it’s regulated to the hilt. If anything, the labyrinth of work visas is an example of a fascistic government-business cartel in operation. The H-1B permit, in particular, is part of that state-sponsored visa system. The primary H-1B hogs—Infosys (and another eight, sister Indian firms), Microsoft, and Intel—import labor with what are grants of government privilege. Duly, the corporations that hog H-1Bs act like incorrigibly corrupt rent seekers. Not only do they get to replace the American worker, but they get to do so at his expense. Here’s how: Globally, a series of sordid liaisons ensures that American workers are left high and dry. Through the programs of the International Trade Administration, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the International Monetary Fund, and other oink-operations, the taxpaying American worker is forced to subsidize and underwrite the investment risks of the very corporations that have given him the boot. Domestically, the fascistic partnership with the State amounts to a subsidy to business at the expense of the taxpayer. See, corporations in our democratic welfare state externalize their employment costs onto the taxpayers. So while public property is property funded by taxpayers through expropriated taxes; belongs to taxpayers; is to be managed for their benefit—at least one million additional immigrants a year, including recipients of the H-1B visa, are allowed the free use of taxpayer-supported infrastructure and amenities. Every new arrival avails himself of public works such as roads, hospitals, parks, libraries, schools, and welfare. Does this epitomize the classical liberal idea of laissez faire? Moreover, chain migration or family unification means every H-1B visa recruit is a ticket for an entire tribe. The initial entrant—the meal ticket—will pay his way. The honor system not being an especially strong value in the Third World, the rest of the clan will be America’s problem. More often than not, chain-migration entrants become wards of the American taxpayer. Spreading like gravy over a tablecloth, this rapid, inorganic population growth is detrimental to all ecosystems: natural, social and political. Take Seattle and its surrounding counties. Between April 2015 and 2016, the area was inundated with “86,320 new residents, marking it the region’s biggest population gains this century. Fueled in large part by the technology industry, an average of 236 people is moving to the Seattle area each day,” reported Geekwire.com. (Reporters for our local fish-wrapper—in my case, parrot-cage liner—have discharged their journalistic duties by inviting readers to “share” their traffic-jam stories.) Never as dumb as the local reporters, the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Cuban are certainly as detached. Barricaded in their obscenely lavish compounds—from the comfort of their monster mansions—these social engineers don’t experience the “environmental impacts of rapid urban expansion”; the destruction of verdant open spaces and farmland; the decrease in the quality of the water we drink and air we breathe, the increase in traffic and traffic accidents, air pollution, the cellblock-like housing erected to accommodate their imported I.T. workers and extended families, the delicate bouquet of amped up waste management and associated seepages. For locals, this lamentable state means an inability to afford homes in a market in which property prices have been artificially inflated. Young couples lineup to view tiny apartments. They dream of that picket fence no more. (And our “stupid leaders,” to quote the president before he joined leadership, wonder why birthrates are so low!) In a true free market, absent the protectionist state, corporate employers would be accountable to the community, and would be wary of the strife and lowered productivity brought about by a multiethnic and multi-linguistic workforce. All the more so when a foreign workforce moves into residential areas almost overnight as has happened in Seattle and its surrounds. Alas, since the high-tech traitors can externalize their employment costs on to the community; because corporations are subsidized at every turn by their victims—they need not bring in the best. Cuban thinks they do. High tech needs to be able to “search the world for the best applicants,” he burbled to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Yet more crap. Why doesn’t the president know that the H-1B visa category is not a special visa for highly skilled individuals, but goes mostly to average workers? “Indian business-process outsourcing companies, which predominantly provide technology support to corporate back offices,” by the Economist’s accounting. Overall, the work done by the H1-B intake does not require independent judgment, critical reasoning or higher-order thinking. “Average workers; ordinary talent doing ordinary work,” attest the experts who’ve been studying this intake for years. The master’s degree is the exception within the H1-B visa category. More significant: there is a visa category that is reserved exclusively for individuals with extraordinary abilities and achievement. I know, because the principal sponsor in our family received this visa. I first wrote about the visa that doesn’t displace ordinary Americans in … 2008: It’s the O-1 visa. “Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics,” states the Department of Homeland Security, “means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.” Most significant: There is no cap on the number of O-1 visa entrants allowed. Access to this limited pool of talent is unlimited. My point vis-à-vis the O-1 visa is this: The H-1B hogs are forever claiming that they are desperate for talent. In reality, they have unlimited access to individuals with unique abilities through the open-ended O-1 visa program. There is no limit to the number of geniuses American companies can import. Theoretically, the H-1B program could be completely abolished and all needed Einsteins imported through the O-1 program.  (Why, even future first ladies would stand a chance under the business category of the O-1A visa, as a wealth-generating supermodel could certainly qualify.) Now you understand my disappointment. In his April 18 Executive Order, President Trump promised to merely reform a program that needs abolishing. That is if “Hire American” means anything to anybody anymore. ** ILANA Mercer is the author of The Trump Revolution: The Donald’s Creative Destruction Deconstructed (June, 2016) & Into the Cannibal’s Pot: Lessons for America From Post-Apartheid South Africa (2011).

After stalling over the committee chairman's ties to Donald Trump's White House and disagreements over who should testify, the bipartisan committee has sent two letters inviting a number of FBI, NSA and Obama administration officials, including Yates, to appear behind closed doors on May 2. The planned hearings are the first the committee has announced since its chairman, Republican Representative Devin Nunes, recused himself from the Russia investigation on April 6 after receiving information at the White House about surveillance that swept up some information about members of Trump's transition team. Jeremy Bash implies Sally Yates had revelations for House Intel & Nunes cancelled her public hearing Echoing Trump, Nunes suggested that Obama's administration had handled that information incorrectly. Nunes remains the committee's chairman. FBI director James Comey and NSA director Michael Rogers testified in a public hearing on March 20. At that hearing, Comey confirmed for the first time that the FBI was investigating possible ties between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia as Moscow sought to influence the election. Read more The acting attorney general Trump fired for ‘betraying’ Justice Dept Nunes was a supporter of Trump's campaign and a member of his transition team. His decision two days after the public hearing to hold a press conference about the information and discuss it with Trump before disclosing it to Democrats raised questions about whether he could lead a credible investigation. Committee Democrats also were angered when Nunes scrapped a scheduled public hearing with Yates. A planned closed hearing with Comey and Rogers also was put off.

Russia denies the allegations, which Trump also dismisses. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting a separate, similar investigation. Senate investigators currently are interviewing analysts and intelligence agents who prepared public and classified reports in January that concluded that Russia had interfered in last year's election on Trump's behalf, an official familiar with the congressional activity said. At this point they are a long way from scheduling interviews or hearings with any principal witnesses from either the Obama or Trump administrations, the official said.

With only 115 transistors, their processor isn't going to top any benchmark rankings, but it's "a first step towards the development of microprocessors based on 2D semiconductors," the researchers at Vienna University of Technology said in a paper published in the journal Nature this month. [ Further reading: The 8080 chip at 40: What's next for the mighty microprocessor? ] Two-dimensional materials have the benefit of flexibility, meaning that they can be incorporated more easily into wearable devices or connected sensors, which potentially makes them less breakable: Picture a smartphone that bends rather than breaks if you drop it. Today's semiconductors and screens are already pretty thin, but they still rely on the three-dimensional physical properties of the materials they're made from in order to function. Bend a silicon wafer and it will crack. But 2D materials like graphene, or the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) used by the Vienna researchers, are truly two-dimensional, made with crystals just one layer of atoms or molecules thick, allowing them to flex. TMDs are compounds composed of a transition metal such as molybdenum or tungsten and a chalcogen (typically sulfur, selenium or tellurium, although oxygen is also a chalcogen). Like graphene, they form into layers. But unlike graphene, which conducts electricity like a metal, they are semiconductors, which is great news for flexible chip designers. Stefan Wachter, Dmitry Polyushkin and Thomas Mueller of the Institute of Photonics, working with Ole Bethge of the Institute of Solid State Electronics in Vienna, decided to use molybdenum disulfide to build their microprocessor. They deposited two molecule-thick layers of it on a silicon substrate, etched with their circuit design and separated by a layer of aluminium oxide. "The substrate fulfills no other function than acting as a carrier medium and could thus be replaced by glass or any other material, including flexible substrates," they wrote. Recent Intel microprocessors act on data in 64-bit "words," can understand hundreds or even thousands of different instructions, depending on how you count them, and contain hundreds of millions of transistors. In contrast, the microprocessor built by the researchers can act on data only one bit at a time, using a set of just four instructions (NOP, LDA, AND and OR). And the circuit features used to build it are of the order of 2 micrometers across, 100 times larger than those found in the latest Intel and ARM processors. With more work, though, the microprocessor's complexity could be increased and its size reduced, the researchers said. They deliberately chose an overly large feature size for their manufacturing process to reduce the effects of holes, cracks and contamination in the molybdenum disulfide film and to make it easier to inspect the results with an optical microscope. "We do not see any roadblocks that could prevent the scaling of our 1-bit design to multi-bit data," they said, and only the challenge of lowering contact resistance stands in the way of sub-micrometer manufacturing. That's not to say it will be easy: Although the manufacturing yield for subunits was high, with around 80 percent of the arithmetic-logic units fully functional, their non-fault tolerant design meant only a few percent of finished devices worked properly. Commercial microprocessor manufacturers deal with yield problems by making their chip designs modular, and testing them at a variety of speeds. Chips that work at higher speed fetch higher prices, while faulty subcomponents can be permanently disabled and the resulting chips, otherwise fully functional, sold as lower-spec models. It's taken 46 years for Intel to get from the 4004, a four-bit central processor with 46 instructions, to the latest incarnation of the x86 architecture, Kaby Lake: With all that the industry has learned about micromanufacturing since then, progress with flexible semiconductors may be a little faster.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Homebrew patch reinstates Windows Update on… Homebrew patch reinstates Windows Update on systems hit by CPU block By Brad Jones — April 19, 2017 8:46 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you This unofficial patch means that affected users no longer have to choose between their preferred version of Windows, their chosen CPU, and their usage of Windows Update. Last month, it emerged that Microsoft was implementing a plan to restrict systems built with newer CPUs and running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 from utilizing Windows Update. Now, a GitHub user known as Zeffy has published a fix that allows users to continue receiving updates. Microsoft announced its intentions well in advance, but many users working with the likes of Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and AMD’s Ryzen line were still frustrated to find that they would have to choose between their preferred operating system and Windows Update. Fortunately, Zeffy’s solution seems to be a comprehensive workaround. The fix works by patching Windows .DLL files, according to a report from Bleeping Computer. This bypasses the CPU version check that finds out what operating system is in use, which in turn allows Windows Update to interact with systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Zeffy has made batch scripts available via GitHub, so that more suspicious users can poke around his code until they’re confident enough to run the workaround on their system. The scripts were apparently created by reverse-engineering the KB4012218 update that initially blocked Windows Update from working on older versions of Windows. The fact that Zeffy was able to come up with a fix relatively quickly seems to confirm that Microsoft introduced these measures as a means of encouraging users to make the upgrade to Windows 10, rather than because of any technological limitations. That’s not particularly surprising, but it sets a troubling precedent for the future. Microsoft has made no secret of its ambition to see a billion devices running Windows 10, even if it’s not likely to hit that estimate in 2018. However, between annoying reminders and these restrictions on what hardware is compatible with older versions, it certainly seems that the company is prioritizing big usage figures over the quality of the user experience.

Dubbed Groq, the clandestine company has shared little of its plans or roadmap, though recent filings suggest more than $10m in funding has already been secured. More than four-fifths of the original Google TPU team are now working there. The TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit, is Google’s homegrown AI chip. The company began working on it several years ago, in the hope of making neural networking much more practical at scale. While machine learning isn’t new – Intel is working on enabling it with CPUs, while NVIDIA is coming at it from the opposite direction, with GPUs, among others – it’s computationally very intensive. That’s a problem when you’re running an operation on the scale that Google is. Neural networking and artificial intelligence are seen as essential to improving everything from search result accuracy, to computational image processing, through to spam and malware detection. AI also has a home in the Google Assistant, which is at heart of standalone devices like Google Home, but also features on Android smartphones and more. The result was the TPU, powering TensorFlow, a scalable system that opens neural networking up to everyone. It was developed in part by Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who is now working with investor Chamath Palihapitiya on the startup known today to be Groq. Also on the roster are a claimed eight of the first ten people from the TPU project. “It’s too early to talk specifics,” Palihapitiya told CBNC, “but we think what they’re building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing.” Two SEC filings from last year confirmed both the name of the company and its initial funding. According to those documents – which name Palihapitiya, Ross, and former Google X engineer Douglas Wightman – Groq raised $10.3m. While taking on Google – not to mention Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA, among others – in developing a chip is a sizable challenge, the potential upshot if Groq’s technology proves successful is huge. Earlier this year, on a report into the TPU’s performance in real-world trials, Google claimed it had proved 10x more efficient at processing than using GPUs. That has implications for power consumption, chip cost, and more. NOW READ: Google has huge plans for its Tensor neural networking tech How far we are from seeing the fruits of Groq’s labors is unclear, and it seems likely that, if the company’s schemes are successful, they’ll be a tempting target for acquisition by some of the bigger names in chip development. AI is big business at the moment: only this week, Amazon opened up the artificial intelligence that powers its Alexa assistant to third-party developers and device manufacturers. ARM is positioning its low-power cores as ideal for AI, and Bosch and NVIDIA are doing something similar for the brains of self-driving vehicles.

What’s even more impressive is the adoption rate. The speed of new tech taking over aspects of everyday life is blindingly fast. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of few providers of brains to all this tech. Fundamentally, a company as seasoned as INTC should have a rosy long-term future. It has a few competitors, but there is enough room for everyone to thrive. And the cost of entry is high enough so that there won’t be too many new entrants into the arena. Click to Enlarge Technically, INTC stock could be developing a massive bullish pattern that could bring new multi-decade highs … but it could take some time. The earnings release in a couple of weeks could spur a move, but those events for the short term are coin flips. The short-term reaction to earnings is more gambling than investing regardless of the quality of the report. From a price-earnings perspective INTC is not expensive. Furthermore the analyst expectations are also evenly distributed. So INTC stock is not set up for a big disappointment. Nevertheless, I am not a fan of buying Intel stock here and risking $36 per share hoping for a rally. Instead, I prefer selling risk below proven support and let time do the work and I can profit even if the stock stalls. The Bet: Sell the INTC Dec $31 naked put and collect 90 cents to open. In essence, I get paid for a chance to own Intel stock at a 15% discount from current levels. If it falls below $31, I would be put the stock and accrue losses below $30.10 per share. Selling naked puts is dangerous and I only do it if I am willing and able to own the stock at that price so it can be daunting. To render the risk more time, I can change the bet to a sold credit put spread instead. This way my maximum risk will be finite and still earn a respectable yield. The Alternate: Sell INTC $31/$30 credit put spread. Both trades have about the same theoretical 85% chance of success but this one is hedged where as the sold naked put is not. If successful the spread will yield 20% reward on risk. Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 in a personal 1on1 webinar here. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Leaked Microsoft document confirms Windows 10 Cloud and a Chromebook competitor Called "Cloudbooks" by industry watchers, the specs mirror what a Chromebook offers. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 22 April, 2017 04:25 0 - - - - print email A Microsoft document detailing the minimum hardware specs for Microsoft Windows 10 Cloud-powered laptops seems to be the best evidence yet that Microsoft plans to launch a Chromebook competitor on May 2. Windows Central obtained a “recommended minimum spec” document, presumably handed out to Microsoft’s partners. The document outlines what Microsoft hopes to achieve with what the document calls an “Edu Cloud device” (and industry watchers have dubbed "Cloudbooks"): all-day battery life, a quick boot and resume cycle, and at least a quad-core Intel Celeron processor powering it all. It’s also titled “Windows 10 Cloud Performance Targets,” confirming the name of the new OS. A Microsoft representative declined to comment. Microsoft’s invitation to an education-focused launch event in New York on May 2 hinted strongly that a Chromebook competitor was in the cards Though Windows PCs dominate the workplace, Google’s Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks have quickly insinuated themselves into American classrooms. Google and its partners have pitched Chromebooks as affordable, simple to use and manage, and rugged enough to survive student use. Windows 10 Cloud appears to be Microsoft's attempt to go back to school. The impact on you: One key advantage of a Chromebook, from Google’s perspective, is that it contributes to a virtuous cycle: Kids use the popular Android tablets and phones at home, then access something similar in the classroom. To help break that chain, Microsoft needs to get kids used to Windows. While this may have little impact on you personally, you might say that this is a fight for the hearts and minds of your children. What Cloudbooks will contain Windows 10 Cloud reportedly will restrict apps to the Windows Store, forbidding the use of non-Store apps like Google Chrome. Microsoft’s document also notes that its performance benchmarks assume the use of Intune device management policies specifically designed for the classroom. The spec document plainly states that Microsoft considers Chromebooks its chief competition. In a comparison of “performance benchmarks,” Microsoft’s target is 10-plus hours of “all day” battery life, with cold-boot times of 20 seconds and resume times of under 2 seconds. The document does not list suggested pricing. Likewise, Microsoft lays out what hardware the new devices should include: a quad-core chip, like a Celeron, or higher; 4GB of RAM, and at least 32GB of eMMC or SSD storage. Interestingly, pen and touchscreen capabilities are listed as “optional,” which would discard one of the chief advantages that a typical Windows PC has over a Chromebook. Who will make these devices remains a mystery at the moment. PC companies like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo have all already built Chromebooks, meaning they’ll have to choose between platforms, or support both. It’s telling, though, that Microsoft itself admits at least internally that it Windows 10 Cloud-based laptops won’t quite measure up to the competition. In its comparison of the two platforms, the document notes that Chromebooks are faster to cold-boot to a login screen (20 seconds to 15 seconds) as well as from the sign-in screen to the desktop (15 seconds versus 10 seconds). We’ll have to see how Microsoft spins this: Selling something that's almost-as-good as the competition doesn’t sound like much of a pitch. 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. The Dell Latitude 5480 we reviewed packs a quad-core processor and discrete GPU, making it a unique and powerful 14-inch laptop for business. Business laptops tend to eschew the fancy, delicate builds of their more premium brethren. The new Dell Latitude 5480 fits that mold because it's rough and tough, but it's also a completely capable and secure modern 14-inch laptop. I spent a few weeks with the Latitude 5480, and the specifications and features of it make a sound computing machine for 2017. While it's not particularly beautiful, and the trackpad leaves room for improvement, the Latitude 5480 is all about serious attitude. About this review Dell supplied a loaner Latitude 5480 for review purposes. The unit tested features a Core i7-7820HQ processor, Full HD matte display, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 512GB M.2 SATA solid state drive (SSD). It costs $1,946.50. (The starting price for the Latitude 5480 is just $769.) See at Dell Dell Latitude 5480 technical specifications Like many business laptops, the 14-inch Latitude 5480's pricing starts off affordably ($769) with very basic and low-end specifications, including a Core i3-7100U dual-core CPU, 4GB of RAM and a 500GB spinning hard disk drive (HDD).

While a lot of variabilities exist for features, the choices are meant to fit the needs and budgets of large IT departments who would buy the Latitude 5480 in bulk. Dell Latitude 5480 design The Latitude 5480 is a throwback to a time when laptops were thicker and more rugged. Built from tough polymer plastics with all an all-matte black finish and plenty of ports, the Latitude 5480 is meant to be deployed in the field and last for years. Starting at just 3.5 lbs (1.60 kg) you cannot call this 14-inch workhorse heavy, but it can creep up as you build out the system. This review unit, for instance, weighs 3.93 lbs (1.78 kg) making it a little hefty. Likewise, at 0.9 inches (22.45 mm) thick the Latitude 5480 is by no means Ultrabook-thin either. That's OK, though, because the full RJ45 Ethernet port in the back is something only possible on thicker laptops that eschew the dongle solution. Opening the display requires two hands, and the dual metal hinge, which lets the display lay at 180 degrees, is meant to last a very long time. The hinge is rather stiff but that's expected for a rugged laptop. While I wouldn't describe the Latitude 5480 as particularly great to look at, it trades that in for extreme pragmatism. It's a laptop built for practical usage and longevity, and it succeeds in that regard. Decent anti-glare display The 14-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) matte in-plane switching (IPS) display is quite good. The text is sharp, and with the anti-glare design it's easy to read, especially at this screen size. Color accuracy, as expected, is not nearly as precise as high-end laptops, but it's not terrible either. In using a colorimeter, the Full HD screen gets 69 percent sRGB and just 57 percent Adobe RGB. Both scores are significantly lower than the HP EliteBook x360 or Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, but those two laptops come in at much higher price points and are not on the same class. Brightness is about 300 nits, which is more than fine for indoor use. But it will struggle outdoors. The matte display helps a bit here, however, compared to glossy screens. Brightness and color are also very even on this display with no hotspots or the light bleed that you find in lower cost screens. Display bezels are beefy on the top allowing room for the camera and infrared (IR) lens and at the bottom to keep the screen off the deck (less looking down), but they are relatively thin on the sides giving an overall slim profile to the Latitude 5480. Approaching the Latitude 5480 as someone who uses it for writing, handling Microsoft Office, and browsing the web, I enjoyed the display. The temperature was a bit on the cool side, but otherwise, I think this is the appropriate screen for this laptop. A keyboard worth typing on The Latitude 5480 has a full-sized, chicklet style keyboard where the black keys are slightly dipped in the center. Secondary functions are labeled in blue, and the two-stage backlighting does an excellent job in low light. In testing many keyboards, including Dell's, I've concluded that I prefer its business versions better than its prosumer XPS ones. The keys on this and other Latitudes seem to have slightly more travel and bounce compared to the consumer line. The slightly curved keys just feel better for typing, as does the larger deck that your palms can rest on. It's also spacious and just fun to use for writing. The keyboard is quiet so it doesn't attract attention if you're busy banging away on the latest project proposal. Overall, the Latitude continues the fine line of Dell keyboards for laptops. I wish some of these optimizations would jump over to the consumer line. Trackpad is weak but pointing stick helps If there is a weak spot with the Latitude 5480, and it's the trackpad. Not only is it not Precision, but it's also not even Synaptics or Elan. This hardware uses some old school generic "Dell Trackpad" mojo, including its software for tweaking. Dell Trackpad software is not the best available. The trackpad itself is made from hard-but-smooth plastic, and it does not click, so it requires taps to engage. It feels decent for not being glass, and I could live with tapping. There are also two physical buttons for right and left clicks – also plastic – that flank the bottom. Assuming you're content with hardware buttons, they're OK. Things begin to break down with the Dell software. I can't find a happy medium for pointer speed, which seems slow. The same goes for acceleration. The Latitude 5480's trackpad is much better than those on other low-cost PCs. I just know Dell can make some great trackpads when it wants to, and it could have done better here. Despite the above, the two-finger scrolling and gestures in Windows 10 were quite good especially for three-finger swipe up (task view) and down (minimize all windows), which worked flawlessly. The pointing stick, a.k.a. "blue nipple," that sits between the G, B and H keys seems satisfactory. I'm not a nav stick user, but the movement was smooth, consistent and I like the feel of it. Three physical buttons sit above the trackpad to act as the right, middle and left clicks for the stick. All ports and no dongles For input and output (I/O), the Latitude 5480 should be more than fine for most modern business uses. For video out, there are HDMI, VGA, and even USB Type-C ports with optional Thunderbolt 3 support. The three USB Type-A ports, with one on the left, right, and in the rear, are ideally positioned for external mice, hubs, or hard drives. The built-in full RJ45 Ethernet port in the back is extremely useful for networking situations. There's even a full SD card reader, complete with a filler card to protect it when not in use. It's rare to find a full SD reader on anything less than 15-inch laptops these days, and it's a nice nod to have it here. And an optional Smartcard reader sits on the left-bottom side for those who require it for security reasons. Overall, there is nothing sexy about the ports on the Latitude 5480, but it is a dongle-less system requiring no external hardware for the full office experience. All those ports result in a thicker laptop for 2017, but the convenience is worth the tradeoff. Camera and Windows Hello Featuring a 720p front-facing the camera with a single IR lens for Windows Hello facial recognition, the Latitude 5480 is on par with most laptops in this class. Camera performance is quite good, with pleasing images and video, though it can be slightly grainy. Windows Hello's bioauthentication works well with the facial recognition, but for some reason the fingerprint reader does not appear to be Windows Hello compatible. Instead, it works with Dell's built-in security software. Audio is better than expected There are two speakers located near the front bottom deck. This placement is similar to what Dell has been using in the XPS and other Latitude series. While it's not as nice as some top firing speakers on the deck, or front-firing like in some gaming laptops, it's better than placement towards the bottom-back like many other designs. The speakers get louder than the XPS series, with solid audio fidelity and even a bit of resonance within the laptop's body. I attribute that to simply having more space in the 0.9-inch main deck, which gives the sound something to bounce off. When placed on a solid surface sound seems to emanate from the keyboard deck itself, which is a neat trick. The quality of the speakers and audio is surprising. It's loud, crisp and better than expected. Audiophiles will cringe, but for those who need to play back videos with clear audio and excellent mid-range, the Latitude 5480 is better than most laptops, even some consumer ones. Battery and performance The Latitude 5480 can ship with multiple battery types (all non-removable) and sizes, including 42 WHr, 51 WHr, and 68 WHr. The unit tested here is the high-end 68Whr, and combined with Energy Star optimizations, the Latitude 5480 – even with a quad-core Core i7 processor – can get seven to eight hours or more on a single charge. And that number can only go on dual-core processor configurations. The same is true for standby, which is exceptional. During some downtime, I left the Latitude unattended for a week, and there was almost zero battery drainage when left on standby. Having long battery life and great standby is critical for such a device, and Dell has done a fantastic job. Regarding performance, the 7th-Generation quad-core Intel "Kaby Lake" i7-7820HQ is a beastly processor. With a baseline of 2.9GHz and turbo to 3.9GHz, the 7820HQ is one of the fastest and most robust mobile processors on the market. Because of that, it should not be surprising to see it top our benchmarks. Geekbench 4.0 benchmarks (higher is better) Device Single Core Multi Core Dell Latitude 5480 4,625 15,401 Dell Precision 5520 (Xeon E3) 4,799 15,055 Dell XPS 15 (9560) Core i7 4,503 13,587 Dell Latitude 7280 4,381 7,935 Dell XPS 13 (9360) Core i7 4,120 7,829 HP Spectre 13 Core i7 4,100 7,469 Surface Book 965M 3,977 7,486 Geekbench 4.0 OpenCL (higher is better) Device Compute Sore Dell Latitude 5480 21,616 Dell Precision 5520 48,724 Dell XPS 13 (9360) 19,410 Surface Book HD520 18,197 Dell Latitude 7280 17,827 For the above OpenCL test, you can see where the Precision 5520's Quadro M1200 card comes into play, dramatically affecting the Geekbench score. Nonetheless, the Intel HD 630 graphics do a decent enough job for a modern workhorse laptop in 2017. The Core i7-7820HQ is so powerful iit can beat out a new Intel Xeon E3-1505M in multi-core and rival it in single-core tests. However, not all Latitude 5480s will score as highly due to the available dual-core configuration options. PCMark - Home Conventional 3.0 Device Score Comparison Dell Latitude 5480 3,397 Better than 67 percent of all results Dell XPS 15 (9560) 3,534 Better than 71 percent of all results Dell Precision 5520 (Xeon) 2,994 Better than 57 percent of all results Dell Latitude 7280 2,829 Better than 52 percent of all results HP Spectre x360 15 2,472 Better than 41 percent of all results Turn to PCMark, and again that quad-core processor pushes the Latitude 5480 to the top of the list with only the powerful XPS 15 (9560) and its NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU edging it out. For storage, the Latitude 5480 can get a very fast PCIe NVMe-type SSD, which is sure to deliver blazing results. The review unit here only uses an M.2 SATA drive, which is more affordable but results in slower speeds. CrystalDiskMark (higher is better) Device Read Write Dell Latitude 5480 SATA 443 MB/s 469 MB/s Razer Blade Pro 2,571 MB/s 2,467 MB/s Dell XPS 15 (9560) 2,207 MB/s 1,628 MB/s Dell XPS 13 (9360) 1,287 MB/s 794 MB/s HP Spectre x360 15 1,128 MB/s 862 MB/s Surface Book 1,018 MB/s 967 MB/s Dell Latitude 7280 SATA 428 MB/s 412 MB/s Dell XPS Tower SE (HDD) 133 MB/s 150 MB/s Comparatively speaking, a SATA drive is significantly faster than a spinning one, and regular users probably won't notice a difference. It also performs similarly to the Latitude 7280, with a comparable storage setup. The Razer Blade Pro is included only to demonstrate the power of an extreme RAID 0 configuration with two of the fastest SSDs on the market today. Overall, the Latitude 5480, when configured with a quad-core processor, is more about CPU cycles and less about graphics and storage performance. Considering this PC is meant for productivity, as opposed to gaming or video production, it puts emphasis on the right parts of the hardware. Under extreme GPU load for 15 minutes the Latitude 5480 can get warm, but it's on par with similar quad-core i7 systems. Finally, for heat and noise, the Latitude 5480 does quite well even with that processor on board. Rarely did the fans kick in when doing regular productivity work, and heat was kept to the lower back area and never became uncomfortable. Under heavy GPU stress for an extended duration the top deck never went above 102 degrees F (39 degrees C) while the bottom vent where the CPU sits maxed at 142 degrees F (61 degrees C), which is on par for a quad-core i7 processor. Conclusion: Dell Latitude 5480 is a budget beast for business The Dell Latitude 5480 is far from an exciting device, but that is not what makes a good business laptop. Depending on how you configure the Latitude 5480, it can either be a ho-hum but robust 14-inch laptop or something that packs a powerful quad-core i7. Built like a "classic" mass deployed device, the Latitude 5480 feels like it can take a beating, which is necessary for its job description, but at just under four pounds, it's not super bulky either. Putting aside aesthetics, the Latitude 5480 excels where it matters: performance. It has a decent display, excellent keyboard, great battery life, and a hearty selection of I/O ports without the need for dongles. The one weakness is the trackpad, which is decent but clearly a step down from what Dell is capable of accomplishing. I wouldn't call the trackpad a deal breaker, but it'd be the first thing I ask for when it comes to future improvements. For those looking to step it up in the 14-inch range with a sleeker more Ultrabook design, Dell has the new Latitude 7480 starting at $1,029. There is also a 12-inch version, which we recently reviewed called the Latitude 7280. For those who want a real high-end graphics-intensive laptop, Dell recently updated the Precision 5520 with newer hardware. See at Dell Pros: Great port selection and no need for dongles. Nice looking anti-glare display. Quad-core and discrete graphics options. Plenty of configuration options for IT departments. Feels durable with great battery life. Good keyboard. Cons: Can get expensive on high-end configurations. Trackpad is below average for speed. Fingerprint reader is hit or miss.

Sign up here.** On the roster: Trump keeps it one hundred - Obama set to re-take the stage - Le Trump? - Power Play: Eat a peach (or a pork rind) - Les Nessman, call your office TRUMP KEEPS IT ONE HUNDRED President Trump expressed frustration today that his administration was being held to the “ridiculous” standard of having its accomplishments measured at the 100-day mark, which he will reach a week from Saturday. And, to be fair, there’s nothing magical about 100 days for American presidents except for that Franklin Roosevelt exploited the concept in 1933 to jam through his agenda. FDR’s successors have, to varying degrees, used the arbitrary timetable as he did: to try to goad Congress into action. That was certainly the direction Trump seemed to be going when he immediately before the 2016 election offered a “Contract with the American Voter” that promised enormous action in the first 100 days. And when Trump says that the 100-day standard is being imposed on him by the press, it sounds a little like what his predecessor claimed about Syria, “I didn’t set a red line. The world set a red line.” Trump’s 18-point list of promises to keep in that span as well as the 10 legislative initiatives he said would be underway are, to say the least, a mixed bag. He has delivered on some, like replacing the late Justice Antonin Scalia and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. On others, not so much. In some cases the failure stems from simplistic or overly broad language like “cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order” from the Obama administration.  Are all the orders unconstitutional? Is he only revoking the unconstitutional ones? Probably intended to be in the eye of the voter… Others have missed the mark because of problems with execution, like Trump’s promise to “suspend immigration from terror-prone regions.” Still others are not complete because Trump changed his mind. Trump said he will not declare China a currency manipulator. He also has rescinded his federal hiring freeze and carved plenty of holes in his restrictions on lobbyists. As for the legislative agenda, there is not much good to say. Trump promised movement on term limits, corruption, taxes, ObamaCare, childcare, education and more. Few have been even proposed and those that have gotten underway, especially TrumpCare, have been a mess. So it is understandable that Trump would like to break the yardstick he set for himself because he can already foresee the horrible coverage that will greet his 99th day in office one week from now. Not a happy thought for a guy who just carded the lowest first-quarter Gallup job approval rating ever. But in addition to mounting an attack on the metric itself, Trump also seems determined to try to at least partly live up to it. How else to explain the frantic action by the administration to simultaneously revive the previously failed TrumpCare initiative and raise the odds of a government shutdown in order to win some symbolic victories in a must-pass government funding package due a week from today. Media maven Trump can obviously foresee the painful moment one week from today as he signs legislation extending current spending levels without any adjustment for his priorities and simultaneously hitting the 100-day mark without a single legislative victory. But the president ought to take his own word for it: The 100-day construct is “ridiculous.” We could have told him that when he promised so much to voters in November. If he and his ever-more-harried team fling themselves at the task of living up to unrealistic promises Trump made to win the election, Trump risks not just a weekend of bad coverage but catastrophic failure. A government shutdown, even a brief one, would convince the country swiftly that the Republican claim to be a governing party is something like sick joke. Couple that with a busted revival of TrumpCare and you have the beginning of an epic tailspin. If Republicans want to keep control of Washington next year, they better get serious about setting priorities and sticking with them. THE RULEBOOK: LOCAL YOKELS “The people of America may be warmly attached to the government of the Union, at times when the particular rulers of particular States, stimulated by the natural rivalship of power, and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement, and supported by a strong faction in each of those States, may be in a very opposite temper.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 59 TIME OUT: HAPPY BIRTHDAY… WEATHER PERMITTING The Telegraph: “Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday celebrations were one of the highlights of 2016, but this year will be a much quieter affair as she prepares to turn 91. … The Queen celebrates her birthday twice each year - once on the anniversary of the day she was born, April 21, and on an ‘official’ birthday in June. … It is a tradition that was started by George II in 1748 and is owes its origins to the ageless problem of the British weather. George was born in November, and felt the weather would be too cold at that time of year for his annual birthday parade. So instead, he combined his birthday celebration with an annual spring military parade known as Trooping the Colour, in which regiments displayed their flags or ‘colours’ so soldiers would be familiar with them. It is a tradition that has continued to this day.” Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions. OBAMA SET TO RE-TAKE THE STAGE Chicago Tribue: “Former President Barack Obama will return to Chicago on Monday to speak to young people at the University of Chicago, in what will be his first public event since leaving the White House. Obama and young leaders will hold a conversation on civic engagement and discuss community organizing at the university's Logan Center for the Arts, his office announced Friday. … About six young people will appear on stage with him for the 11 a.m. discussion, [Spokesman Kevin Lewis] said. The event will be a homecoming for Obama on multiple levels. He formerly taught constitutional law at the U. of C. and his family has a home nearby in the Kenwood neighborhood. It also lets the former president, who came to Chicago to work as a young community organizer, fulfill one of the commitments he set out for his post-presidential years: to engage and work with the country's next generation of leaders, Lewis said.” LE TRUMP? Politico: “Two days before a French election that has Europe on edge, President Donald Trump weighed in Friday with a tweet that seemed to imply support for the controversial far-right populist Marine Le Pen. Trump’s Friday morning tweet responded to a shooting the day before on Paris’s Champs Elysees that outgoing French President Francois Hollande called a likely act of terrorism. ‘Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election!’ Trump wrote. A contender for France’s presidency, Le Pen has made the terrorist threat— particularly from Muslim immigrants to France—a top campaign issues. Until Friday morning, Trump had maintained a studious neutrality in the French vote, despite suspicions throughout Europe that he and his senior strategist Steve Bannon favor Le Pen, a fellow anti-establishment populist.” POWER PLAY: EAT A PEACH (OR A PORK RIND) All eyes were on Georgia’s special election this week that put Republicans on edge, but can you name the last Democrat to represent the Peach State in the U.S. Senate?

They stopped teaching it, and the great cultural transmission belt broke. Now many students, if they encounter it, are taught that Western civilization is a history of oppression. …  All I can say is, if you think that was reactionary and oppressive, wait until you get a load of the world that comes after it.” – David Brooks in his NYT column, “The Crisis of Western Civ.” FROM THE BLEACHERS “I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the ‘sexism’ issue with Clinton.  Maybe I missed something, but I never heard anyone suggest she get back in the kitchen.  In 2008, her defeat was a result of the first Black president trumping the first female president.  President Obama also possessed charm, charisma and a great story....she, not so much.  Her ‘deplorables’ comment, duplicitous nature, among other issues were the cause of her troubles... not her uterus.” – Madeline Schwarz, Wildomar, Calif. [Ed. note: Race was a factor for Obama’s elections, for good and for ill. There were no doubt votes he lost because of his African ancestry but he no doubt won many, if not more, votes because of it. One suspects the same is true for Clinton who exploited her status as the first female major-party nominee in history without surcease. Were there people who voted against Clinton because she was a woman? I’m sure. Were there others, perhaps greater in number, who voted for her because she was a woman? I’m sure. What was galling about Clinton’s overt play on gender, though, was that she used a real problem – actual sexism – to cover for her own failings ethically, politically and managerially. Such selfish exploitation of a legitimate issue is peak Clintonism.]   “Just curious why President Trump has not nominated more judges to fill current vacancies? According to the USCourts.gov website, there are currently 127 judicial vacancies with 20 of those on the Courts of Appeals. 49 of the total vacancies are considered ‘judicial emergencies’.  Considering most of them were vacant when he took office, I'm surprised that he has only found time to make two nominations.  Gorsuch & one currently pending for the Court of Appeals.  Perhaps this is not something scheduled for the first 100 days but it seems like he is missing a golden opportunity in this area.” – Keith Dameron, Lakewood, Colo. [Ed. note: Great point, Mr. Dameron! One of the advantages of the lowered thresholds for confirming judicial appointees is to alleviate overburdened federal courts, especially at the district level. But the process for filing nominations isn’t quite a rubber stamp. Suitable nominees must be found and put forward, usually by officeholders of the party in power. Vetting and confirming these individuals takes time. I would expect at some point in the not-too-distant future, you will see a flotilla of appointments set sail in the Senate. All of the vacancies won’t be addressed but you will likely see dozens in short order.]   “I totally enjoyed your report on Christopher Hitchens and Can Dems Kick The Clinton Habit. For some reason, your comments [Thursday] were right on and provided me hope that not all Americans have the right to being stupid all the time.” – Ray Ingram, Athens, Ala. [Ed. note: I wouldn’t go that far, Mr. Ingram! Americans certainly have the right to be stupid all the time. What they don’t have is the right to be protected from the consequences of their stupidity.

From that point on, it was madness. … Dust was flying, people were getting hit in the head and it was a scene of chaos, [mother Chelsea Gillens] said. … ‘…We got attacked by kids bigger than my 13-year-old, like they had facial hair.’” Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News. Brianna McClelland contributed to this report.

By Tina Amini2017-04-21 10:23:46 -0700 Driverless cars that work are cool, but using another company's work without their permission maybe isn't. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that manufacturers of driverless cars were using video game environments as a testing ground to help teach their cars how to drive themselves. One video game in particular became the go-to for the impressive work that went into its streets: Grand Theft Auto V.  Researchers connected to Intel Labs figured out a way to modify GTAV's engine and algorithms to set up a simulation that would allow companies to track car data on the streets of Los Santos.  The resources needed to test AI on self-driving cars in the real-world are extensive, but a video game environment allows for much easier use. It's not perfect — because, as accurate as the physics in a game can be, it's still not the real world — but it certainly helps move the process along at a faster rate. Researchers can study a car's response to obstacles and various scenarios incrementally, and make changes on the fly as needed. Rinse and repeat. You can't really do that in the real without without spending tons of hours on it. As Bloomberg reported: “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” A fascinating use of technology, to be sure. But Rockstar sent us a statement today highlighting the other side to this. “We welcome discussions about the use of our technology to help further academic research, but it’s obviously not appropriate for corporations to take our work and use it for their own financial interests or for researchers to distribute unlicensed copies of our code as part of their work without first seeking our permission,” the company said.  Technically, no one seems to be directly profiting off of using the GTAV engine just yet. But it certainly paves the way for that to happen. Like, for instance, if companies like Google grab this data to get a leg up on, say, Tesla, who have bragged about the number of hours they've logged testing their driverless cars. Video game modifications have always been a little tricky, legally-speaking, but particularly once money comes into the equation.

With only 115 transistors, their processor isn't going to top any benchmark rankings, but it's "a first step towards the development of microprocessors based on 2D semiconductors," the researchers at Vienna University of Technology said in a paper published in the journal Nature this month. Two-dimensional materials have the benefit of flexibility, meaning that they can be incorporated more easily into wearable devices or connected sensors, and potentially making them less breakable: Picture a smartphone that bends rather than breaks if you drop it. Today's semiconductors and screens are already pretty thin, but they still rely on the three-dimensional physical properties of the materials they're made from in order to function. Bend a silicon wafer and it will crack. But 2D materials like graphene or the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) used by the Vienna researchers, are truly two-dimensional, made with crystals just one layer of atoms or molecules thick, allowing them to flex. TMDs are compounds composed of a transition metal such as molybdenum or tungsten and a chalcogen (typically sulfur, selenium or tellurium, although oxygen is also a chalcogen). Like graphene, they form into layers, but unlike graphene which conducts electricity like a metal, they are semiconductors, which is great news for flexible chip designers. Stefan Wachter, Dmitry Polyushkin and Thomas Mueller of the Institute of Photonics, working with Ole Bethge of the Institute of Solid State Electronics in Vienna, decided to use molybdenum disulfide to build their microprocessor. They deposited two molecule-thick layers of it on a silicon substrate, etched with their circuit design and separated by a layer of aluminium oxide. "The substrate fulfills no other function than acting as a carrier medium and could thus be replaced by glass or any other material, including flexible substrates," they wrote. Recent Intel microprocessors act on data in 64-bit "words," can understand hundreds or even thousands of different instructions, depending on how you count them, and contain hundreds of millions of transistors. In contrast, the microprocessor built by the researchers is only capable of acting on data one bit at a time, using a set of just four instructions (NOP, LDA, AND and OR), and the circuit features used to build it are of the order of 2 micrometers across, 100 times larger than those found in the latest Intel and ARM processors. With more work, though, the microprocessor's complexity could be increased and its size reduced, the researchers said. They deliberately chose an overly large feature size for their manufacturing process to reduce the effects of holes, cracks and contamination in the molybdenum disulfide film and to make it easier to inspect the results with an optical microscope. "We do not see any roadblocks that could prevent the scaling of our 1-bit design to multi-bit data," they said, and only the challenge of lowering contact resistance stands in the way of sub-micrometer manufacturing. That's not to say it will be easy: Although the manufacturing yield for subunits was high, with around 80 percent of the arithmetic-logic units fully functional, their non-fault tolerant design meant only a few percent of finished devices worked properly. Commercial microprocessor manufacturers deal with yield problems by making their chip designs modular, and testing them at a variety of speeds. Chips that work at higher speed fetch higher prices, while faulty subcomponents can be permanently disabled and the resulting chips, otherwise fully functional, sold as lower-spec models. It's taken 46 years for Intel to get from the 4004, a four-bit central processor with 46 instructions, to the latest incarnation of the x86 architecture, Kaby Lake: With all that the industry has learned about micromanufacturing since then, progress with flexible semiconductors may be a little faster.

Eben Upton talks chips, children and the future of tech whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email Walking into the Raspberry Pi Foundation's office, you wouldn't think it housed one of the most influential tech companies of the last decade. Situated on one floor of a small Cambridge building – which resembles a 1970s university library rather than a technological hub – flanked by impressive, modern buildings owned by Microsoft, Deloitte and KPMG, Raspberry Pi’s quietly carries on changing the face of computing. Having started from humble origins, the company behind the £30 microcomputer has gone from strength to strength. It recently celebrated three milestones almost simultaneously: hitting its 5th birthday, its eighth product launch and the sale of its 12 millionth unit. One of the driving forces behind Raspberry Pi Foundation’s success is Eben Upton, the founder and mastermind behind the Raspberry Pi. With stints at Broadcom, Intel and IBM - not to mention a three-year tenure as Cambridge University's director of studies for computer science - Upton has an impressive technical pedigree behind him. That knowledge quickly becomes evident upon talking to him and it’s immediately clear that the Raspberry Pi is the definition of a passion project for Upton. His eyes light up when speaking about the engineering problems and you can feel his boundless enthusiasm for all things technical ooze out of every pore. Habitually dressed in jeans and rolled-up shirtsleeves, Upton's demeanour is a cross between a well-liked sixth form teacher and a starry-eyed Silicon valley programmer. I get the impression that this isn't a carefully-crafted look of artificial nonchalance commonly worn by tech CEOs, but a genuine result of Upton getting his hands dirty with the day-to-day grunt work of engineering alongside the rest of his staff. He dismissed the idea of working on shiny new technologies like AI, saying (with obvious relish) "the stuff we're good at tends to be grungy, low-level systems programming". It's this passion that’s driven the Raspberry Pi Foundation since the beginning. Founded as a way to get more kids into computing at an earlier age, the Foundation has always been motivated by its values rather than its bottom line. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Raspberry Pi Zero – a fully functional computer priced at a mind-boggling $5. Roughly the size of a packet of chewing gum, the Zero is Upton's favourite product – a fact given away by the beaming grin that breaks out across his face when I first bring it up in conversation. "I made a million computers," Upton points out, "and I turned over five million dollars." For any other tech company, selling a product that cheaply would be lunacy. For Upton, though, the very concept of how howlingly insane a business move it was is part of the reason why he’s so fond of the Zero. "I love that we were able to do it," he says; "I love that it worked." In many ways, the Raspberry Pi Zero is emblematic of the company as a whole. The first Pi models were a runaway hit but, rather than resting on their laurels, Upton and his team went and built the world's smallest commercial PC purely for fun. "It was just wonderful to be able to take a business that was going well and still be aggressive enough to say 'what happens if we just tear it up and do something else?'" With all this hardware innovation going on, it's easy to forget that devices like the Zero are effectively a side project for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. "You've got to remember that actually, in the end, we're a charity," Upton says. The foundation was set up with the aim of getting kids into computing, but its efforts don't stop at making cheaply available hardware for them to practise on. Outside of the hardware business, the Foundation puts most of its focus on grassroots education projects like Code Club. Following its acquisition in 2015, Raspberry Pi owns and operates Code Club as a subsidiary, setting up volunteer-staffed after-school clubs to teach kids about programming, computing and other digital skills. "Code Club is amazing. What never fails to astound me is the number of kids – there's over 5,000 Code Clubs in the UK, we've reached about 75,000 kids." Video of What Does a Code Club look like? "We've got to the point where more than half of the schools [in our age bracket] Code Clubs," Upton says. "It changes what the question is. The question isn't 'what's a Code Club?', the question for a parent is 'why doesn't my school have a Code Club? Because my friend's child's school has a Code Club?'" Not only has Code Club proved to be a huge success over here, it's also expanded internationally. There are hundreds of franchised Code Clubs in countries including Australia, South Korea and Brazil, all of which are working within their communities to get kids working with computers at an earlier age. Upton's goal with Code Club, he says, is "finishing off the UK". While he acknowledged the changing nature of tech means the job's never “done”, his aim is to reach the point where there's a Code Club in every school. This, along with the Foundation's other efforts, like its Picademy teacher training programme, is geared towards combatting the tech industry's burgeoning skills shortage. In particular, Upton is aiming to bring more girls into the tech workforce, which continues to struggle with a serious gender imbalance. "It's the single thing you can change," he says. "Participation rates among women are so low that if you got them up to the same level as they are already among men, then you’d effectively be doubling your workforce. If there's one bit of low-hanging fruit, that's the one." He's aiming to fix this problem through getting girls invested at an earlier age. It appears to be going well; roughly 40% of Code Club attendees are girls, a proportion that far outstrips most tech firms. "The reason it's nice that we're doing this intervention around Code Club at nine to 11 is that is a window where if you can get a girl to the end [of it] and she's still excited about [tech], there's every chance that she'll continue to be excited about it all the way through her career." The progress of the five-year-old foundation is impressive but, for Upton, the important thing is that it's built to last. The way the Foundation is governed has recently been revamped in order to make it self-sustaining. Under the new organisation, the foundation maintains a broad pool of expert members, who are elected by their fellow members to join the board of trustees. The first trustee to be elected under this new system is Dr. Tilly Blyth, head of collections and principal curator at the Science Museum in London. "That gives us some confidence that we're in this for the long run," he says. "We're trying to build an organisation that's going to outlive me; if this organisation dies before I do, I will be very unhappy. You don't want to be predeceased by your children and you don't want to be predeceased by your charitable foundations." So is all this effort paying off? Well, early signs would suggest that it is. The dip in university admissions for computing courses – the problem the foundation was originally created to solve – has reversed. In fact, since its creation in 2012, applications to Cambridge's computer science course have doubled. Upton's witnessed the impact of his efforts first-hand. "When I used to interview people, it used to take me an afternoon to interview my people for my college. I bumped into my successor in a bar after interviews last year, and it was the end of the week, and he was leaning on the bar; he'd had 42 applicants, I used to have six. He was leaning on the bar with a pint of beer, completely ashen-faced," he laughs, "so I've ruined his life!"

Eben Upton exudes passion. From corporate governance to product design to outreach initiatives, it's clear there isn't a single element of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's work which doesn't utterly captivate him. The company he created is thriving and he appears to be accomplishing that most elusive of Silicon Valley goals: making the world a better place. So what's next for the baker of the Raspberry Pi? Founding another startup? Political ambitions, perhaps? According to Upton, working at Raspberry Pi is just too much fun to pass up. "What's not to like: surround yourself with a staff of easy-going geniuses and build great toys all day long! So I'm still here, and while it's still fun, I'll be here." whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email Read more about Business You are here: Home Business What comes next after the Raspberry Pi?

Twitter Facebook Researchers build a microprocessor from flexible materials It's a one-bit microprocessor with four instructions, but it could open the way to more flexible electronics Peter Sayer (IDG News Service) 22 April, 2017 02:36 - - - - print email Comments Researchers have built a primitive microprocessor out of a two-dimensional material similar to graphene, the flexible conductive wonder material that some believe will revolutionize the design and manufacture of batteries, sensors and chips. With only 115 transistors, their processor isn't going to top any benchmark rankings, but it's "a first step towards the development of microprocessors based on 2D semiconductors," the researchers at Vienna University of Technology said in a paper published in the journal Nature this month. Two-dimensional materials have the benefit of flexibility, meaning that they can be incorporated more easily into wearable devices or connected sensors, and potentially making them less breakable: Picture a smartphone that bends rather than breaks if you drop it. Today's semiconductors and screens are already pretty thin, but they still rely on the three-dimensional physical properties of the materials they're made from in order to function. Bend a silicon wafer and it will crack. But 2D materials like graphene or the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) used by the Vienna researchers, are truly two-dimensional, made with crystals just one layer of atoms or molecules thick, allowing them to flex. TMDs are compounds composed of a transition metal such as molybdenum or tungsten and a chalcogen (typically sulfur, selenium or tellurium, although oxygen is also a chalcogen). Like graphene, they form into layers, but unlike graphene which conducts electricity like a metal, they are semiconductors, which is great news for flexible chip designers. Stefan Wachter, Dmitry Polyushkin and Thomas Mueller of the Institute of Photonics, working with Ole Bethge of the Institute of Solid State Electronics in Vienna, decided to use molybdenum disulfide to build their microprocessor. They deposited two molecule-thick layers of it on a silicon substrate, etched with their circuit design and separated by a layer of aluminium oxide. "The substrate fulfills no other function than acting as a carrier medium and could thus be replaced by glass or any other material, including flexible substrates," they wrote. Recent Intel microprocessors act on data in 64-bit "words," can understand hundreds or even thousands of different instructions, depending on how you count them, and contain hundreds of millions of transistors. In contrast, the microprocessor built by the researchers is only capable of acting on data one bit at a time, using a set of just four instructions (NOP, LDA, AND and OR), and the circuit features used to build it are of the order of 2 micrometers across, 100 times larger than those found in the latest Intel and ARM processors. With more work, though, the microprocessor's complexity could be increased and its size reduced, the researchers said. They deliberately chose an overly large feature size for their manufacturing process to reduce the effects of holes, cracks and contamination in the molybdenum disulfide film and to make it easier to inspect the results with an optical microscope. "We do not see any roadblocks that could prevent the scaling of our 1-bit design to multi-bit data," they said, and only the challenge of lowering contact resistance stands in the way of sub-micrometer manufacturing. That's not to say it will be easy: Although the manufacturing yield for subunits was high, with around 80 percent of the arithmetic-logic units fully functional, their non-fault tolerant design meant only a few percent of finished devices worked properly. Commercial microprocessor manufacturers deal with yield problems by making their chip designs modular, and testing them at a variety of speeds. Chips that work at higher speed fetch higher prices, while faulty subcomponents can be permanently disabled and the resulting chips, otherwise fully functional, sold as lower-spec models. It's taken 46 years for Intel to get from the 4004, a four-bit central processor with 46 instructions, to the latest incarnation of the x86 architecture, Kaby Lake: With all that the industry has learned about micromanufacturing since then, progress with flexible semiconductors may be a little faster. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Snapdragon 835 Windows machines coming in the… Snapdragon 835 Windows machines coming in the fourth quarter of this year By Jon Martindale — April 21, 2017 8:53 AM Subscribe Share Adam Shah/IDG News Service Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Qualcomm chips are powerful and could offer a new avenue for competition for the laptop and tablet market. We’ve been hearing rumors about Windows 10 systems running on ARM processors since the tail end of last year, with only the vaguest of hints about when they might actually arrive. In an earnings call this week, however, Qualcomm CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, made it clear that we can expect the first machines to arrive in the fourth quarter of this year. Although traditionally, desktops and laptops running Windows 10 have been powered by Intel and AMD processors, with the ever-evolving nature of competitor hardware like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon line — which uses ARM architecture — that won’t last forever. Indeed, now it seems like we’re mere months away from ARM hardware finding its way to the heart of new Windows machines. “We have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the PC and the data center,” Mollenkopf said during an April 19 earnings call, transcribed by SeekingAlpha (via PCWorld). “Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into Mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year.” While that doesn’t signal a crusade against the traditional Windows 10 desktop, it looks like Qualcomm-powered laptops and/or tablets will be coming to the Windows sphere by the end of the year. Considering the Snapdragon processors with their ARM RISC instruction sets are designed around mobile hardware, a highly portable Windows 10 machine would be a good fit for a first generation of Windows device powered by Qualcomm hardware. We don’t have the complete specifics of such a device, though it has been termed a ‘cellular PC’ and will feature high-end smartphone features like Bluetooth 5 support and possibly even WiGig, both of which are natively supported by the Snapdragon 835 chip. These devices are likely to be manufactured in small numbers to start with as Qualcomm tests the water to see how popular they would be. However, as a dominant force in the smartphone business, Qualcomm could find expansion into companion markets like laptops and even eventually low-power desktop machines easier in the long run. Qualcomm is already planning to take on Intel in the server market with its Centriq 2400, 48-core server chips. It also seems like no coincidence that Qualcomm is looking to cosy up to a major platform provider like Microsoft as its relationship with Apple turns sour.

The device was developed with input from the community, and funded through an Indiegogo campaign in November, which reached its target in just one hour. Originally aiming for $75,000, the company has since raised over $1.4 million. Previously referred to by its development codename 'Pyramid Flipper', the device will launch as the Eve V, featuring a range of desirable specs and features. The Indiegogo campaign originally estimated that shipments would begin in February, but that schedule has clearly slipped. However, the company said that it will begin its "first pilot production run at the actual factory floor on 25th of April" to ensure that its production process runs smoothly, before ramping up for larger-scale assembly. Eve explained that "this stage will take us around 10 days and then assembly of the remaining units will take 2-3 days more after which they will be immediately shipped", adding: We will start production of second batch of units immediately after first batch is produced. Second batch production is as before planned to be done in 30 days. We are considering splitting up production runs for the 2nd batch so like producing 500 devices first and shipping them 2 weeks after the first batch, making 500 more and shipping them few days later and so on before all 2000 devices are produced. This would help us to ship part of the limited birds faster than in 30 days! The exact timeline of the second batch will become clear after the first batch is produced. Eve also said that "each screen will be calibrated individually" in partnership with US firm Portrait Displays, "to make sure each and every V leaving [the] factory floor will follow our color calibration requirements." The Eve V is similar in concept to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, with a tablet form factor and retractable kickstand, along with a detachable keyboard. But the Eve device offers some even more attractive features than the Surface, including a wireless mode for the keyboard, so that it can be used without being directly connected to the tablet; USB 3.1 Type-C ports; and Intel's latest 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) processors. Here's an overview of the Eve V's key specs: 12.3-inch IGZO LCD with 2736x1824px resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core m3, i5 or i7 processor 8GB or 16GB LPDDR3 RAM 128GB, 256GB or 512GB SSD storage 2MP front-facing camera 5MP rear camera 802.11ac Wi-Fi with 2x2 MU-MIMO Bluetooth 4.2 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3 support 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C port (Gen1) 2 x USB 3.1 Type-A port 3.5mm audio port microSDXC card reader 2 x noise-cancelling microphones 4 x 1W speakers Fingerprint sensor, hall sensor, gravity sensor, light sensor, gyroscope GPS N-trig stylus (Surface-compatible) with two buttons, and 1024 pressure levels Keyboard with Pogo-pin connectors and wireless connectivity; backlight; glass Clickpad by Synaptics Up to 15 hours of battery life 'Early bird' pricing for the Eve V has now ended, so full pricing will apply for future sales. You can find details of the cost and configurations for each model here. The company's CEO, Konstantinos Karatsevidis, referred to the Eve V, with tongue-in-cheek, as a 'Surface-killer' in an interview with Neowin last year. Microsoft is likely to launch its new Surface Pro 5 in the next few weeks, but the device is not expected to differ significantly from its predecessor, featuring a similar design to the Pro 4, along with new Kaby Lake processors.

Smith Apr 21, 2017, 8:00 AM Volta V in Best Gaming Desktops 2017 The good Stylish, eco-friendly design Strong overall and graphics performance Runs very quiet The bad Not a lot of customization 4K gaming is mixed Verdict The Volta V delivers strong gaming performance in a striking, environmentally-friendly chassis. 8/10 Totally worth it $1999.00 Volta At first glance, the Volta V (starting at $1,999; reviewed at $2,885) looks more hipster than gamer with its slick walnut case. But don't sleep on it — this small, environmentally-friendly PC has more than enough power to support most of your gaming, VR and productivity needs. It's a great departure for gamers who are tired of the same old flashing lights on every gaming desktop — or are just woke AF. Design: Eco-Friendly Chic The Volta V looks more like a miniature version of one of those swanky '60s coffee tables than a badass gaming rig — and that's the biggest part of the appeal. Instead of delivering light shows, metal and glass, the Volta V has a case made from American hardwood (walnut, in this case), aluminum and 3D-printed steel. There is a bit of plastic in the makeup, but it's hidden from prying eyes in the interior of the case. If walnut's not your thing, you can get the system in bamboo. In short, this desktop is eco-friendly chic. Because the paneling is made out of wood, it is prone to expanding and contracting due to moisture or dryness in its environment.. So if you were thinking about using the Volta V in a particularly humid or arid environment, you might want to reconsider. The front panel juts out slightly and reminds me of a cabinet, so much so that I tried pulling it out on several occasions. There's a small silver-aluminum lightning-bolt emblem in the lower-left corner for a nice — but not over-the-top — piece of flair. The sides and most of the rear panel are made of more luscious walnut. The bottom of the desktop is made of aluminum, with two large nylon dust filters attached via magnet. The system stands on a pair of black aluminum feet, allowing for enough space to slide a keyboard underneath when it's not in use. The legs are sturdy enough to support a monitor up to 30 pounds placed on top of the Volta V. Even though I do love a hefty mid or full tower, the Volta V's slight dimensions speak to my rather small New York City apartment. At 15.8 pounds and 20.3 x 11.9 x 3.9 inches, the Volta V would look nice in a living room or on a work desk. It's thicker than the MSI Trident (7 pounds, 13.6 x 3.8 x 2.8 inches) but thinner than the Corsair One (15.8 pounds, 14.9 x 7.9 x 6.9 inches) and the Maingear Drift (35 pounds, 18.3 x 15.11 x 5.8 inches). Ports and Upgradability: Just Pop the Top In the interest of cord and space management, the Volta V's ports are seated deeper inside the case than I'm used to. You get four USB 3.0 ports, three USB 3.1 ports, HDMI-in and Gigabit Ethernet. Your single GPU has its three DisplayPorts and one HDMI-out port, and there are a number of audio outputs, including headphone, microphone and the optical digital out jack. For gamers holding on to their decades-old peripherals, Volta V packs a PS/2 port. The company also placed a couple more USB 3.0 and audio ports along the system's right, along with the silver steel power button. To get that sweet, sweet cord management going, you're going to have to thread your peripherals into the system. Thankfully, all you have to do to access your ports (and other components) is remove the desktop's top, which I'm happy to report requires nothing more than lifting the panel from the case. From there, you can easily swap out components. MORE: The Best Gaming Desktops Available Now Gaming and VR Performance: Better Than Average The Volta V is outfitted with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU with 8GB of VRAM, which means that it can reliably deliver great frame rates at 1080p and mixed performance at 4K. However, like its more powerful brethren, the 1070 is a beast on VR, which means you can expect a smooth gaming experience when you strap on your Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Even as I teleported from spot to spot, dismembering brightly colored automatons in Robo Recall, there were no nausea-inducing stutters. Even as I teleported from spot to spot, dismembering brightly colored automatons in Robo Recall, there were no nausea-inducing stutters. When we ran the SteamVR Performance test, the desktop maxed out the score at 11, matching the One (GTX 1080) and the Drift (GTX Titan X) while beating the 10.6 desktop average. The Trident and its GTX 1060 GPU produced a score of 7.3. The Volta V held its own on some of our more rigorous benchmarks, putting down 112 frames per second on the Hitman test (1080p on Very High). This trounced the 86-fps average and the Trident's 78 fps. However, the Drift and the One notched higher scores of 141 fps and 129 fps, respectively, with their more powerful GPUs. The Volta V's frame rate took a big hit when we switched over to 4K (3840 x 2160), dropping to 49 fps, while the One fell to 79 fps. When I played Mass Effect: Andromeda on Ultra at 4K, the system averaged 22 fps, which is below our 30-fps playability threshold. I managed to hit 30 fps on High and 35 fps on Medium. Compare that to the 51 fps the desktop delivered on Ultra on 1080p, and there's a clear difference. On the Rise of the Tomb Raider test, the Volta V obtained 56 fps at 1080p, which is a little short of the 58-fps average but better than the Trident's 32 fps. Meanwhile, the Drift and the One reached 91 fps and 72 fps, respectively. During the Grand Theft Auto V benchmark, the Volta V got 70 fps, missing the 81-fps average while dispatching the Trident's 30 fps. The Drift notched an insane 115 fps. Overall Performance: A Speedy Powerhouse Need to update a massive spreadsheet while watching your favorite livestream and editing a few photos? The Volta V's overclocked 4.2-GHz Intel Core i7-7700K CPU with 16GB of RAM has it covered and then some. I actually had 40 tabs open in Google Chrome, some of which were streaming Netflix and running TweetDeck. I also started up a full system scan in Windows Defender while playing Asphalt 8 and never saw a hiccup. The desktop also performed well on our synthetic benchmarks, scoring 19,225 on the Geekbench 4 overall performance test and surpassing the 16,663 desktop average. The One, which also has a i7-7700K CPU, notched 17,755, while the Trident and its last-generation Intel Core i7-6700K CPU delivered 12,953. But the Drift and its overclocked Intel Core i7-6950X CPU achieved a monstrous 25,777. When we tested the Volta's file-transfer speeds, its 512GB NVMe PCIe solid-state drive copied 4.97GB of multimedia files in 9 seconds, for a speedy 565.5 megabytes per second. That score demolished the 298.3-MBps average, and also topped the Drift (dual 250GB SSDs), the One (480GB SSD) and the Trident (128GB SSD), which produced speeds of 363.5 MBps, 236.6 MBps and 133.9 MBps, respectively. The Volta V continued its speedy ways on the OpenOffice Spreadsheet Macro test, pairing 20,000 names and addresses in 2 minutes and 31 seconds. That's faster than the 3:18 desktop average as well as the times put up by the Trident (3:12) and the Drift (3:01). MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops Heat: Cool Confidence Even when I was in the heat of battle during Mass Effect: Andromeda, the Volta V managed to stay relatively cool thanks to its liquid cooling module. After I fought Kett for 15 minutes, the rear-mounted fans blew 101 degrees Fahrenheit. That's above our 95-degree comfort threshold, but no one's going to be placing this machine on their lap. And whether I was playing a traditional game or a VR title, the fans were almost whisper quiet.   Software: Keeping It Light The Volta V is light on bloatware, as any good desktop should be. There are a few flies in the ointment, such as Candy Crush Soda Saga, Facebook and Twitter. Nvidia GeForce Experience is the only gaming software, bundling up a bunch of gamer-focused features, such as Battery Boost and Game Optimization, into one easy spot. The Volta V includes lifetime service and tech support and a one-year parts warranty. Configurations I had a great time playing with the $2,885 model of the Volta V, which has an Intel Core i7-7700K CPU with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe PCIe SSD and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU with 8GB of VRAM. The $1,999 base model features a 3.0-GHz Intel core i5-7400 GPU, 8GB of RAM, a 250GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU with 2GB of VRAM. For folks with deeper pockets, there's the $3,969 iteration, which has an overclocked Intel Core i7-6900K processor, 32GB of RAM, a 500GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU with 8GB of VRAM. Although the Volta V offers several customization options — including for the motherboard, type of wood, CPU and GPUs — the well isn't as deep as what boutique companies such as Maingear and Origin offer. MORE: Our Favorite Gaming Keyboards Bottom Line The Volta V isn't your average desktop. Made from wood and other environmentally safe materials, the desktop PC has eco-friendly cred for days. But don't you dare write it off as a lightweight when it comes to gaming. Sporting an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and a powerful Core i7 processor, the Volta V lets you help save the real world at the same time you liberate virtual kingdoms and galaxies. However, if you're looking to confidently play 4K games, you might want to step up to the $2,898 model with the Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. And if you're looking for something a bit flashier, you might want to take a gander at the Maingear Drift, which starts at $1,299. Still, if you want a slick, retro-looking system with equally impressive power and looks (with some eco-friendliness thrown in), the Volta V deserves your attention.

So who will develop, safeguard and store digital IDs? FILE: Picture: EWN. World Economic Forum Internet of things Finternet Email Print Tweet Share World Economic Forum | 17 hours ago Driverless cars that make per-minute toll road payments. Lightbulbs that decide the right energy vendor at a given time and price. Investment decisions made by robo-advisors. And products created in-situ by 3D printers, with royalties paid in real time on whatever intellectual property is needed. This is the coming world of the Internet of Everything, as intelligence and connectivity become distributed more and more widely across our economy. Everything will talk to everything and end-points will make their own decisions, powered by sensor-driven data collection and computing that continually improves, known as machine learning. To make this a reality, we will need a well-functioning, secure micropayments system. We must reimagine the nature of financial assets, digital assets, rights management, intellectual property and royalties. “Sensor technologies and the collection and exchange of data by the Internet of Things will require a fundamental rethink of financial services,” says Udayan Goyal, a London-based private-equity and venture capital investor focused on financial services. If they aren’t careful, banks could be relegated in this new world to becoming mere clearing houses. Credit card and insurance companies could see business shrink. So traditional financial services companies are seeking a role for themselves at the nexus of the digital economy. Getting a pole position in the evolving IoT would allow banks to gain new revenue from a range of innovative services. “In the IoT, payments become a kind of backbeat to life. They are everywhere, but they retreat from view. Your car will be connected to your debit card and will settle your gas charges for you. And your house will settle your utility bills,” says former Deutsche Bank executive Dan Marovitz, COO of Earthport, a London-based company building an alternative to correspondent banking. “The reality is that most payments are still made through banks and most people still keep their money in banks, so the banks will necessarily be part of these future flows.” But the way forward is rife with challenges. Will banks be the brokers of digital data? Digital identity, data management and data privacy are key components of the IoT. People, devices and the software that makes up systems, applications and services will all have to be defined and given a digital identity. So who will develop, safeguard and store digital IDs? In the past, powerful Silicon Valley players tried and failed to play a key role in securing and disseminating data. Microsoft attempted a centralised digital identity service 14 years ago with its Passport and Hailstorm initiatives. Intel, Sun, Oracle and AOL tried to develop their own such service around the same time through a group called the Liberty Alliance. Today, Facebook has vast stores of personal data, though for the most part it has so far shied away from financial services. Now data is a valuable digital asset on a par with capital. Many believe that banks, not Silicon Valley companies, may be best placed to create and safeguard our digital identities and be brokers for data exchange. They could potentially offer services for identity, privacy, and security to accompany the global trading of any digital asset. If smart developers can build apps on top of data that its owners give permission to use, taking into account an individual or organisation’s preferences, it could usher in many types of new financial services. For example, access to commercial and transaction data, via the Internet of Things and point-of-sale systems, could help banks assess the creditworthiness of people and businesses. They could anticipate the need for capital, pre-empting requests for financing from small businesses and providing real-time credit, according to a Fintech 2.0 white paper prepared by Santander Innoventures, Oliver Wyman and Anthemis (the venture and advisory firm founded by London’s Udayan Goyal). New consumer services could crunch data about individuals’ purchases, payment and habits. That may make people smarter financially, much as weaving together health records with dietary and exercise tracking is likely to make us healthier. Consumers could marshal their data to signal an intent to purchase directly to retailers, potentially attracting better offers. And the IoT may literally make form-filling obsolete, reclaiming tens of billions of wasted hours annually across the globe. With such future services in mind, a dozen banks - including Citi, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and JP Morgan Chase - began in 2011 to work with The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), a cooperative that handles transactions like wire transfers for thousands of banks. They envisioned an underlying global financial infrastructure called the Digital Asset Grid (or DAG) to bring bank-grade identity, privacy and security to the global exchange of any digital asset. But the project was later abandoned. The obstacles were bigger than just getting many large institutions to cooperate. Something like the DAG would require banks to think and operate like a company like Apple, offering a platform on top of which others could create new innovative services. Banks may not be able to shed the outdated and arrogant thinking that comes from keeping a physical valuation in the basement. Also, many big banks still lack the digital infrastructure necessary to operate in the emerging IoT. Francisco Gonzalez, CEO of Spanish banking giant BBVA and a former computer programmer, says “In order to compete in the digital world you need to have platforms that perform in real time, and not run batch processes overnight. But behind the scenes, most banks still have what we call a ‘spaghetti platform’.” (Obviously, he excludes his own company, which has aggressively invested in digital banking.) Still, the World Economic Forum argues in an August 2016 report that financial institutions are well positioned to drive digital identity systems since they already have well-developed ways to verify user information for commercial and regulatory purposes. There is a strong business case for banks to move into such services, says WEF. Doing so would allow banks to offer extended financial advisory services and things like behaviour-based insurance. Banks could also offer “identity-as-a-service” to businesses that can’t or don’t wish to store their clients’ personal data. And, they could potentially offer identity management as a separate, fee-based service. One thing is sure: digital identity will be a key part of financial services going forward. The topic took centre stage this year at Sibos, a major annual financial industry conference organised by Swift that convenes more than 7,000 financial services executives. Says Carlos Menendez, Mastercard’s president of enterprise partnerships: “Money is now more than an exchange of value and payment. Further information can be embedded with each transaction in the form of a digital ID.” And digital IDs will have far more utility than merely improving security. “Identity and authentication schemes coupled with payment platforms can enable financial inclusion and poverty alleviation for billions of people,” says Kosta Peric, Deputy Director, and Financial Services for the Poor, at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, who worked on the WEF report on digital identity. “Ultimately, digital services such as data lockers will become the fundamental fabric of the digital society, and also a new, immense, opportunity to provide existing and new government and financial services,” he says. The dark side of data Once digital IDs are ubiquitous and most of the things we own are connected to the Net, more and more information will be traded about us. The challenge will be keeping all that information under control. “The question for the not-so-far future is ‘What will a data market look like? Who will shape the rules? And how will rules be enforced?’,” asks Aurelie Pols, a data governance and privacy advocate at Krux Digital, a venture-backed San Francisco company that aims to unify data about people into a single view to help businesses. Pols is also an advisor on ethics to the Data Protection Supervisor established 15 years ago by the European Union. The Internet of Things is a major step towards the long heralded - and feared - path to truly personalised marketing. It is rich with promise at the same time it is fraught with complexity and the risk of intrusion. Cars, watches, refrigerators, and garage door openers will become nodes on the network, controllable with a smartphone and trailing what Earthport’s Marovitz calls a “digital slipstream.” The endless resulting flow of purchases, preferences and decisions will define a very specific demographic - you. Companies of many types may thus acquire an invaluable resource. “The way the financial services industry thinks about risk will fundamentally change as a result of the availability of the very granular data that can be collected through IoT devices,” says investor Goyal, who in addition to being a VC is managing partner of private equity firm Apis Partners. The way insurance works could change dramatically. Continues Goyal: “The data collected from smart devices and wearable technology will be useful in redefining risk models for life insurers.” That sounds good for them, but maybe not so good for you. Similarly, connected vehicles will enable new risk models for auto insurance. Several insurers already offer policies in which a driver’s behaviour is monitored while he or she drives, with the information transmitted directly to the insurer. The company assesses the chances that driver will have an accident and charges premiums accordingly. On the one hand, those who drive well should get lower rates. But the use of highly personalised data will potentially aid the creation of what Goyal calls “tail exclusion risks.” If you are perceived as risky as your personal data becomes exposed you may become completely uninsurable, he explains. And when lots of information about your health and other personal details is shared freely by companies and government that could also have a dark side. Principles and data ethics need to be established and new technical innovations will be required so that permissions can flow with the data to make clear who can access what and when, says Krux Digital’s Pols. Many startups are pursuing ways to give control of personal information back to the individual, but it’s a dauntingly difficult task. Ethical and security issues When artificial intelligence gets added to the Internet of Things, as it inevitably will, the challenges will become even greater. The question of who will shape and enforce the rules is no clearer for AI than it is for data governance. But the combination of the IoT and AI is expected to usher in new personalised financial services like smart wallets that monitor and learn your habits and needs and alert and coach you to adjust your spending and saving behaviour. Or automated agents may assist you, over the network, to determine your insurance needs, or provide financial advice and portfolio management. As these systems, because more autonomous and reliance on them increases, we will need safeguards. Once a system becomes automated, positive feedback loops may develop and create problems like asset bubbles or market crashes. Autonomous AI can also lead to other unintended consequences, raising ethical and legal issues. In addition to the introduction of new services, the IoT will also lead to more transparency and efficiency, especially in trade, both locally and globally. The blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, could add unprecedented levels of security and authentication when it comes to things like tracking the whereabouts, ownership and condition of assets of all sorts. Says the 2015 Fintech 2.0 white paper: “We expect the IoT, combined with the distributed ledger and smart contracts, to dramatically reduce the costs of trade finance.” International trade is expected to grow by 8% per year by 2020, with associated finance revenues growing to $70 billion, according to the Fintech 2.0 report. “This represents a massive opportunity for both banks and fintech start-ups to…streamline trade finance processes,” it continues. Big financial organisations are trying to adapt by reaching out to small, more agile companies. Everledger, a London-based startup that uses blockchain technology to monitor the supply chain for diamonds and other precious stones sold at retail, has partnered with Mastercard. And BlockVerify, another London start-up that uses blockchain technology to improve anti-counterfeit measures in supply chains, is part of Startupbootcamp Fintech, supported by Rabobank and Lloyds banking group. As the IoT connects things like light bulbs in a home and integrates them into the network, the bulbs themselves may be able to negotiate the most favourable price for electricity from competitive power grids. Visa envisions lightbulbs paying for electricity only when they consume it. And rather than a single payment, the bulb pays continually and incrementally. This will require a new type of currency for ultra-tiny transactions. The digital currencies Bitcoin or Ethereum’s Ether may work for this, as well as paying for tiny chunks of bandwidth, storage, or CPU time in a computer, or energy and sensor data. Visa Europe is running a trial of such micropayment systems with Berlin-based SatoshiPay. But investor Goyal wonders “What happens if these micropayments get hacked?” The security and efficiency of such systems must be reassuringly reliable, but they aren’t yet. And financial services companies will need to do more. The companies that win in the networked economy will not just process transactions but must leverage the rich information in the electronic trail clients leave behind - the so-called digital slipstream, explains Earthport’s Marovitz. If banks become trusted brokers of our data and figure out how to leverage our digital breadcrumbs, the Web could be transformed from a place where people go to visit sites and be tracked without their knowledge, to one where we give permission to know what we are doing and that helps automate our lives. For example, say a consumer wants a car. Today she uses a bank network to send the payment. In the future, with banks as digital brokers, she could let it be known digitally that she is shopping for a car, a process known as “intent casting.” Others on the grid, like dealers or insurance companies, could pitch her in real-time, and she could filter those pitches based on their digital reputations. When she makes the purchase, the information for the paperwork to buy, insure and register the car could be released from her account, securely and with her permission, so it could go to relevant parties. She could also, if she chooses, authorise her data for third-party warranty services. In this scenario- originally envisioned by the Swift industry project - banks would take a cut for brokering these kinds of exchanges. When the IoT network is in full swing we may even be able to text our car and tell it to go sell or rent itself. When we do, a data broker - which may or may not be a bank - will make money managing millions of such transactions. This article was republished courtesy of the World Economic Forum.

(NVDA) Stock Rating Lowered by Zacks Investment Research April 21st, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Latisha Jones Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet NVIDIA Co. (NASDAQ:NVDA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research note issued on Wednesday. According to Zacks, “NVIDIA offers digital media processors and related software for a wide range of visual computing platforms. A look at NVIDIA’s three-months price performance shows that the company has underperformed the Zacks categorized Semiconductor-General industry. The downside can be attributed to cautious forward-looking prospects of the PC industry, made by the research firms IDC and Gartner. Both firms agreed that the recent surge in DRAM prices and short supply of SSD will lead to an increase in PC prices. Going forward, competition from the likes of Intel and QUALCOMM Inc. adds to the woes. Nonetheless, NVIDIA’s sustained efforts toward attaining robust position in several emerging industries such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning and driverless cars industry remain the positives.” A number of other equities analysts have also recently commented on NVDA.

And not only does Apple probably knows it sucks, it even admitted to having chosen form than functionality on the new design. To compensate, it then announced massive price reductions on the current line. It also told the world that it is currently working on the Mac Pro 2018 that will be fundamentally different from the current generation. In a recent round table meeting with a number of tech journalists, Apple almost openly admitted that it made a mistake on the Mac Pro’s current design. In fact, it even apologized for not including proper cooling and upgradability on the build. Nevertheless, Apple promised that the Mac Pro 2018 will be totally different from the previous one. Mac Pro 2018 modular design The first thing worth mentioning is the fact that Apple is going back to the old modular design of the Mac Pro. The very same ones that it released back in 2006. And since the Mac Pro 2018 will be modular, that means end users will be able to upgrade the machine with ease. 2006 Mac Pro (via memoryamerica.com) Most professionals who uses the Mac Pro require more graphics processing power in addition to CPU cores. As most of them are artists and digital content creators, they require more raw power when it comes to video editing and transcoding. Since most of the time, these are what they will be doing on the machine. While the current generation Mac Pro is beefy enough, obviously, it still falls short on major performance requirements. Main hardware components Unlike the older Mac Pro, the current workstation hardware offering from Apple is limited to only one processor. Back in 2006, Apple made it possible to add a second processor on Mac Pros for that added performance. With modularity in mind for the Mac Pro 2018, upgradability will also come easy. Unfortunately, nobody knows the extent of modularity Apple is planning on the upcoming Mac Pro. Hopefully, the Cupertino company will be kind enough to include another socket for an Intel Xeon processor. Intel Xeon Processor (via anandtech.com) At the moment, the current Mac Pro model only offers a single socket for the main processor. While it can be configured to a maximum of 12 cores, having the ability to add another processor into the build is somewhat more attractive to a PC enthusiast. This will give them a modicum of control on what they want their systems to be and how they perform. Furthermore, being able to add an extra processor will definitely boost the performance of the Mac Pro 2018. Graphics Since the Mac Pro 2018 will be modular, it could happen that users will not be limited as to what brand or type of graphics card they can use on the machine. Furthermore, as with many high-end PC setups, the chance to install more than one GPU on a single computer is a very exciting idea especially for gaming enthusiasts. Hopefully, Apple will also consider graphics card upgradability in the design of the Mac Pro 2018. This will come in handy especially now that NVIDIA just released the Mac drivers for the latest Pascal-based graphics cards like the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti and Titan Xp. Mac Pro 2018 pricing and release date The Mac Pro is known to be pricey and this is the main gripe of non-Apple users and perhaps the main deterrent for them as well. However, what everyone is paying on the Mac Pro is the solid build as well as the seamlessness of the hardware and software. This is why, it will not be a surprise at all if the entry-level Mac Pro 2018 is priced above $2,500. In fact, there is a very strong chance that Apple will retain the original base price at $2,999. 2013 Mac Pro (via apple.com) As for the release, if we are lucky enough, consumers could be seeing the new Mac Pro sometime in October next year. There is also a chance that it will happen earlier than that. Nevertheless, for now, all that can be done is wait. For more updates on the Mac Pro 2018, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Samsung SmartThings As any IoT devotee will attest, having the latest tech is one thing, but connecting it all together is another thing entirely. Samsung’s SmartThings hub does just that. By monitoring and controlling your household devices at the tap of its smartphone app, your television, electricity, heating and home security become connected, allowing you to stay in touch with your home remotely. A welcome assistant, whether you’re keeping check from another room or monitoring from another country. 4. Under Armour SpeedForm Gemini 2 RE The days of lugging a smartphone around on a run are almost over. While other fitness brands flock to dominate the market with tiny running wearables, Under Armour, wants you to start “untethered running” instead. How? By using a chip embedded in the sole of its SpeedForm Gemini running shoes. The company claims its battery will outlast the shoes, so charging or replacing will never be an issue. Distance is calculated by the chip, which then uploads your run data – including distance, time and split pace – via Bluetooth to the MapMyRun app. Tile 5. Tile Tile is a Bluetooth tracker that promises to solve one of humankind’s biggest annoyances: lost keys. By attaching, hooking or sticking a Tile to items like your wallet, keys or television remote, you can “ring” the tile from your smartphone. Handy when you’re in a tight spot and discreet when you’re not. 6. Opn hearing aids With Opn, Oticon released the world’s first smart hearing aid that can link into IoT devices such as doorbells, TVs, lights and smoke detectors to help keep the user safe. Similarly, by connecting through If This, Then That (IFTTT) technology, it can connect to any nearby smart device using the Oticon ON app. It uses BrainHearing technology to recognise softer speech and removes feedback in noisy environments, bringing a new way of connecting the hard of hearing. From helping us hit our personal bests on the track to securing our homes and pushing the boundaries of modern medicine, these devices show just the beginning of the IoT’s potential. TAG Heuer’s CM45 lets you take that connectivity with you everywhere you go – with a personal approach to connectivity and style.

In a new blog post, Microsoft's Bill Karagounis has outlined the tech giant's latest attempt at improving power efficiency with what it calls "Power Throttling." Currently in testing on the latest Windows Insider preview build (16176), Power Throttling essentially works to extend your battery by more intelligently managing multitasking. How does it work? To give great performance to the apps you're using, while at the same time power throttling background work, we built a sophisticated detection system into Windows. The OS identifies work that is important to you (apps in the foreground, apps playing music, as well as other categories of important work we infer from the demands of running apps and the apps the user interacts with). Karagounis notes that it has already experimented with Power Throttling a bit, and it prove pretty effective with up to 11 percent savings in CPU power consumption for "some of the most strenuous use cases." Currently, the feature only works with processors that support Intel's Speed Shift technology, which is only currentlyy present on Intel's 6th-generation Skylake and 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors. That said, Microsoft says it is working to extend support to other processors in the future. If you're on the latest Insider build, you might already be noticing a slight boost in battery life thanks to Power Throttling. And while Power Throttling should work with most apps, you can leave feedback about any apps that are negatively affected in the Feedback Hub under Power and Battery > Throttled Applications. Power Throttling can also be controlled system-wide by adjusting the Power Slider between "Battery Saver," "Recommended," and "Best Performance." Alternatively, Microsoft says you can opt apps out of Power Throttling on a per-app basis with the following steps: Go to Battery Settings (Settings > System > Battery). Click on "Battery Usage by App". Select your app. Toggle "Managed by Windows" to "Off". Uncheck the "Reduce work app does when in background" checkbox.

I can't say for sure that it's better, but doesn't seem any worse, and I think it's a little bit better. 0 2 days ago Reply Awhispersecho It's funny, I have had the Throttling feature on my Intel and Nvidia Chips for years now. Once again MS is late to the game. :) What I'm wondering is if I choose to enable throttling in Windows on top of my built in Intel and Nvidia throttling and enable throttling on throttling crime, will it cancel out my throttling? -2 3 days ago Reply GraniteStateColin CPU and GPU throttling is totally different. This is about the OS getting better and smarter at recognizing which tasks are just running in the background and forcing them to rest and use less battery without affecting the foreground application you're running or even background apps that may need full power. The throttling you are referring to slows down the entire system, including the foreground apps. 0 2 days ago Reply EJ6612 The slider for the battery doesn't show up on my Surface... 0 3 days ago Reply Mani Malekizadeh Amazing features   0 3 days ago Reply Kadcidxa Finally some tablet features.  1 3 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes A lot of commenters are missing the point here. If 15-30 minutes of extra battery life enable you to get that one last thing done at work, isn't it worth it? This isn't supposed to be a game changer, things like solid state lithium batteries are going to do that, this is one of many worthwhile improvements being added to Windows to increase productivity and keep it competitive in a mobile-centric world. Like many other improvements, if you don't like it or need it, don't whine about it, just turn the dang thing off. Some if us actually like these features. 7 3 days ago Reply GraniteStateColin Well said. And while it's not my personal priority in life, there are a lot of people around the world who seem quite focused on being green and reducing their carbon footprint. Anything that reduces power usage contributes to that. For me, longer battery life just means more productivity. Either way, this is a pure win. These effects tend to be cumulative anyway. 10% here, 10% there, eventually that 4 hour laptop life is 8 hours, then 12. This is news about one of those incremental improvements. 0 2 days ago Reply he_shark Yeah, it's great news for users and the planet. I think people here are just so worn down with all the negative Windows Phone news over the last couple of years they can no longer be happy when they hear some positive MS news and are trying to find negatives. I don't know if Microsoft can ever recover the reputation, that killed WP, and it's going to kill Windows and everything else if they cannot do something about it. Personally I think they've mostly been doing great work lately, but the world on average just seems to love Google & Apple and hate on MS. 0 2 days ago Reply SaschaDr Really, who cares? Just add bigger batteries. 11 % of CPU power consumption is abysmal, the power these days is consumed mostly by the display. Add a fancy OLED screen to a Surface Pro and there you have your power savings. -7 3 days ago Reply F3rzz and make it one mm thicker -4 3 days ago Reply he_shark Everyone who uses their laptop should care about this, even a 1% improvement can make the difference between finishing what you're doing or not (and being kinder to the planet). 11% is massive, coupled with other improvements in Windows 10 it could give people an extra couple of hours over an otherwise identical Windows 7/8 machine. I don't see how people are managing to spin this as a negative, it's one of the best bits of news I've heard from MS lately. 0 2 days ago Reply F3rzz So basically everything Works worse in order to extend battery life... no thanks. -20 3 days ago Reply F3rzz This is probably for Windows on ARWhatever and is being extended for Intel... hmmm.... is this the future of Windows mobile. lol i'm out. -16 3 days ago Reply Axmantim Did you read the part where you can turn it off? 12 3 days ago Reply F3rzz how does that change what i said? no thanks = i'll turn it off, but since it's a per app toggle, it is very inconvenient. -15 3 days ago Reply Axmantim It's not like you'd need to turn it off for every app. If power is your gripe, you would only "need" to turn it off for demanding apps. You're just creating an issue where one doesn't exist. 9 3 days ago Reply F3rzz ok -4 3 days ago Reply Charles Fecht The lack of common sense here is Mind boggling. It's not "Working worse" to extend battery. It stops background stuff that you aren't using from using up a lot of battery. And this is NOT for Windows mobile. This is for PC, which you could EASILY tell just realizing something as simple as there is a picture of the task manger in the article. 4 3 days ago Reply F3rzz i meant this is ongoing development to create a full PC in a Smartphone formfactor,,, the mythical Surface phone. 0 3 days ago Reply Mister Burns And that is what you find bad about this news? 0 2 days ago Reply bleached That was my first thought as well but this will only be an issue when on battery power. Shouldn't be an issue during those times. Hopefully it is easily disabled when not needed. 0 3 days ago Reply DragonPoo Nah, that's oversimplified too much.  "Basically, everything you aren't using works worse," but the things you are using works better.  It's how multitasking on mobile platforms like iOS works, and how Android should work (if it wasn't such a resource hog). How many tabs do you actively use in your browser at one time?  Do you really need the image shifting to occur on a tab you haven't looked at for three hours?  If Microsoft could find a way to squeeze 11% of extra performance out of my system, with no noticable issues to me, I am all for it. 8 3 days ago Reply F3rzz A couple years ago iOS like multitasking was dreaded in this site comment section, everybody wanted "true multitasking". With that aside, the example you are giving is overly specific, but it actually is very close to my heart, since i have wanted to have such a feature forever. I manage to make a mess of up to 3 hundred tabs every single time Lol. In chrome i use two extensions, one that deactivate unused tabs after a user mandated amount of time, and also "onetab" which acts like the new "set tabs aside" feature of edge, which i can finally say is ahead of competition (at least in that aspect). But do i want that to happen if i'm using several adobe applications at the same time? do i really need extra waiting time when i switch between them only to save "up to 11% battery in the most strenuous use case"? i think not. I'm not even speculating, they themselves are saying "up to 11%", sometimes it saves less. So now i am speculating: i think most of the times it will save a dissmisable amount of energy. -3 3 days ago Reply Charles Fecht 11% is an extra hour and a half on a 12 hour battery. 2 3 days ago Reply F3rzz where are they? they are lies! -1 3 days ago Reply DragonPoo I thought something similar; my laptop at work is connected to three external monitors, plus its own screen, so I can actually be working on multiple applications at the same time.  However, it is also docked to a power source, so battery performance isn't an issue. For this to be useful, we're only talking about devices with a single screen, running on a battery.  Although it's possible to be working in multiple applications simultaneously, it isn't as common.  And I'm expecting this power throttling experience to understand what is being used, and what isn't, and adjust accordingly.  (Actually, UWP/Store apps already do this - they are suspended whilst in the background, to reduce drain on system performance) 0 2 days ago Reply Ma Rio It's all great, but the core problem stands. The battery technology is old and needs to be renewed. I respect Microsoft's and other parties attempts at fixing it, but that's not their battle. They can only do so much, and also at the cost of limiting something else. At least for me throttling has a negative connotation. So until there's a breaktrough in batteries, we're not gonna see any major difference. 5 3 days ago Reply Scabrat Well, if ARM chips are getting more power then we might see a little spike in battery life. But you are right. We need better battery tech.  0 3 days ago Reply DragonPoo I agree that battery technology is old, and hope for some breakthroughs on it.  I can't see that happening to systems we can buy within the next year or two, though. I can also see the term "throttling" as a negative one, but am trying to look at this in a positive way: rather like a car that offers multiple gears.  If you can downshift a car to get more performance out of it when needed, or have it go into "ECO" mode to just glide along when you don't need the extra work, I can see this as postive.  I've seen Intel release chips that offer Base and Turbo frequencies.  You don't always run in Turbo, but typically in Base.  When you need the boost, it goes up to Turbo speed.  I see this as a reverse, where you might not need the Base performance, but could get away with less. 3 3 days ago Reply ErikasS Nice and good things are coming.

Vive is looking to ease that burden and has some zero-commission, no-interest financing options, for graphics cards and PCs alike. Back in February Vive announced its financing program to help potential customers acquire virtual reality headsets at a more affordable monthly price. Now, the program has been expanded with three additional options, making it easier and more affordable than ever to get a hold of VR tech in North America. The first offer is designed for those who already have a high-end PC, but lack a powerful graphics card to drive the virtual reality immersion. For these users Vive is offering its VR headset bundled with an Nvidia GTX 1070 Founder’s Edition card, all for $999. That’s about $200 off the sticker price for both devices, but with financing, users can get this bundle for just $49 per month, with a 24-month contract. Luckily, you don’t need a down payment and there’s no interest on the credit line. The second bundle on offer includes a Vive VR headset and a MSI VR ready laptop, which the company touts as one of their “go to machines” when demoing VR on the road. This will cost users about $125 a month, shipping and tax estimated. The laptop included in this bundle, the MSI GS73VR, has some very impressive specs and should serve users as much more than a simple gaming rig. These are its specs: Display: 17.3″ Full HD Non-Reflection 1920×1080 Operating System: Windows 10 Home Processor: Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad Core Processor (2.6-3.5 GHz) Graphics Card: NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB GDDR5 RAM: 16 GB (8 GB x2) DDR4 2400 MHz | Hard Drive: 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD + 1 TB (5400 rpm) Special features: 120 Hz 5 ms Display | VR READY | Steel Series Full-Color Backlight Keyboard w/ Anti-Ghost Key + Silver Lining | Killer Gaming Network E2400 | Thunderbolt 3 | Slim and Light Design | Metal Build Finally, Vive is also offering a financing option for a desktop bundle, including a VR headset and the so-called Cyberpower GXi970 system. This bundle, which falls closer to the medium-range when it comes to desktop gaming, comes in at “less than $99 per month”. These are the desktop’s specs: System: Intel i5-7600 3.5 GHz Quad-Core | Intel B250 Chipset | 8 GB DDR4 | 2 TB HDD | 24X DVD±RW Dual-Layer Super-Multi Drive Operating System: Windows 10 Home Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB Video Card | 1x DVI | 1x HDMI | 1x DisplayPort Connectivity: 6x USB 3.0 | 4x USB 2.0 Ports | 1x RJ-45 Network Ethernet 10/100/1000 | Audio: 7.1 Channel | Keyboard and Mouse Special Feature: RGB 7-Color Gaming Keyboard Warranty: 1-Year Parts & Labor Warranty | Free Lifetime Tech Support Buyers will also be getting one month free of Vive’s Viveport Subscription as well as a number of bundled VR titles. All in all some of these deals may be quite attractive for potential customers, especially if they’re looking to spread out the high cost of a VR system over the long run. Here’s hoping deals like these make it to other parts of the world as well.

newsletters F8: Connectivity, artificial intelligence and more from day two 21 Apr 2017 | Save | Email | Print |  PDF     Day two of F8 2017, saw chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer, director of connectivity programs, Yael Maguire; director of applied machine learning, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela; chief scientist of Oculus research, Michael Abrash; and VP of engineering and building 8 Regina Dugan present their keynote thoughts. Director of connectivity programs, Yael Maguire at F8 eventThe annual Facebook event where developers and businesses come together to explore the future of technology, drew a major online audience. In the opening keynote, Schroepfer talked about the company’s goal to develop technology that will help everyone build global community. To do that, it is investing in three foundational technologies over the next 10 years: connectivity, artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Connectivity Rather than look for a one-size-fits-all connectivity solution, Facebook is investing in a building-block strategy — designing different technologies for specific use cases, which are then used together to create flexible and extensible networks. Today it highlighted new milestones in its efforts to reach people who are unconnected and increase capacity and performance for everyone else. The team set three new records in wireless data transfer: 36 gigabits per second over 13 kilometres point-to-point using millimetre-wave (MMW) technology; 80 gigabits per second between those same points using optical cross-link technology; and 16 gigabits per second from a location on the ground to a circling Cessna aircraft over 7 km away using MMW. Additionally, its Terragraph system being tested with San Jose in the city’s downtown corridor has become the first city-scale mesh millimetre-wave system capable of delivering fibre-like multi-gigabits/s of performance and reliability. It also announced Tether-tenna, a new kind of “insta-infrastructure” where a small helicopter tethered to a wire containing fibre and power can be deployed immediately to bring back connectivity in case of emergency. Artificial Intelligence AI is a powerful tool, and Facebook is leveraging it to build amazing visual experiences for people. AI has revolutionised the ability of computers to process and understand images and videos. It is easy to forget that only five years ago, computers saw images as just a collection of numbers, with no particular meaning to them. Now computers can understand every single individual pixel of an image. These advancements enable new experiences. For example, Facebook is working on using AI to help people discover the videos they care for the most. The company believes AI belongs to everyone. That's why today it announced that it is open sourcing Caffe2 — a framework to build and run AI algorithms on a phone — and building partnerships with Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and others. Another way it is giving this technology back is through an AI-infused camera across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. With the ability to run cutting edge AI and computer vision algorithms on the device, this camera can now understand users’ surroundings, recognise people, places and things. It can annotate and enhance images and video. The new Camera Effects Platform gives developers a way to build new tools for creative expression, and we shared a few demos of ideas that have come out of our research. Virtual Reality Facebook is investing in VR across mobile and PC hardware, software and content — from Oculus Rift and Gear VR to Facebook Spaces. At the conference, it introduced the newest designs for the Surround 360 camera that allows people to produce amazing high quality videos for VR. It creates some of the most immersive and engaging content ever shot for VR. The new camera technology lets users move around within the video scene and experience the content from different viewing angles. This means users can move their head around in the world and see it from different angles, bringing the feeling of immersion and depth to a whole new level. Augmented Reality On day one of F8, Mark Zuckerberg talked about how the camera is the first augmented reality platform. On day two, Abrash shared a vision for the path to full AR — where augmentation enhances users’ vision and hearing seamlessly, while being light, comfortable, power-efficient and socially acceptable enough to accompany them everywhere. He talked about the rise of virtual computing — which encompasses both virtual and augmented reality — as the next great wave after personal computing. Virtual computing is just starting to form, but it will give users the ability to transcend time and space to connect with one another in new ways. In order to make virtual computing as much a part of everyday life as the smartphone is today, the company is going to need see-through augmented reality, which will likely be transparent glasses that can show virtual images overlaid on the real world. The set of technologies needed to reach full AR does not exist yet. This is a decade-long investment and it will require major advances in material science, perception, graphics and many other areas. However, once that is achieved, AR has the potential to enhance almost every aspect of users’ lives, revolutionising how we work, play and interact. Building 8 Building 8 is the product development and research team at Facebook, focused on creating and shipping new, category-defining consumer products that are social first, and that advance Facebook’s mission. A breakthrough innovation engine modelled after Darpa and shipped at scale will power products from Building 8. At F8, Facebook announced two technical projects aimed at the development of new, breakthrough communications platforms. It is working on a system that will let people type with their brains. Specifically, it has a goal of creating a silent speech system capable of typing 100 words per minute straight from the user’s brain – that is five times faster than one can type on a smartphone today. This is not about decoding random thoughts. Think of it like this: You take many photos and choose to share only some of them. Similarly, you have many thoughts and choose to share only some of them. This is about decoding those words one has already decided to share by sending them to the speech centre of one’s brain. It is a way to communicate with the speed and flexibility of one’s voice and the privacy of text. Facebook wants to do this with non-invasive, wearable sensors that can be manufactured at scale. It also has a project directed at allowing people to hear with their skin. It is building the hardware and software necessary to deliver language through the skin. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

Arbor’s EmQ-i2401, which runs Ubuntu or Windows 10 on Intel’s latest “Apollo Lake” SoCs, follows its Intel “Bay Trail” based EmQ-i2301 Qseven module. It competes with other Qseven 2.x compliant Apollo Lake modules such as the Portwell PQ7-M108 , Advantech SOM-3569, Congatec Conga-QA5, and Seco Q7-B03. EmQ-i2401 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) Unlike these competitors, Arbor’s 70 x 70mm Qseven entry does not support the three Apollo Lake Atom models, but only the quad-core, 1.1GHz/2.5GHz Pentium N4200 and the dual-core, 1.1GHz/2.4GHz Celeron N3350. Both models have low 6W TDPs, or 4W based on Intel’s SDP calculation. Power consumption on the Pentium model typically runs at [email protected] , says Arbor. Like the Seco model, the EmQ-i2401 lacks DDR4 support. Both the CPU and the 4GB to 8GB of DDR3L RAM is soldered for greater reliability. The Pentium model ships standard with 32GB of eMMC 5.0 storage, although either model supports up to 32GB or 64GB eMMC via OEM request, depending on whether you believe the spec sheet or press release. The EmQ-i2401 is equipped with an Intel i210 GbE controller, and provides 2x 6Gbps SATA, 4x PCIe x1, 2x USB 3.0, and 4x USB 2.0 interfaces. A DDI port supports HDMI or DisplayPorts at up to 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels). A dual-channel, 24-bit LVDS interface supports up to 1920 x 1200, and can be reconfigured as dual eDP channels. Additional I/O includes UART, I2C, LPC, SDIO, and HD audio. Intel AES-NI encryption support is also available. The temperature range is -20 to 85°C for the Celeron and -20 to 70°C for the Pentium. A heat spreader is optional, along with a cable kit.   PBQ-900L carrier board The EmQ-i2401 module is available with a new PBQ-900L carrier board that appears to support all six of Arbor’s Qseven modules. The 165 x 115mm, EPIC form factor board supports -40 to 85ºC temperatures and has a wide-range 19-30V DC input. PBQ-900L carrier (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Qseven 2.0 compliant PBQ-900 carrier provides dual GbE ports, an SD slot, a SATA connector, and an “NGFF (M.2) socket for Skt1-M to support SATA depending on SSD module,” says Arbor. The board is further equipped with a DVI port and LVDS connector, 2x USB 3.0 ports, and a USB 2.0 port. PBQ-900L coastline ports (click image to enlarge) There are 4x COM ports, one of which supports RS-232/422/485 signals, as well as a UART interface. Other interfaces include SMBus, I2C, 8-bit DIO, audio mic/line out, and Super I/O.   Further information The EmQ-i2401 Qseven module will be available in May. More information may be found on Arbor’s EmQ-i2401 and PBQ-900L carrier product pages.   Related posts: Qseven COM offers Apollo Lake and a security chip Rugged Qseven module runs Linux on Apollo Lake Three more Apollo Lake COMs support Qseven and COM Express Mini Apollo Lake module takes the heat — and the cold Aaeon shows its first Apollo Lake COM Tiny COM features Apollo Lake and soldered RAM SODIMM-style module runs Linux on Apollo Lake Adlink bakes Apollo Lake into four modules and a Mini-ITX… Tiny μQseven module aims Bay Trail Atoms at IoT Thin 3.5-inch SBC features Apollo Lake chips, dual GbE, dual (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

The mysterious firm, Groq, has remained elusive on its work, but it appears to be working on a rival TPU chip. Scroll down for video  Several Google engineers have left the firm to join a secretive AI startup. The mysterious startup, Groq, has remained very elusive on its work, but it appears to be working on a rival TPU chip WHAT IS GROQ WORKING ON? Chamath Palihapitiya invested in the team of ex-Googlers last year, and he now hopes to build a 'next-generation chip,' taking on some of the world's biggest firms, including Intel and Google. Groq hopes that this revolutionary chip 'can empower companies like Facebook and Amazon, Tesla, the government to do things with machine learning and computers that nobody could do before,' according to Mr Palihapitiya. The key to creating the chip is to squeeze heavy and highly sophisticated computation into less silicon – something which Google's TPU is one step ahead of its competition with. Groq was started by Chamath Palihapitiya, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent venture investors. So far, there is no website or promotional materials, but filings from last year show that the firm has already raised $10.3 million (£8 million). Speaking to CNBC, Mr Palihapitiya said: 'We're really excited about Groq. 'It's too early to talk specifics, but we think what they're building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing.' In its filing, Groq names three principals – Jonathan Ross, inventor of the TPU, Douglas Wightman, a former Google engineer, and Mr Palihapitiya himself. Mr Palihapitiya invested in the team of ex-Googlers last year, and he now hopes to build a 'next-generation chip,' taking on some of the world's biggest firms, including Intel and Qualcomm.

The key to creating the chip is to squeeze heavy and highly sophisticated computation into less silicon – something which Google's TPU (pictured) is one step ahead of its competition with WHAT IS A TPU?  Tensor processing units (TPUs) are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) developed specifically for machine learning. TPUs are designed for a higher volume of reduced precision computation than other types of processing units. The chip was specifically designed for Google's TensorFlow framework, but Google still uses other chips for different types of machine learning. Mr Palihapitiya said at a conference last year that 'they're an order of magnitude ahead' of everyone else. Earlier this month, Google revealed the progress of its TPU work. In a blog post, Norm Jouppi, a Google engineer, wrote that AI workloads using TPUs were running 15 to 30 times faster than contemporary processors, while efficiency was 30 to 80 times better. Mr Ross was one of the 75 authors on the report, and he is also listed in the paper as an inventor on four patents. MailOnline has contacted Google for comment.

The entire tech world is highly enthusiastic about Microsoft and Apple’s upcoming hybrid devices. Microsoft is expected to introduce Surface Pro 5 while rumor has it that Apple is already adding the finishing touches to iPad Pro 2. Both devices fit in the same hybrid category which means that they are tablets which are more than capable of replacing a laptop at any given day. Surface Pro 5 Considering the fact that Surface Pro 4 was the device which helped Microsoft reached one billion in profits last year, it’s safe to say that Surface Pro 5 is already on the way. According to rumors and speculations, Microsoft is going to equip Surface Pro 5 with the best hardware parts that are available on the market such as Intel’s latest Kaby Lake architecture. In addition, Microsoft’s highly anticipated hybrid device is also said to feature a 4K display. If this proves to be true it will give Surface Pro 5 a huge advance over its competition since it will be able to display impressive viewing experiences. Last but not least, Surface Pro 5 will surely be equipped with an USB Type-C port. iPad Pro 2 Just like Microsoft, Apple is expected to equip iPad Pro 2 only with impressive hardware specs. The difference is that Apple enjoys taking matters into its own hands when it comes to hardware power and that’s why iPad Pro 2 will be powered by Apple’s latest A10X processor. What’s interesting is that Apple is rumored to introduce three size models of iPad Pro 2 instead of the traditional two. With that being said, iPad Pro 2 will be available in the 9.7 inch, 10.5 inch and 12.9 inch size variants. In order to stay up on par with Surface Pro 5, iPad Pro will surely also feature a 4K display. However, Apple will definitely decide to use TrueTone technology which will make reading experiences so much more immersive than they already are. The reason we are saying this is because TrueTone calibrates the display’s brightness in order to fit the user’s surroundings.

A budget laptop is one that you pick up when you don’t have an option, and when it comes to high-end devices, you usually know what you want. The mid-range segment, however, is where you go when you need a laptop and you’re willing to spend a little to get one that will last. You’re looking for a workhorse. The Acer TravelMate P449 is one such device, and at Rs 44,000 and decidedly mid-range specs, it fits this definition perfectly. So, is the P449 a workhorse that you would want? Build and Design: 8/10 I like the look and feel of the P449. It feels entirely plastic, but of good quality. The angular design is understated and almost elegant. It blends in well with a crowd of laptops, but it’ll also stand apart on closer inspection, and I like that. It’s something I wouldn’t mind carrying around with me. There are no shiny strips, erratic patterns or ridiculous colour schemes. Even the Acer logo isn’t very prominent. It’s placed on the top right corner of the lid and makes its presence felt without being too obvious. Everything feels sturdy and solid and the hinge opens easily. There’s little wobble once it’s open, however, which is good. If you put a little effort into it, the screen can flex rather alarmingly, but in general use, this won’t happen. Overall, I like the look and feel of the device. Keyboard and Trackpad: 8/10 The keyboard and trackpad are functional and comfortable to use. The key travel is good and the keyboard is backlit, making for a pleasant typing experience. I never missed a keystroke while typing. The touchpad is also responsive and large enough for the device. Features: 6/10 While the specifications of the device are good, I am a bit disappointed by some of the choices that were made with the device. The processing power is provided by an Intel i5 6200U CPU and 8 GB of RAM. This is a sensible compromise between power and battery life. However, Acer’s decision to use a hard disk instead of an SSD was a little disappointing. In my experience, an SSD does a lot more to make a system feel fast and zippy than any other component in a PC. There’s nothing wrong with the included 500 GB HDD of course, but I feel a 128 GB SSD would have been a better option, especially for a work device. These are all USB 2.0 ports. What a waste. On the connectivity front, you get everything you could ask for. This includes USB-C, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, an SD card reader, an Ethernet port, HDMI, a VGA port and even a smart card reader. However, while Acer put four regular USB ports on the device, only one of those is USB 3.0. Another misstep is the screen. The 1366×768 resolution is tolerable, but as you’ll see below, its quality is suspect. Oh, and you get a fingerprint sensor. Display: 5/10 You can ignore the low resolution, but the poor colour rendition and viewing angles can’t be ignored A laptop’s screen is vital to your computing experience, especially on a workhorse. You’re going to be staring at it the whole day and a pleasant screen makes for a relatively pleasant typing experience. Two things are needed for this: A high resolution and good colour handling. The P449 fails on both counts. The resolution of 1366 x 768 is very low on a 14-inch screen. It roughly translates to a PPI of just a little over 100, which is abysmal. I would really have loved to see a Full HD screen or, at the very least, a 1600 x 900 one. It’s possible to overlook the screen resolution, but I can’t overlook the terrible quality of the display. Black levels and white levels are among the worst we’ve seen, and this includes the Rs 9,999 iBall Compbook Excellance and the Smartron t.Book. Worse than this are the viewing angles. If you look at the display from any angle other than head-on, the screen will look washed out and the colours will turn negative. This is noticeable even if you tilt the screen slightly higher or lower than the optimum viewing angle. Speaking of tilting, the one aspect of the screen that’s really good is its hinge, which lets the screen tilt by 180 degrees. Performance: 6/10 Performance was average and within the expected range for a device in this configuration. There is nothing that stands out. You can enjoy light gaming (GRID, CS: GO) and you won’t notice any dips performance when you open two dozen tabs in Chrome or do some image editing. There is some slight lag when opening apps and Windows does take a little longer to start up than I’m used to, but that’s to be expected with an HDD. Temperatures were always under control and the device never got uncomfortably hot. Don’t’ get me wrong, this yawn-inducing performance is actually a good sign. The laptop is simply performing as expected. Speakers are alright. They’re sufficiently loud for listening in a moderately quiet room and they do their job. Again, nothing spectacular, just functional. Battery Life: 6.5/10 The low-resolution screen paired with a sensible processor means that the battery life is quite good. Our standard battery test pegged this laptop’s battery life at 3 hours 53 minutes. In real world usage, the laptop happily got me through most of a work day (about 5-6 hours), which includes tonnes of email, web browsing (with upwards of 30 tabs open at any given time), typing in Word and light image editing. Verdict and Price in India At Rs 44,000, the laptop is a decent buy. If it wasn’t for the screen, I’d blindly recommend this to anyone who asks for a laptop in this price range. I really liked this laptop. It’s a very sensible configuration with an understated design, which is something that’s actually a little hard to come by in this price range. One can easily overlook the lack of an SSD or the single USB 3.0 port, but the screen is the deal-breaker. This is a laptop that someone will expect to use for at least a couple of years, if not more. I’d rather not spend that time staring at a screen as bad as this one.

A budget laptop is one that you pick up when you don’t have an option, and when it comes to high-end devices, you usually know what you want. The mid-range segment, however, is where you go when you need a laptop and you’re willing to spend a little to get one that will last. You’re looking for a workhorse. The Acer TravelMate P449 is one such device, and at Rs 44,000 and decidedly mid-range specs, it fits this definition perfectly. So, is the P449 a workhorse that you would want? Build and Design: 8/10 I like the look and feel of the P449. It feels entirely plastic, but of good quality. The angular design is understated and almost elegant. It blends in well with a crowd of laptops, but it’ll also stand apart on closer inspection, and I like that. It’s something I wouldn’t mind carrying around with me. There are no shiny strips, erratic patterns or ridiculous colour schemes. Even the Acer logo isn’t very prominent. It’s placed on the top right corner of the lid and makes its presence felt without being too obvious. Everything feels sturdy and solid and the hinge opens easily. There’s little wobble once it’s open, however, which is good. If you put a little effort into it, the screen can flex rather alarmingly, but in general use, this won’t happen. Overall, I like the look and feel of the device. Keyboard and Trackpad: 8/10 The keyboard and trackpad are functional and comfortable to use. The key travel is good and the keyboard is backlit, making for a pleasant typing experience. I never missed a keystroke while typing. The touchpad is also responsive and large enough for the device. Features: 6/10 While the specifications of the device are good, I am a bit disappointed by some of the choices that were made with the device. The processing power is provided by an Intel i5 6200U CPU and 8 GB of RAM. This is a sensible compromise between power and battery life. However, Acer’s decision to use a hard disk instead of an SSD was a little disappointing. In my experience, an SSD does a lot more to make a system feel fast and zippy than any other component in a PC. There’s nothing wrong with the included 500 GB HDD of course, but I feel a 128 GB SSD would have been a better option, especially for a work device. These are all USB 2.0 ports. What a waste. On the connectivity front, you get everything you could ask for. This includes USB-C, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, an SD card reader, an Ethernet port, HDMI, a VGA port and even a smart card reader. However, while Acer put four regular USB ports on the device, only one of those is USB 3.0. Another misstep is the screen. The 1366×768 resolution is tolerable, but as you’ll see below, its quality is suspect. Oh, and you get a fingerprint sensor. Display: 5/10 You can ignore the low resolution, but the poor colour rendition and viewing angles can’t be ignored A laptop’s screen is vital to your computing experience, especially on a workhorse. You’re going to be staring at it the whole day and a pleasant screen makes for a relatively pleasant typing experience. Two things are needed for this: A high resolution and good colour handling. The P449 fails on both counts. The resolution of 1366 x 768 is very low on a 14-inch screen. It roughly translates to a PPI of just a little over 100, which is abysmal. I would really have loved to see a Full HD screen or, at the very least, a 1600 x 900 one. It’s possible to overlook the screen resolution, but I can’t overlook the terrible quality of the display. Black levels and white levels are among the worst we’ve seen, and this includes the Rs 9,999 iBall Compbook Excellance and the Smartron t.Book. Worse than this are the viewing angles. If you look at the display from any angle other than head-on, the screen will look washed out and the colours will turn negative. This is noticeable even if you tilt the screen slightly higher or lower than the optimum viewing angle. Speaking of tilting, the one aspect of the screen that’s really good is its hinge, which lets the screen tilt by 180 degrees. Performance: 6/10 Performance was average and within the expected range for a device in this configuration. There is nothing that stands out. You can enjoy light gaming (GRID, CS: GO) and you won’t notice any dips performance when you open two dozen tabs in Chrome or do some image editing. There is some slight lag when opening apps and Windows does take a little longer to start up than I’m used to, but that’s to be expected with an HDD. Temperatures were always under control and the device never got uncomfortably hot. Don’t’ get me wrong, this yawn-inducing performance is actually a good sign. The laptop is simply performing as expected. Speakers are alright. They’re sufficiently loud for listening in a moderately quiet room and they do their job. Again, nothing spectacular, just functional. Battery Life: 6.5/10 The low-resolution screen paired with a sensible processor means that the battery life is quite good. Our standard battery test pegged this laptop’s battery life at 3 hours 53 minutes. In real world usage, the laptop happily got me through most of a work day (about 5-6 hours), which includes tonnes of email, web browsing (with upwards of 30 tabs open at any given time), typing in Word and light image editing. Verdict and Price in India At Rs 44,000, the laptop is a decent buy. If it wasn’t for the screen, I’d blindly recommend this to anyone who asks for a laptop in this price range. I really liked this laptop. It’s a very sensible configuration with an understated design, which is something that’s actually a little hard to come by in this price range. One can easily overlook the lack of an SSD or the single USB 3.0 port, but the screen is the deal-breaker. This is a laptop that someone will expect to use for at least a couple of years, if not more. I’d rather not spend that time staring at a screen as bad as this one.

Pretax profit jumped 27 percent to 3.01 billion euros (R43 billion) in the first quarter, more than expected even taking into account one-off gains that included 183million from revaluing Here after Intel invested in it. Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler last week posted an 87 percent jump in quarterly operating profit, while Volkswagen on Tuesday reported a 28 percent rise, helped by a return to earnings growth at its core VW brand. Share this story Workers clean a BMW 740Le. Pre-tax profit jumped e3.01 billion. Photo: Reuters “The European market, China and some emerging markets are developing much better than expected. Only the US market is tougher,” said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, explaining the strong results from German car makers. He rates BMW shares “in line”. German car association VDA expects global car sales to rise 2 percent this year, driven by China, where sales are seen rising by 6percent, while demand in the US and Western Europe is seen stable. Impressed But European car sales leapt 10.9 percent last month, led by buoyant demand in the region’s top five markets and extra-selling days due to a late Easter this year that saw the holiday fall into this month. Analysts were impressed by the extent to which BMW beat expectations, noting increased profits from Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive. “While this beat might seem moderate compared to the one seen at VW, it is actually slightly better than the one at Mercedes-Benz car division, despite a less favourable product cycle,” wrote Barclays analyst Kristina Church, who rates BMW “overweight/neutral”. BMW shares were little changed at 1.50pm.

Other valuation effects lifted BMW’s financial result by a further 122 million euros. Intel said in January it was buying a 15 percent stake in Here for an undisclosed sum, after Navinfo, Tencent and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in December. BMW affirmed its guidance for a slight rise in full-year group pretax profit and an operating margin of 8 to 10 percent at its automotive business, which posted a first-quarter margin of 9 percent, down from 9.4 percent a year earlier. Sales rose 12 percent in the quarter to 23.5 billion euros, above the average analyst forecast of 22.1 billion euros, Thomson Reuters estimates show. BMW is set to publish detailed first-quarter results on May 4.

Its annual developer conference here showed a rich mix of creative and sometimes crude work toward its many ambitious aims. Under the hood, Facebook and its cloud computing rivals are essentially global giant data farms where harvesting the good stuff depends on machine learning. Facebook’s engine is unique in part for how it aims to leverage both its global warehouses of servers, and its users’ smartphones. Facebook’s new Caffe 2 framework takes a page -- and a key developer -- from rival Google’s Tensorflow. Caffe 2 is a significantly upgraded version of the machine-learning framework originally created at UC Berkeley by Yangqing Jia. After graduating, he spent two years at Google working on Tensorflow and other projects before Facebook hired him in February 2016 as engineering lead for its AI platform. “We needed more flexibility, so we made [Caffe] more modular and friendly to different hardware back ends…mobile is a major interest,” said Jia in an interview with EE Times on the F8 show floor. Smartphones will use Caffe 2 models to recognize and enhance objects in photos, creating AR effects similar to Pokemon Go and Snapchat filters. The so-called “style transfers” mark Facebook’s first strategic steps to draw consumers into AR. On the show floor, Qualcomm showed neural-network software handling image recognition at 50 frames/second on the Adreno GPU cores in its high-end Snapdragon SoCs. That’s much faster than the 12 f/s the SoC’s Kryo CPU delivers as a default. This summer Qualcomm will release the software in a version that also uses its Hexagon DSP as an accelerator. Facebook is clearly betting on such capabilities being widely available in the future. For today it will have to deal with a widely fragmented handset market that lacks such support. Processor vendors will want to support all broadly used machine learning frameworks, but their efforts will take time. For example, ARM and Ceva, whose cores are widely used in smartphones, have so far expressed support for Tensorflow, not Caffe 2. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm were quick to say they will support Caffe 2. Facebook already uses Nvidia’s GPUs on it training servers. Jia suggested the door open is for Caffe 2 inference accelerators on its servers, similar to the TPUs Google started deploying in 2015. “We see [potential for] a lot of hardware optimizations…There are quite a few computation patterns stabilized enough for hardware to use, and more and more computation patents will stabilize,” he said. However, all the frameworks are still evolving to support a wider range of neural networks with higher performance. “It’s a healthy competition, in general we’re all searching for a better solution for A.I.—it’s like the evolution of programming languages,” he said. For its part, Facebook is replacing a mix of frameworks including Torch with Caffe 2. Facebook made the framework open source and will use it on all its machine learning jobs including computer vision and machine translation on servers. It also is working with rivals Amazon and Microsoft to make it easier for business users to tap into their AI services. “It’s about setting up development environments easily, similar to using pre-installed software,” Jia said. For its part, Google’s Tensorflow is being used by AirBnB, Dropbox, SAP, Twitter, Uber and Xiaomi. Overall, Facebook is behind its Web rivals in machine learning, according to Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research. “AI remains essential to Facebook’s long-term growth as it is sitting upon a mountain of data but still is not in a position to really make the most of the insights and automation that it can provide,” Windsor wrote in a research note that cited progress in image recognition where the company has made significant hires. Qualcomm showed gains running Caffe 2 on its Adreno GPU. (Image EE Times) “Facebook had to move beyond Torch, which they use internally for research, since Torch is based on the Lua language,” said Karl Freund, a senior analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Most AI programmers use and prefer Python, which is native for many other frameworks, including Caffe,” he said. “The largest cloud and Internet sites have developed and promoted their own AI frameworks to keep a competitive edge and develop a loyal ecosystem,” Freund said. “They cannot use someone else’s open source versions as these always lag the code used internally by as much as a year. Each company will have their specific area of focus, for example, Facebook focuses on imaging and Amazon focuses on natural language processing,” he added. Indeed, Facebook AI specialist Joaquin Candela showed how its Mask R-CNN algorithms can now tightly detect and classify people and objects—even when they are moving in video or have parts blocked by other objects. Candela claimed the enhancements in Caffe 2 provided 100x speedups in inference jobs run on smartphones. Its use in Facebook’s image and texting apps — Instagram and Messenger — “makes it the largest A.I. deployment ever,” he said in a keynote.

That’s after NVDA stock hit a high of more than $119 as recently as February. Source: Shutterstock In the original vision for cloud computing, a decade ago, it was an article of faith that the cloud was designed to harness cheap, low-power chips and combine their resources to get the most bang for a computing buck. The advent of artificial intelligence, and the need for clouds to support AI, is forcing a re-think. This is highlighted by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) — the artist formerly known as Google, the first company to bring the cloud to glory — designing its own machine learning chip, dubbed a Tensor Processing Unit. It is said to deliver a lot more price-performance than “competing” processors from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and, to our point, Nvidia. But those who are bearish on NVDA stock are missing an important point. Everybody Wins First, the new Google chip was compared against an old Nvidia chip, not its newest design. More importantly, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wrote in a recent blog post, this is a war where every advanced chip company is going to win. “Without accelerated computing,” he wrote, “the scale-out of AI is simply not practical.” Artificial intelligence, or deep learning, “is a new computing model that has required the invention of a new computing architecture.” The design models that Nvidia has been using for graphics are ideal for deep learning, and thus for delivering AI at scale. This was the point when Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) announced more than a year ago it would ally with NVDA on cloud AI for its “AliCloud.” Google may order production of a bunch of Tensor chips for its cloud processing centers, but do you think Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are going to be filing big orders for a direct cloud competitor’s processors? Not when there are alternatives around, and there are. As Mr. Huang noted, Nvidia has one. A Needless Kerfuffle Nvidia did $6.9 billion worth of business for the quarter ending in January, mainly for graphics processors used in game machines, and its last two quarters indicate fiscal 2018 sales will run well over $8 billion. The April quarter is notoriously weak because most new models come out in the fall for delivery at Christmas. Last year, NVDA had sales of $1.3 billion in the April quarter, from which $470 million, or 73 cents per share, flowed to net income.

Pai said on Thursday that his visits with executives at Facebook, Cisco, Oracle, and Intel were constructive and that he believed the companies wanted to find “common ground.” Advertisement Web companies have supported net neutrality, saying the protections guard them from paying tolls to get their content in front of consumers. Pai said that he agreed with the broad principles of net neutrality but that the rules, created in 2015, went too far in restricting broadband providers. “I think they were appreciative,” Pai said of the tech companies. “I have been soliciting thoughts on online protections.” Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

He has the broad support of Republican lawmakers and is expected to introduce a plan that would weaken aspects of the net neutrality rules as soon as this month. Loading comments...

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About April 22, 2017 New Part Day: Very Cheap LIDAR 63 Comments by: Brian Benchoff April 20, 2017 Self-driving cars are, apparently, the next big thing. This thought is predicated on advancements in machine vision and cheaper, better sensors. For the machine vision part of the equation, Nvidia, Intel, and Google are putting out some interesting bits of hardware. The sensors, though? We’re going to need LIDAR, better distance sensors, more capable CAN bus dongles, and the equipment to tie it all together. This is the cheapest LIDAR we’ve ever seen. The RPLIDAR is a new product from Seeed Studios, and it’s an affordable LIDAR for everyone. $400 USD gets you one module, and bizarrely $358 USD gets you two modules. Don’t ask questions — this price point was unheard of a mere five years ago. Basically, this LIDAR unit is a spinning module connected to a motor via a belt. A laser range finder is hidden in the spinny bits and connected to a UART and USB interface through a slip ring. Mount this LIDAR unit on a robot, apply power, and the spinny bit does its thing at about 400-500 RPM. The tata that comes out includes distance (in millimeters), bearing (in units of degrees), quality of the measurement, and a start flag once every time the head makes a revolution. If you’ve never converted polar to cartesian coordinates, this is a great place to start. Although self-driving cars and selfie drones are the future, this part is probably unsuitable for any project with sufficient mass or velocity. The scanning range of this LIDAR is only about 6 meters and insufficient for retrofitting a Toyota Camry with artificial intelligence. That said, this is a cheap LIDAR that opens the door to a lot of experimentation ranging from small robots to recreating that one Radiohead video.

Brian only does this to make sure we’re paying attention. Report comment Reply radiusmike says: April 20, 2017 at 9:18 pm Check out the $40 LIDAR units from China. We have several of them. Range up to 60m. Acquisition rate not as high or trade off accuracy vs.rate. Reliable. Manuals are typical People’s Republic, but dirt simple to figure out. Can get them for as low as $33 in volume of 10 or more. Lidar-lite worked well in the lab, but awful in the field. And at $140???

I’m sure you could scan it back and forth yourself for less than the remaining $290, if it’s not a critical application. I’m not 100% convinced, but I might give them a play when I’ve popped the next 5 projects off my ‘to hack’ pile.

This price point was interesting 7 years ago, and completely mundane 5 years ago. This is still cool because Neato have never sold the sensor by itself, and sometimes it’s hard to explain to your boss why you’re expensing a vacuum cleaner. But it’s hardly revolutionary. Report comment Reply Joe says: April 20, 2017 at 4:11 pm This seems to be A1 unit that has been replaced by the newer (better???) A2, so basically clearing old stock.

Or for a smaller size and range, a Leap Motion, but that’s parallax based rather than time based “classical” LIDAR. Report comment Reply rasz_pl says: April 21, 2017 at 10:23 am while Kinect v1 and by proxy all the PrimeSense based products give you depth field straight up (2D Z-buffer array), Xbox one Kinect requires a TON of math to arrive at the same result, ~ 80 Nvidia shaders of computation. Report comment Reply Andy Dodd says: April 21, 2017 at 1:04 pm That one doesn’t scan. The Scanse Sweep is basically $200 worth of slip rings and rotating stuff added to what you linked to create a 2-D 360 degree solution – the 1-D ranging solution of the Sweep is a Garmin LIDAR-Lite v3. Nowhere near the sampling rate or angular resolution of a SICK/Hokuyo/etc. but FAR cheaper. Also the Sweep (if it ever ships, I now consider availability of “Kickstarter” to be below “announced product with no release date) has a range of 40m (same as the Garmin it uses) which is far greater than that of the Neato LIDAR or the RPLIDAR. The RPLIDAR seems to be the closest thing to a “standalone Neato” you can buy. In fact the first-gen units look STRANGELY like Neato cannibalizations/pulls. Report comment Reply iliasam says: April 20, 2017 at 9:10 pm Compare the sample rate: there is a big difference. Report comment Reply tyrel says: April 21, 2017 at 5:35 am Compare also the range, and the fact that the Sweep (claims to) work in sunlight. If you want to use it outdoor, the Sweep looks clearly more appropriate. This is actually a completely different technology : the RPLIDAR is not technically a LIDAR sensor, but a triangulation system based on laser. The Sweep uses a real LIDAR sensor (apparently a yet unreleased new version of the LidarLite) Report comment Reply gh0stwriter88 says: April 21, 2017 at 10:23 am “a triangulation system based on laser” …. aka a LIDAR by any other name. If i uses light to do the ranging it is a LIDAR… some have pros and cons in different situations it doesn’t make them fake as you imply. Report comment Reply radiusmike says: April 20, 2017 at 9:12 pm This Lidar-Lite is junk. We have two of them and set it up precisely as suggested from Garmin using both I2C and PWM modes, the 680uF cap, etc.. They worked for a while, then constantly lost the link to the processor and will not work very well in the rain, so an indoor, delicate lab toy. Report comment Reply Jan Ciger (@janoc200) says: April 20, 2017 at 4:34 pm Isn’t that the Neato vacuum cleaner LIDAR? Normal price for those is around $80-$100 on Amazon or eBay as replacement parts.

Report comment Reply AKA the A says: April 21, 2017 at 5:46 am Obviously cost. Inductive couplings will always leak interference due to the airgap. You’re still limited by the lifetime of the main bearing, so why add expensive and noise-inducing (read more $$$ in better filtering on both stationary and rotating parts) inductive couplings when there’s still a bearing that will wear out eventually. Slip rings are cheap and last surprisingly long at these low speeds, since you’re not transferring a whole lot of power through them. If it had to run at >10k rpm or push a lot of power – absolutely inductive coupling. But at these speeds and power, there’s no benefit, only disadvantages.

It’s ONE trace that is scanning and being modulated against the phosphor screen. The vertical deflection is controlled by a voltage applied to a coil. In this case, you can get your vertical ‘pixels’ by adding a mechanical actuator – a platform – to the mix and use a stepper or similar control mechanism to make the LIDAR assembly point up and down.

By JuricaDujmovic Columnist Playing computer games is more than a pastime for some younger people. It’s a career. A study by Verve Search, an SEO and content agency, sheds new light on the phenomenon of eSports, as competitive gaming is called. Did you know that the League of Legends (multiplayer online battle arena/MOBA) final drew in more viewers than the last game of the 2016 NBA Finals (36 million vs 31 million)? Or that the total eSports prize pool exceeds $93 million? As you can see, competitive gaming has become a serious business. Just how serious? Let’s talk numbers. ESports viewership has been growing steadily, from 76 million occasional and 56 million frequent viewers in 2012, to a staggering 194 million and 191 million, respectively, in 2017. Statista projections take those numbers even further, expecting them to rise to 286 million and 303 million, respectively, by 2020. To put this into perspective, male millennials in the U.S. already watch eSports as much as they do baseball and ice hockey. Along with the audience, the number of pro gamers has also been growing rapidly. In 2012, there were 4,246 of them, while in 2016 there were 13,555. Big prizes So we have the audience and the digital athletes — all we’re missing now are prizes. And they are generous, indeed. Winning a major golf tournament, such as the U.S. Open, can actually be less lucrative than winning Dota 2 (another MOBA tournament). Each member of the Wings Gaming team who won The International 2016 Dota 2 tournament went home with $1.83 million in prize money. The gamer with the most money earned is Saahil Arora (team UNiVeRsE), a U.S. Dota 2 player who made $1.73 million in 2015, his best year. In comparison, Dustin Johnson was awarded $1.8 million for winning the 2016 U.S. Open, and Sergio Garcia, the winner of the 2017 Masters, took home $1.98 million. From 2013 to 2016, the amount of money handed out across all eSports games more than quadrupled, from $21.4 million to $93.3 million. This year could breach the $150 million mark, an almost 100-fold increase from 2003. Countries with the biggest winnings in 2016 were China ($19.3 million), the U.S. ($14.7 million) and South Korea ($11.9 million). If you’re thinking about becoming a pro gamer, you may be interested in seeing which games rake in the most dough: Although Dota 2 overshadows all other games, Heroes of the Storm (released in June 2015) and Hearthstone (March 2014) have breached the top 10 and are poised to overthrow Counter-Strike by the turn of 2018. Companies take notice Such growth has attracted the attention of big companies like Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.05%  and Red Bull, which not only sponsored, but also worked on organizing their own events, for gamers to compete in. Other prominent sponsors include Logitech International SA LOGI, -1.02% Razer and Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% which has been sponsoring such events for over 10 years. Sponsors pay good money to get event exposure as teams feature their insignias on their jerseys, websites and social media. As it is with other sports, age plays a significant role in a player’s success. Historically, 25 has been the most lucrative age for professional gamers. Beyond 25, there is a big drop-off in earnings potential, with ages 31-33 marking the leanest range for gamers aged 15 or above. College scholarships So the next time you see your child playing computer games, think twice before saying it’s a waste of time. Gaming could get your kid into college. On April 6, the University of Utah announced it would be offering scholarships for League of Legends players, following in the footsteps of the University of California, Irvine. There you have it. ESports can no longer be ignored or belittled. What do you think about eSports? Would you support your child in becoming a pro gamer? Or would you yourself take the chance?

By JuricaDujmovic Columnist Playing computer games is more than a pastime for some younger people. It’s a career. A study by Verve Search, an SEO and content agency, sheds new light on the phenomenon of eSports, as competitive gaming is called. Did you know that the League of Legends (multiplayer online battle arena/MOBA) final drew in more viewers than the last game of the 2016 NBA Finals (36 million vs 31 million)? Or that the total eSports prize pool exceeds $93 million? As you can see, competitive gaming has become a serious business. Just how serious? Let’s talk numbers. ESports viewership has been growing steadily, from 76 million occasional and 56 million frequent viewers in 2012, to a staggering 194 million and 191 million, respectively, in 2017. Statista projections take those numbers even further, expecting them to rise to 286 million and 303 million, respectively, by 2020. To put this into perspective, male millennials in the U.S. already watch eSports as much as they do baseball and ice hockey. Along with the audience, the number of pro gamers has also been growing rapidly. In 2012, there were 4,246 of them, while in 2016 there were 13,555. Big prizes So we have the audience and the digital athletes — all we’re missing now are prizes. And they are generous, indeed. Winning a major golf tournament, such as the U.S. Open, can actually be less lucrative than winning Dota 2 (another MOBA tournament). Each member of the Wings Gaming team who won The International 2016 Dota 2 tournament went home with $1.83 million in prize money. The gamer with the most money earned is Saahil Arora (team UNiVeRsE), a U.S. Dota 2 player who made $1.73 million in 2015, his best year. In comparison, Dustin Johnson was awarded $1.8 million for winning the 2016 U.S. Open, and Sergio Garcia, the winner of the 2017 Masters, took home $1.98 million. From 2013 to 2016, the amount of money handed out across all eSports games more than quadrupled, from $21.4 million to $93.3 million. This year could breach the $150 million mark, an almost 100-fold increase from 2003. Countries with the biggest winnings in 2016 were China ($19.3 million), the U.S. ($14.7 million) and South Korea ($11.9 million).

However, the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform that powers Samsung’s phone will also power Windows 10 devices later this year. The chipmaker confirmed that Windows 10 devices based on the Snapdragon 835 system-on-a-chip (SoC) will be available in stores in the fourth quarter. Don't Miss: It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked “Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year,” Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said during the company’s Q2 earnings call on Thursday. That’s hardly a surprise, ZDNet explains, as Microsoft and Qualcomm announced last December that always-on cellular Windows 10 PCs based on ARM chips will be launched this year. But this is the first time either company announced a launch timeframe for these devices. The Snapdragon 835 chip will run full Windows 10 desktop compiled natively for ARM SoCs. These devices will support both universal Windows apps as well as Win32 apps (via an emulator). Qualcomm wants to bring some smartphone technologies made possible by the new chip to Windows 10 PCs, including Gigabit LTE and battery-saving tech to Windows 10 devices that will be ultralight, and always connected to a network. This is certainly an exciting announcement for the future of the PC, and Intel should be worried. The Snapdragon 835 is the fastest chip in town when it comes to Android devices, and next generations will be even faster and more energy efficient. Sure, they won’t serve the needs of “Pro” users who need plenty of computing power, but they’ll be great for mobile computing. And if Qualcomm is already confident its ARM chips can power PC experiences, then there’s one other reason to be excited. If there’s one rival Qualcomm can’t beat in mobile chips performance, it’s Apple. There’s one rumor that keeps coming back saying Apple is working on its own ARM-based Macs. The more advanced its A-series chip get, the more likely it is to see such devices — don’t get too excited about Macs running on A11 chips just yet.

While the company promised an update in mid-February, we haven't heard anything about it until now. Today, the company introduced Power Throttling, which is already available in the latest Redstone 3 build, 16176. The new feature is meant to preserve battery life, and Microsoft says that when it tested it in January, there was up to an 11% reduction in CPU power consumption, "for some of the most strenuous use cases." Basically, it works by cutting down on CPU access for apps that are in the background, prioritizing apps in the foreground, those that are playing music, and some other "categories of important work we infer from the demands of running apps and the apps the user interacts with". There will also be APIs to allow developers greater control over this. As a user, you also have control over Power Throttling. You can control it system-wide with a Power Slider, or you can adjust it on an app-by-app basis through Battery Settings. Unfortunately, the technology is only available for devices with Intel's sixth-generation Skylake chips or higher. It uses Intel Speed Shift, so that means that there's also no support for AMD's new Ryzen chips just yet. Microsoft says that it's working to bring support to more processors over the next few months. Also, the company says that Power Throttling isn't the final name for the feature, and that it may change between now and when it's released with Redstone 3 later this year.

Quotes in the article Kimberly-Clark Corp KMB ▼ 129.96 -1.27 -0.97% Hasbro Inc HAS ▲ 96.03 +0.02 +0.02% Mattel Inc MAT ▼ 21.79 -3.42 -13.57% Broadcom Ltd AVGO ▼ 217.66 -0.55 -0.25% AdChoices "On Monday, we hear from Kimberly-Clark (KMB) and I've had the same view about this stock since my days at Goldman Sachs in the '80s. You buy Kimberly-Clark when it gets hit. This is a strategy that's never failed me, and I bet this time will be no different," the "Mad Money" host said. With the first round of the French election occurring on Sunday — and the biggest week of earnings approaching — Jim Cramer smells panic in the air. He recommended focusing on individual company reports that can help shed light on the true state of the global economy. With that in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week: Hasbro (HAS) will report earnings alongside Kimberly-Clark on Monday, and Cramer said rival toymaker Mattel's (MAT) weak Thursday earnings report should not drag Hasbro down. "Hasbro's developed a very different model from Mattel's. It's more experiential, and it does a huge amount of business selling Disney (DIS) toys, and given that we've got a new 'Star Wars' movie later this year [and] maybe a couple of 'Star Wars' movies down the line, I bet it's a winner, not a loser like Mattel," Cramer said. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer Tuesday brings an onslaught of over 30 major earnings reports including Chipotle's (CMG), and the fast-casual chain is approaching the 18-month mark at which health-risk concerns begin to taper out. That is good news for the company moving forward, Cramer said. "However, the stock's already had a big run. I don't want you to chase. There are so many people who expect it to be a great quarter that we need to be sensitive to the idea that the improving news may actually cause a short term sell-off before the stock advances again," the "Mad Money" host advised.© Provided by CNBC The earnings wave continues on Wednesday, with United Technologies (UTX), PepsiCo (PEP), and Twitter (TWTR) reporting, among others. Cramer knows there is a hidden market out there for Twitter, particularly among those with accounts, so he is curious to see what kind of reaction a weak quarter might get. "I say it's too risky, at least until we see those [earnings] numbers. Then we make a decision," he said. Southwest Airlines (LUV) will report earnings before Thursday's bell, and Cramer says that having no overseas routes will be a boon to the stock. "Call me a buyer both before and after what I think is going to be a terrific report," Cramer said, adding that he owns the name for his charitable trust, ActionAlertsPlus.com. And with oil prices expected to head back to $47 from Friday's $49.50, Cramer says both Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) will be buys if they announce any good news on their earnings calls next Friday. "Hope for panic next week and take action when you get it with some of these great opportunities," Cramer said. © Provided by CNBC As cyberattacks grow in power and number, Proofpoint (PFPT) CEO Gary Steele sees them moving from targeting organizations to hacking individuals through email and social media. "We're all about protecting individuals and we've seen the threat landscape really move in that direction, where bad actors are targeting people, not infrastructure, these days," Steele told Cramer on Friday. "As a result of that, companies need to buy protection that Proofpoint provides," the CEO said. While cyberattackers are often very skilled at mimicking a company's email style in order to trick unassuming workers, Steele said Proofpoint serves as a formidable defense. "We employ a big team of threat researchers and data scientists, and through the innovation that we provide, we are very good at detecting these kinds of things," Steele told Cramer. Cramer also turned to a favorite technology play, Broadcom (AVGO), to look ahead at any possibly takeover candidates for the smart and voracious acquirer. The "Mad Money" host came up with two ideas. First was Xilinx (XLNX), a maker of programmable chips that shares its slice of the semiconductor space with Intel (INTC). "Why would Broadcom think to buy this one? First of all, it would give them more exposure to some very attractive end markets like communications, data centers, connected car, [and] aerospace, among others," Cramer said. Cramer also acknowledged the buzz around Broadcom possibly buying struggling Japanese electronics giant Toshiba (6502.T-JP), but said this cheaper buy is a riskier bet. "Given all of the consolidation in the semi space in recent years, there aren't that many attractive takeover candidates left, which is all the more reason for Broadcom to do the straightforward thing and buy Xilinx before someone else snaps it up instead. It wouldn't be cheap, but it would be worth it and no one could integrate this company or get more out of it than Broadcom can," he said. © Provided by CNBC Cramer has noticed over the years that big-name hedge fund managers tend not to comment on, or recommend, high-quality stocks to the average investor. "I bet most of the people who run big hedge funds likely wouldn't be caught dead owning any of those great stocks. If anything, they'd want to short them," the "Mad Money" host observed. From the countless investor letters, stories, and interviews Cramer has seen, he knows very well that no savvy hedge fund titan would dare come out and say he owned a great deal of stock. "The most you'll get out of them is that they aren't all that short…. or at least not yet," he said. In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV): "Well-run, inexpensive drug company. I'd be a buyer." Blackstone Group, LP (BX): "Went through that quarter. They did terrifically. With their IPO window opening, they can re-liquify. I think it's a buy. I've been saying that for a while, though."

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson By Reuters Apr 21, 2017 at 5:07 pm | Print View NEW YORK — Forget about French elections or the flagging Trump trade. Corporate America is set to unleash its biggest profit-reporting fest in at least a decade next week, with more than 190 members of the S&P 500 index delivering quarterly score cards, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The lineup accounts for around 40 percent of the benchmark index’s value, or more than $7.7 trillion, and includes big names like Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Exxon Mobil. The onslaught could keep stock investors’ focus largely on earnings next week even as the world’s attention is likely to be drawn elsewhere. Many strategists have attributed the 10 percent rally in the S&P 500 since Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election to optimism Trump would boost the domestic economy through tax cuts and an infrastructure spending binge. Upbeat earnings from Morgan Stanley and other banks so far this reporting period cushioned geopolitical worries, helping push the S&P 500 up 0.9 percent this week, its best such performance in two months. Shares of smaller companies did even better, with S&P’s benchmark indexes for small and mid-cap stocks notching their best weeks of 2017, with gains of between two percent and thee percent. Expectations for the quarter’s profit growth have risen as well, and the first three months of the year now appear set to mark the strongest quarterly earnings growth in more than five years. In the past week alone, expected S&P 500 first-quarter earnings per share growth rose to 11.2 percent from 10.4 percent, a more than 7 percent jump, according to Thomson Reuters data. Just 76 companies reported this week compared with 134 in the comparable week a year ago. Next week’s rush will represent a 15 percent increase from the 166 S&P constituents that reported in the comparable week last year. Thursday will be the busiest day with nearly 70 reports due, including updates after the closing bell from Alphabet, Amazon, Intel Corp, Microsoft and Starbucks Corp. That could make for a bang in the market on Friday, which is also the final trading day of April, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Like what you're reading?

"On Monday, we hear from Kimberly-Clark and I've had the same view about this stock since my days at Goldman Sachs in the '80s. You buy Kimberly-Clark when it gets hit. This is a strategy that's never failed me, and I bet this time will be no different," the "Mad Money" host said. With the first round of the French election occurring on Sunday — and the biggest week of earnings approaching — Jim Cramer smells panic in the air. He recommended focusing on individual company reports that can help shed light on the true state of the global economy. Getty Images With that in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week: Hasbro will report earnings alongside Kimberly-Clark on Monday, and Cramer said rival toymaker Mattel's weak Thursday earnings report should not drag Hasbro down. "Hasbro's developed a very different model from Mattel's. It's more experiential, and it does a huge amount of business selling Disney toys, and given that we've got a new 'Star Wars' movie later this year [and] maybe a couple of 'Star Wars' movies down the line, I bet it's a winner, not a loser like Mattel," Cramer said. Tuesday brings an onslaught of over 30 major earnings reports including Chipotle's, and the fast-casual chain is approaching the 18-month mark at which health-risk concerns begin to taper out. That is good news for the company moving forward, Cramer said. "However, the stock's already had a big run. I don't want you to chase. There are so many people who expect it to be a great quarter that we need to be sensitive to the idea that the improving news may actually cause a short term sell-off before the stock advances again," the "Mad Money" host advised. The earnings wave continues on Wednesday, with United Technologies, PepsiCo, and Twitter reporting, among others. Cramer knows there is a hidden market out there for Twitter, particularly among those with accounts, so he is curious to see what kind of reaction a weak quarter might get. "I say it's too risky, at least until we see those [earnings] numbers. Then we make a decision," he said. Southwest Airlines will report earnings before Thursday's bell, and Cramer says that having no overseas routes will be a boon to the stock. "Call me a buyer both before and after what I think is going to be a terrific report," Cramer said, adding that he owns the name for his charitable trust, ActionAlertsPlus.com. And with oil prices expected to head back to $47 from Friday's $49.50, Cramer says both Exxon Mobil and Chevron will be buys if they announce any good news on their earnings calls next Friday. "Hope for panic next week and take action when you get it with some of these great opportunities," Cramer said. Bill Hinton | Getty Images As cyberattacks grow in power and number, Proofpoint CEO Gary Steele sees them moving from targeting organizations to hacking individuals through email and social media. "We're all about protecting individuals and we've seen the threat landscape really move in that direction, where bad actors are targeting people, not infrastructure, these days," Steele told Cramer on Friday. "As a result of that, companies need to buy protection that Proofpoint provides," the CEO said. While cyberattackers are often very skilled at mimicking a company's email style in order to trick unassuming workers, Steele said Proofpoint serves as a formidable defense. "We employ a big team of threat researchers and data scientists, and through the innovation that we provide, we are very good at detecting these kinds of things," Steele told Cramer. Cramer also turned to a favorite technology play, Broadcom, to look ahead at any possibly takeover candidates for the smart and voracious acquirer. The "Mad Money" host came up with two ideas. First was Xilinx, a maker of programmable chips that shares its slice of the semiconductor space with Intel. "Why would Broadcom think to buy this one? First of all, it would give them more exposure to some very attractive end markets like communications, data centers, connected car, [and] aerospace, among others," Cramer said. Cramer also acknowledged the buzz around Broadcom possibly buying struggling Japanese electronics giant Toshiba, but said this cheaper buy is a riskier bet. "Given all of the consolidation in the semi space in recent years, there aren't that many attractive takeover candidates left, which is all the more reason for Broadcom to do the straightforward thing and buy Xilinx before someone else snaps it up instead. It wouldn't be cheap, but it would be worth it and no one could integrate this company or get more out of it than Broadcom can," he said. Getty Images George Soros Cramer has noticed over the years that big-name hedge fund managers tend not to comment on, or recommend, high-quality stocks to the average investor. "I bet most of the people who run big hedge funds likely wouldn't be caught dead owning any of those great stocks. If anything, they'd want to short them," the "Mad Money" host observed. From the countless investor letters, stories, and interviews Cramer has seen, he knows very well that no savvy hedge fund titan would dare come out and say he owned a great deal of stock. "The most you'll get out of them is that they aren't all that short…. or at least not yet," he said. In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: AbbVie, Inc.: "Well-run, inexpensive drug company. I'd be a buyer." Blackstone Group, LP: "Went through that quarter. They did terrifically. With their IPO window opening, they can re-liquify. I think it's a buy. I've been saying that for a while, though."

Now... WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) - The Trump administration has denied ExxonMobil permission to bypass sanctions to drill for oil in Russia. "The Treasury Department will not be issuing waivers to U.S. companies, including Exxon, authorizing drilling prohibited by current Russian sanctions," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said in a statement Friday. Mnuchin said he consulted with President Trump on the decision. Exxon had applied for a waiver from sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in a bid to resume its lucrative joint venture with Russian state oil giant PAO Rosneft. "We understand the statement today by Secretary Mnuchin in consultation with President Trump," Exxon said in a statement Friday. "Our 2015 application for a license under the provisions outlined in the U.S. sanctions was made to enable our company to meet its contractual obligations under a joint venture agreement in Russia, where competitor companies are authorized to undertake such work under European sanctions." There are powerful reasons why Exxon would want to get back into business with Rosneft: Their agreement to form a joint venture, signed in 2011, allowed Exxon to conduct offshore exploration in the Black Sea and the Kara Sea in Siberia. The undeveloped oil fields are thought to be the most promising in the Russian Arctic, according to S&P Global Platts. In 2012, the two firms agreed to jointly develop more oil reserves in Siberia and establish a research center in the Arctic. Plans to build a large natural gas plant near Vladivostock in eastern Russia followed in 2013. The deepening relationship was put on hold, however, after the United States, European Union and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its role in the crisis in Ukraine. Exxon, which has been operating in Russia for more than 20 years, was allowed to finish some of its projects. But then the drilling stopped. A lot has changed since then. The Russian economy has turned the corner, emerging from a painful recession in the final quarter of 2016. Oil prices have climbed back above $50 per barrel. The Trump administration is under intense scrutiny over its ties to Moscow. The fact that the current secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, spearheaded the Rosneft deal while CEO of Exxon, has drawn even more attention to the waiver request. Tillerson has recused himself from all government matters involving Exxon. He also sold all his stock in the firm, and is placing the shares he would have received over the next decade into an independently managed trust. But a political storm started brewing earlier this week when the Wall Street Journal first reported that Exxon was seeking a waiver. Sen. John McCain, a Republican, asked "Are they crazy?" when news of the waiver application broke. McCain is a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, said that the waiver should be denied. "The Treasury Department should reject any waiver from sanctions which would allow Exxon Mobile or any other company to resume business with prohibited Russian entities," he said in a statement. "I was very surprised Exxon did this because it would be bad publicity. The secretary of state was only on the job for two months and they already tried to get behind the sanctions," said Fadel Gheit, managing director of Oppenheimer & Co.'s oil and gas research division. Still, the financial incentives for Exxon are powerful when it comes to Russia. "Exxon is a big company. It's very hard for anything to move the needle," said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones. "Russia could potentially be that, years out. It potentially could be very lucrative." In March 2016, Tillerson said that Exxon was "very anxious to get back to work there." His successor echoed that hope earlier this year. "In Russia, we're there for the long term," CEO Darren Woods said in a February interview with Forbes. --Ivana Kottasova and Julia Horowitz also contributed to this report.

That stripped down flavor of Windows 8 was a commercial and critical flop, but Microsoft aims to make ARM-based PCs a thing in the era of Windows 10. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf provided an update on the future of Windows on ARM in a recent investor call, saying the first Qualcomm-based Windows PCs will be available at the end of this year. Microsoft and Qualcomm first revealed this plan in December 2016, but there was little in the way of details at the time. What we do know is Microsoft has learned from the past, and it won’t be going down the same path as Windows RT. That version of the OS lacked support for true desktop apps, relying completely on the so-called Modern UI apps that rolled out with Windows 8. In its new take on ARM PCs, Microsoft has developed a built-in emulator that can run regular desktop apps on the ARM architecture. Mollenkopf made his comments in connection with the Snapdragon 835, the latest chip from Qualcomm that is currently only available in the Galaxy S8. This is a quad-core chip based on Qualcomm’s custom Kryo 280 64-bit CPU core. In current configurations, it can be clocked as high as 2.45GHz. In a demo last December, Microsoft showed a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 running Windows 10 without any appreciable lag. It worked fine in Edge and even booted up Photoshop in a respectable amount of time. The main selling point here is efficiency — a PC powered by an ARM SoC could run for much longer, and the on-die support for cellular modems means it’ll be easier for OEMs to include mobile data. ARM chips should also be cheaper than Intel or AMD, which means cheaper machines. Microsoft has seen less expensive devices like Chromebooks and iPads eat into sales of Windows laptops, and many of these devices run on ARM. However, ARM-based Chromebooks tend to use less powerful (and therefore cheaper) ARM chips. Windows needs the power of something like the Snapdragon 835 to be viable. OEMs might find the savings over Intel parts to be smaller than expected. The first wave of ARM Windows devices will come from brands other than Microsoft — Lenovo is rumored to be planning a convertible laptop of some sort. We may get a peek at some early ARM-based Windows devices at the Build conference in May.

With all the chaos and dysfunction at the top, the Administration’s many pro-corporate regulatory initiatives are being somewhat overlooked by both the media and the public at large. This is wrong: these are decisions and actions that will have harmful consequences, and Trump’s own supporters will be among those hurt. Consider the Environmental Protection Agency, where Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma Attorney General who has long served as a protector of the oil and gas industry, is busy hiring fellow-climate-change skeptics to help him carry out Trump’s edict to dismantle the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan. The end result seems certain to be increased carbon emissions. Pruitt’s aides are also drawing up plans to lay off many of the people at the agency who actually believe in environmental protection. In the budget proposal he released earlier this year, Trump called for the E.P.A.’s funding to be cut by almost a third. According to the Washington Post, Pruitt’s staff has drawn up a detailed plan that would eliminate a quarter of the agency’s workforce and fifty-six of its programs, including ones designed to clean up the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Puget Sound. Pruitt is a lightning rod, so the E.P.A. gets a fair amount of attention from news outlets, even, occasionally, from television news programs. This isn’t the case for other agencies whose missions have also tilted sharply right since January, such as the Federal Communications Commission. In 2013, when Barack Obama appointed Tom Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable industry, to chair the F.C.C., many commentators, myself included, expressed concern. Wheeler, however, turned out to be a forceful regulator. He rejected the cable industry’s calls to end net neutrality—the principle that Internet-service providers should treat all content providers equally—and supported applying the “common carrier” telephone law to I.S.P.s, rather than continuing to treat them under the less onerous set of rules that apply to “information services.” Wheeler resigned in January. To replace him, Trump promoted Ajit Pai, another Obama appointee to the F.C.C., but one whom Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, had recommended. Under Pai’s leadership, the F.C.C. has already taken numerous steps to roll back regulation and preserve or enhance the power of monopolistic providers like A.T. & T., Verizon (where Pai once worked), and Comcast. On Thursday, the agency moved to eliminate price caps on broadband services marketed to heavy users of data, such as businesses, hospitals, and schools. This change followed decisions to end a program designed to help poor people obtain broadband access, and to reverse an initiative that would have allowed cable customers to buy their own set-top boxes. (At the moment, cable providers force people to rent their boxes at high prices.) Explaining the decision to deregulate broadband data services, Pai parroted the standard conservative line that “price regulation threatens competition and investment.” The reality is that, in most areas, cable companies face little or no competition. The F.C.C.’s own research shows that close to three-quarters of business customers have a single provider of business data services, and ninety-seven per cent have two or fewer providers. In monopolistic markets like this, the only way to prevent incumbents from gouging their customers is to regulate their behavior. The inevitable result of Thursday’s ruling will be higher prices for Internet users. As Phillip Berenbroick, a senior policy counsel at the digital-rights group Public Knowledge, pointed out in a statement, “consumers, and American families and businesses will pay dearly for the green light the FCC has given to the unfettered exercise of market power by dominant telecommunications providers.” Although Pai hasn’t yet targeted the F.C.C.’s broader endorsement of net neutrality, this looks like only a matter of time. This week, he announced that he’s been soliciting views from executives at Internet companies, such as Facebook and Intel, which are vehemently opposed to any change in the rules. On Thursday, the Times reported that Pai “is expected to introduce a plan that would weaken aspects of the net neutrality rules as soon as this month.” When he does, he will almost certainly receive strong support from the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Underlying all of these developments is a message from the Trump Administration to corporate America: the rules of the game are changing. The message has been heard, and the players are reacting to it accordingly. Dow Chemical, for example, is pressing the Administration to ignore scientific findings that some of its pesticides are harmful to endangered species. In letters addressed to the heads of three federal agencies, including the E.P.A., company lawyers “asked them ‘to set aside’ the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed,” the Associated Press reported on Thursday. Dow Chemical contributed a million dollars to the Trump Inauguration committee, and the company’s chairman, Andrew Liveris, is heading a White House working group on manufacturing. If that seems like blatant influence peddling, ExxonMobil has outdone it. The giant oil company, whose former C.E.O., Rex Tillerson, is now Secretary of State, is demanding an exemption from U.S. economic sanctions on Russia. In 2012, Exxon reached a big exploration deal with Rosneft, an energy company owned by the Russian government. Following the invasion and annexation of Crimea, the Obama Administration imposed sanctions on Russia, which brought the deal to a halt. In July, 2015, Exxon applied to the Treasury Department for an exemption that would allow it to start drilling with Rosneft in the Black Sea, but this request was turned down. The company “renewed a push for approval in March, shortly after its most recent chief executive, Rex Tillerson, became secretary of state,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. When Senator John McCain heard about Exxon’s renewed application for an exemption, he tweeted, “Are they crazy?” A State Department spokesperson told the Journal that Tillerson, who received a Russian Order of Friendship in recognition of his role in striking the exploration deal with Rosneft, won’t be involved in any decisions that involve his former firm. On Friday afternoon, the Treasury Department issued a one-sentence statement saying it would “not be issuing waivers to U.S. companies, including Exxon, authorizing drilling prohibited by current Russian sanctions.” Evidently, all the adverse publicity about Exxon’s request for special treatment had an impact. But it and other big companies won’t be put off. They know they have friends in the Administration, including the self-styled populist in the Oval Office. Also on Friday, Trump signed another of his Presidential edicts, this one ordering a review of two reforms that Congress passed after the banking system almost collapsed in 2008. It is probably fair to say that most Americans don’t know what role the Financial Stability Oversight Council plays, or what powers Orderly Liquidation Authority grants to the federal government in the case of another crisis. But the big banks know all about them, and they don’t like either of them. Ergo, they are on the chopping block. Whether or not fans of Ted Nugent and Kid Rock have realized it yet, that is how the Trump Administration works.

Government funding is one approach. FairPoint has finished rural broadband projects in 25 Vermont communities with funding from the FCC’s Connect America Fund II (CAF II) rural broadband expansion program. The project will feature increased speeds to 4,500 locations. Some will have broadband for the first time, FierceTelecom says. Each upgraded site will have a minimum of 15 Megabit per second (Mbps) download speeds via digital subscriber line (DSL) technology. FairPoint accepted CAF-II funding in 2015. The company is being acquired by Consolidated Communications, which said that it will continue to participate in the program. Big Telcos Going for Unlicensed Spectrum The move of telecommunications to unlicensed spectrum will gather steam as operators add to 4G speeds and move into the 5G era, according to Light Reading. Three of the four large operators are employing the strategy. Verizon plans to use 5GHz LTE-Unlicensed in California, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas. T-Mobile US and AT&T plan tests in the 3.5GHz range. Unlicensed LTE will be deployed during LTE-Advanced upgrades via small base stations. The unlicensed spectrum is attractive because it is free. Verizon Asks for Test Extension Carrier use of that unlicensed spectrum is no slam dunk, however. Verizon has asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a special temporary authority (STA) to continue conducting LTE-U tests, says RCR Wireless. An earlier STA under which Verizon was operating six sites was set to expire last Sunday. The request, which was received on Saturday, sought an extension until October. Qualcomm is testing with Verizon and T-Mobile. The use of unlicensed spectrum for LTE and 5G is a contentious issue. That spectrum is already used by the Wi-Fi industry and indeed is one of the reasons that that sector has been so successful. The question lingering over the debate between the telephone company ecosystems on one side and the Wi-Fi players, led by the cable industry, on the other, is to what degree the objections are technical and to what extent they are tactical attempts to preclude competition. FCC Chairman Pai’s Listening Tour It’s been well established during the first three months of the Trump presidency that the FCC will roll back many, if not all, of the Open Internet Rules and related regulations. What isn’t clear yet is with what they will be replaced. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has visited with executives from Facebook, Cisco, Oracle and Intel to try to figure that out. The New York Times suggests that Pai agrees with “the broad principles of net neutrality” but thinks that Obama-era moves went too far and that those goals can be achieved in other ways. It’s clear, however, that if he errs, he intends to do so on the side of cutting back on rules: He has abolished a proposal to open the cable box market and frozen a program for broadband subsidies for low-income households. On Thursday, he passed two actions that will ease pricing restrictions on telecom giants and give broadcast television companies greater latitude to bulk up through mergers. The question now is whether Pai is serious about listening to companies that back net neutrality or whether he wants to blunt criticism by appearing amenable to those positions. New IoT Device Malware Detected There’s always something new in the world of security, and the new thing is very rarely pleasant. In early April, security firm Radware spotted dangerous new malware called BrickerBot. The malware attacks Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are only secured by their default usernames and passwords, says ZDNet. When it finds such a device, it trashes the storage. This causes permanent denial-of-service (PDoS), also is known as bricking. This is another exploit that depends upon the ignorance or passivity of device owners to succeed.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Big laptop roundup Best 17-inch Laptop By Richard Devine Thursday, Apr 20, 2017 at 11:00 am EDT Best Overall Runner up Ultimate power The best ASUS ROG Strix GL702 See at Amazon ASUS took the archetypical 17-inch gaming laptop beast and hit it with a shrinkray. Well, not that, but they did rip out the bulky optical drive and literally trim the excess around the laptop to bring it down in size. And that's without any scrimping on the hardware, too. With a G-Sync display, GTX 1060 and Core i7 processor, the Strix GL702 is well equipped, well priced and well sized. Bottom line: Probably the most portable high-end 17-inch laptop ever made. One more thing: At around $1,500 the GL702 also represents remarkably good value. Why the ASUS ROG Strix GL702 is the best 17-inch laptops are very much a niche, but still, something that certain consumers must have. Traditionally, 17-inch laptops are big, heavy, cumbersome brutes that aren't exactly portable without a serious case of backache. This is a 17-inch laptop not much bigger than a 15-inch. Which is awesome. ASUS changed that with the GL702, making a laptop that packs a 17-inch display inside a body not much larger or heavier than your average 15-inch laptop. That alone makes it enticing, as does the remarkable sub-$1,500 price tag considering what you get for your money. Inside it's packing a Core i7 processor from Intel and a GTX 1060 GPU from NVIDIA, paired up with a G-Sync 17.3-inch 1080p display. It weighs just under 6lbs, has tons of storage and is easily upgradeable. It's also not particularly wild styling, considering it's primarily a gaming laptop. So you can use it in public without feeling embarrassed. Runner up Alienware 17 See at Dell Long popular with gamers and creative professionals alike, Alienware's latest big laptop is definitely its best yet. It loses some thickness by dropping the optical drive, but has so much power and connectivity it's hard to know where to begin. The options go up to a GTX 1080 GPU with G-Sync display, all with the latest generation Intel Core i7 processors, including unlocked versions for overclocking. It's larger and more expensive than the ASUS at equivalent spec, but it does have a party trick in the form of Tobii eye tracking technology. Bottom line: Powerful and packed with options to get exactly the laptop you want. One more thing: Go hands-free with the integrated Tobii eye tracking technology. Ultimate power Razer Blade Pro See at Razer It's impossible to talk about 17-inch laptops without including Razer's epic Blade Pro. While out of reach for many due to its high price, this is as close to the ultimate laptop as you can get right now. The latest refresh brings an overclockable Core i7 processor, a GTX 1080 GPU, 4K touch display, RAID 0 storage and as much connectivity as you could possibly ever want. All wrapped up in a stylish, and surprisingly thin metal body. The only drawback is that it keeps going out of stock. Bottom line: Pricey, but it's hard to find a laptop with better hardware right now. One more thing: The low profile mechanical keyboard takes time to get used to, but it's a dream when you are. The best ASUS ROG Strix GL702 See at Amazon ASUS took the archetypical 17-inch gaming laptop beast and hit it with a shrinkray. Well, not that, but they did rip out the bulky optical drive and literally trim the excess around the laptop to bring it down in size. It did it without scrimping on the hardware, too. With a G-Sync display, GTX 1060 and Core i7 processor, the Strix GL702 is well equipped, well priced and well sized. Bottom line: Probably the most portable high-end 17-inch laptop ever made.

McIntyre April 20, 2017 6:30 am EDT Print Email Tweet When RadioShack announced it would go bankrupt two months ago, it was the second time in two years. The company’s parent, General Wireless, said it would close several hundred stores and “evaluate options” for the rest. However, RadioShack.com is still up and running and offers bargains across a large number of consumer electronics categories. A lot of what RadioShack sells online is from the older electronics categories that made it a retail powerhouse. These include scanners, weather radios and walkie-talkies. Manufacturer Midland makes these. The set with a range of 20 miles sells for $27.99. The product is part of a liquidation of inventory. It is marked down from $34.99, and there were only 16 sets left on last check. Another staple RadioShack has sold for decades is batteries. It does not have any natural advantage, since almost all consumer electronics, big-box and department store retailers sell them as well. But RadioShack concentrates on its own brand, and they are not cheap. Their 16 AAA alkaline battery pack costs $11.89. At Amazon, 16 high-end EverReady Gold AAA batteries cost $9.30. RadioShack sells drones online, and they are inexpensive. The most expensive model is the RadioShack 8.75-inch Zeraxa 2.0 camera drone for $104.99. However, it is sold out online. (This is true of a number of online sold products and may be a signal that RadioShack has inventory problems.) That leaves the RadioShack Vektor 2.0 Micro Drone for $34.99. It has four propellers, can move in any direction: up, down, side to side or in a loop. RadioShack says it is for beginners. It doesn’t have a camera. RadioShack sells a lot of toys: cars, trucks, motorcycles and boats. They are radio controlled and mostly cheap, like the RadioShack 1966 Pontiac GTO 1:15 scale for $24.49. Electronics tools have been a mainstay of RadioShack for years. They are primarily for hobbyists who want to build their own devices. These include soldering irons, chip testers and a 58-piece precision screwdriver set that sells for $15.39. RadioShack has an entire collection of home electronics products. These range from alarm clocks to voice recorders to flashlights. RadioShack even sells home protection devices, but not entire systems. You can only buy security cameras like the Belkin Wemo Netcam HD+ for $79.99. RadioShack is still in the market of PC and laptop component sales. It does not sell computers, however. Online, it sells memory sticks like the Intel Compute Stick Generation 2 for $104.99. More in keeping with its hobbyist bent, RadioShack sells PC cables and modem adapters, like the RadioShack four-foot high-speed with Ethernet HDMI cable for $20. RadioShack still sells car electronics online. This includes GPS devices, audio accessories and cell phone mounts. Some of these are almost certainly only useful for old cars, like the RadioShack cassette adapter for $17.49. Most people don’t use cassettes anymore — anywhere. RadioShack sells entire lines of tools online. These range from parts with which people can build their own radios to clearers and wipers to 3D printing components. In the 3D section, RadioShack sells a 3D former draw pen, which allows people to draw 3D images in space. For $47.99, customers have to back order it and wait. Or find a store, which is harder and harder to do. Finally, the height of hobbyist sections at RadioShack’s site is called the “Parts Drawer.” It does not have a single completed product. It does have buzzers, sockets, capacitors, fans, fuses, knobs, motors, screws and magnets. In this section, its sell RadioShack graphite-filled conductive wire glue for $5.27. However, like many products RadioShack has online, it is out of stock. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.95%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31.

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap.

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.95%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31. Apple had reached a record close about a month before it entered the Dow, but didn’t set another record until nearly two years after it gained admittance. The following table shows how the newcomers performed relative to their replacements: Stock added (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Stock removed (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Apple (AAPL) -16.9 AT&T (T) -17.2 Goldman Sachs (GS) +9.2 Bank of America (BAC) +17.9 Visa (V) +7.6 Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) +72.0 Nike (NKE) +16.3 Alcoa (AA) +91.0 S&P Dow Jones Indices, FactSet Before investors criticize the Dow keepers, for turning new age growth companies into old-school blue chips, just look how they’ve performed relative to the broader stock market. Since Nov. 1, 1999, when the first Nasdaq-listed technology companies were admitted, the correlation coefficient between the Dow and the S&P 500 has been 0.9797, according to an analysis of FactSet data, or just shy of a perfect match. The Dow has climbed 93.33% since then, while the S&P 500 has advanced 73.80%. FactSet Don’t miss: Dow hitting 20,000 is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned. So if Amazon splits its stock, starts paying a dividend, and it eventually enters the Dow, investors may want to step aside for a while. But check back a year later, and see if Buffett has finally become a believer.

The revision 3.0 of the specification formally integrates the new Type 7 pinout type which is the basis for congatec’s Server-on-Modules. The official release fires the starting shot for the race to a new generation of server designs based on standardized Server-on-Modules. These products enable the most cost efficient server designs and performance upgrades across all existing and upcoming generations of server class processors and sockets from any vendor. Modular server designs can be started instantly as modules, carrier boards, starter kits, design guides and circuit schematics are readily available. “Server farms need constant upgrades to improve the performance and energy efficiency per rack. With the new Server-on-Modules, operators can execute these upgrades by simply exchanging standardized modules instead of complete and costly server boards or even rack systems,” explains Christian Eder, editor of the PICMG COM Express 3.0 specification and director marketing at congatec, the benefits of Server-on-Modules for cloudlets, edge and fog severs as well as any kind of data center servers tasked with delivering constantly improved rack performance at lower prices. Server-on-Modules are also an excellent fit for all the various embedded and IoT server designs in harsh industrial environments where space is restricted and dedicated high-bandwidth interfaces are essential to connect the various controls in the industry 4.0 fields. Here, Server-on-Modules can massively improve design efficiency. This is of major significance for embedded design engineers as recent studies report that they are facing the challenge to constantly manage more projects within a given or even shorter time frame, leading to massive time pressure for executing each project. Server-on-Modules can deliver the vital design efficiency improvements by providing an application ready server core instead of only a hand full of individual components. COM Express Type 7 Server-on-Modules, carrier boards and starter kits can be requested by customers for the evaluation of the new generation of modules. congatec’s recent Server-on-Module designs offer server-grade performance and functionality with their Intel® Xeon® D processors, 2x 10 GbE and 32 PCIe lanes. The latter can be used for powerful intrasystem expansions such as GPGUs and NVMe based ultra-fast storage devices as well as multi-module configurations on one single carrier board for High Performance Computing designs.

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.95%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31. Apple had reached a record close about a month before it entered the Dow, but didn’t set another record until nearly two years after it gained admittance. The following table shows how the newcomers performed relative to their replacements: Stock added (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Stock removed (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Apple (AAPL) -16.9 AT&T (T) -17.2 Goldman Sachs (GS) +9.2 Bank of America (BAC) +17.9 Visa (V) +7.6 Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) +72.0 Nike (NKE) +16.3 Alcoa (AA) +91.0 S&P Dow Jones Indices, FactSet Before investors criticize the Dow keepers, for turning new age growth companies into old-school blue chips, just look how they’ve performed relative to the broader stock market. Since Nov. 1, 1999, when the first Nasdaq-listed technology companies were admitted, the correlation coefficient between the Dow and the S&P 500 has been 0.9797, according to an analysis of FactSet data, or just shy of a perfect match. The Dow has climbed 93.33% since then, while the S&P 500 has advanced 73.80%. FactSet Don’t miss: Dow hitting 20,000 is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned. So if Amazon splits its stock, starts paying a dividend, and it eventually enters the Dow, investors may want to step aside for a while. But check back a year later, and see if Buffett has finally become a believer.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > AMD quietly launches entry-level Radeon RX 540… AMD quietly launches entry-level Radeon RX 540 mobile graphics chip By Mark Coppock — April 19, 2017 11:40 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you AMD's newest mobile graphics option is looking like a decidedly entry-level offering. The Radeon RX 540 will apparently offer better-than-integrated graphics performance and not much more. AMD recently announced another line of desktop graphics cards based on its Polaris GPU architecture, specifically the Radeon 500 series that ranges from the Radeon RX 550 up to the RX 580. Not all of the details have been released yet, but speculation was that AMD would also release a 500 series GPU for the mobile market. AMD has now published a product page for its newest mobile graphics option, and it’s looking like a decidedly entry-level offering. The Radeon RX 540 appears likely to be the mobile version of the RX 550, and will offer better-than-integrated graphics performance and not much more, according to The Tech Report. The chip that AMD is using in both the RX 550 desktop card and the RX 540 mobile version is a small one at 101 mm², and as The Tech Report describes, it’s “exactly half of a full Polaris 11 in some ways.” That means the RX 540 will likely serve as AMD’s budget notebook option going forward and will mostly compete with Intel’s integrated graphics and Nvidia’s low-end mobile options. In terms of specifications, the Radeon RX 540 will support up to 4GB of GDDR5 memory running on a 128-bit interface and provide up to 96GB/s bandwidth. The chip will offer eight compute units and 512 stream processors, up to 1219MHz frequency, and 16 ROPs. It will also likely be a very low-power chip, drawing something less than the 50 watts required by the RX 550. Overall performance is rated at 1.2 TFLOPS, 39 Gtexels/s, and 19.5 Gpixels/s. Of course, the Radeon RX 540 will support all of AMD’s most important technologies, including Radeon Chill and ReLive, FreeSync, and Eyefinity. It will also provide HDMI 4K support, 4K H264 Decode and Encode, and H265/HEVC Decode and Encode. Operating system support will include Windows 7 and 10 32-bit and 64-bit, Linux x86_64, and Ubuntu X86 64-bit. According to AMD’s product page, the Radeon RX 540 has already launched. The company hasn’t indicated which notebook original equipment manufacturers will be utilizing the chip, but given its overall performance, its most likely competitor will be the Nvidia GTX 940MX that’s made its way into a number of machines as an alternative to integrated graphics.

Google Intelligent Machines Google’s New Chip Is a Stepping Stone to Quantum Computing Supremacy The search giant plans to reach a milestone in computing history before the year is out. by Tom Simonite April 21, 2017 John Martinis has given himself just a few months to reach a milestone in the history of computing. He’s leader of the Google research group working on building astonishingly powerful computer chips that manipulate data using the quirks of quantum physics. By the end of this year, Martinis says, his team will build a device that achieves “quantum supremacy,” meaning it can perform a particular calculation that’s beyond the reach of any conventional computer. Proof will come from a kind of drag race between Google’s chip and one of the world’s largest supercomputers. “We think we’re ready to do this experiment. It’s something we can do now,” says Martinis. One reason for his confidence is that Google’s roughly 25-strong group has made a new quantum chip that tests out key design features needed to make a device for that head-to-head contest. Quantum chips represent digital bits of data using qubits, devices that can shortcut through some tough calculations by exploiting the counterintuitive physics of quantum mechanics. Researchers have so far demonstrated quantum computing with only small groups of qubits, though. Google has released results from a chip that has nine qubits arranged in a line, but Martinis says he’ll need a grid of 49 qubits for his quantum supremacy experiment. Google’s latest chip has only six qubits, but they are arranged in a two-by-three configuration that Martinis says shows the company’s technology still works when qubits are nestled side by side, as they will be in larger devices. Google’s chip ready for testing. Google The six-qubit chip is also a test of a manufacturing method in which the qubits and the conventional wiring that controls them are made on separate chips later “bump bonded” together. That approach, a major focus of Google’s team since it was established just over two years ago, is intended to eliminate the extra control lines needed in a larger chip, which can interfere with how qubits function. “That process is all working,” says Martinis. “Now we’re ready to kind of move fast.” Designs for devices with 30 to 50 qubits are already in progress, he says. He briefly flashed up images of the six-qubit chip at the recent IEEE TechIgnite conference in San Bruno, California, but his group has yet to formally disclose technical details. Martinis joined Google in late 2014 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he remains a professor today (see “Google Launches Effort to Build Its Own Quantum Computer”). His team is one of several industrial research groups recently formed or expanded thanks to growing signs that the technology behind quantum computing is becoming more tractable. The race to develop quantum processors includes Intel, Microsoft, IBM, and even startups (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2017: Practical Quantum Computers”).

Pulling off its quantum supremacy experiment this year would underline the search company’s competitiveness, although quantum processors would need to be much larger than 50 qubits to be capable of useful work. “It’ll be an academic milestone,” says Chris Monroe, a professor at the University of Maryland and cofounder of the quantum computing startup IonQ. “Afterward you still have to figure out how to make it more scalable and programmable.” Martinis agrees that much will remain to be done, but he argues that the experiment could become a benchmark for anyone claiming to have a working quantum computer. He also says the target has helped managers at Google, and the company’s cofounder Sergey Brin, appreciate that the technology is becoming real. “They all get it and are very excited about it,” says Martinis. “We’re trying to get support within Google, and this experiment has been very good to get other engineers talking to us.” Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Laptop / Mobile / Samsung begins assault on Microsoft Surface, begins pre-orders for Galaxy Book Samsung begins assault on Microsoft Surface, begins pre-orders for Galaxy Book Paul Taylor 13 hours ago Laptop / Mobile A couple of months have passed since Samsung announced its intent to field a lightweight laptop under the Galaxy brand, the Samsung Galaxy Book, and the company has begun delivering on its promise. If you are in the US, April 21st is the first day the devices are available for Pre-order. The Galaxy Book is a 2-in-1 device, similar to the Microsoft Surface in design, but with a lower price tag. It is not, however, powered by any ARM processor nor does it use anything other OS than your standard Windows 10 Home edition (Windows 10 Cloud is reportedly exclusive to Qualcomm Snapdragon) and Samsung seems to be left out in the rain by the Qualcomm-Microsoft partnership, restricting it to using Intel’s Core m3 or low-power Core i5 processors. The device comes in 10.6″ (1920×1080) or 12″ (2560×1440) form factors. LTE connectivity is available on the 12″ model only. The Galaxy Book also comes with the Note-famous S Pen, and contains a nice bit of software which will sync up your Galaxy smartphone with your Galaxy Book, Samsung Flow. You can find full specs for the devices, below.

KitGuru Says: Samsung looks like it’s piggybacking on the momentum created by Surface and Microsoft’s own initiatives in developing lightweight computing devices with Windows compatibility. However, this family of devices doesn’t seem to harbour anything particularly Galaxy-y to support the name.

California’s Great America Purchases 100% Renewable Energy from Silicon Valley Power to Cover Electricity Use Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 21, 2017 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Silicon Valley Power (SVP) is pleased to announce that California’s Great America, Santa Clara’s 100-acre amusement park, will cover 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy through SVP’s Santa Clara Green Power program. Santa Clara Green Power is a renewable energy program that allows Santa Clara residents and businesses to purchase 100% solar and wind energy. Great America’s commitment to 100% wind energy – 12,810 megawatt-hours (MWhs) annually – makes it one of the largest renewable energy purchasers in the Santa Clara Green Power program and a member of the U.S. EPA’s Green Power Partnership’s Leadership Club. This annual clean energy purchase is similar to the output of four large-scale wind turbines – reducing Great America’s carbon footprint from electricity use by over 7 million pounds of carbon dioxide each year. “We are thrilled about Great America’s participation in Santa Clara Green Power,” said Larry Owens, SVP Senior Division Manager of Customer Services. “Their renewable energy commitment will place them among the top echelon of Silicon Valley’s environmental leaders and make it the first Northern California amusement park of its kind to choose 100% renewable energy.” This commitment to wind energy through SVP’s local utility program was an obvious step for Great America, which values strengthening the community in which it does business. “California’s Great America is proud to partner with Silicon Valley Power and is committed to doing its part to better the environment,” said California’s Great America Vice President & General Manager Raul Rehnborg. “It is important for us to reduce our carbon footprint and join the growing number of local businesses that embrace the importance of renewable energy.” Great America joins the increasing circle of large businesses in Santa Clara that support renewable energy, including the City of Santa Clara, Intel, Applied Materials and Santa Clara University. In addition, more than 70 small businesses and 4,000 households have committed to purchasing 100% renewable energy through Santa Clara Green Power.

Credit: REUTERS/Bogdan Cristel Related Top 30 free apps for Windows 10 Review: Microsoft Office 365 vs. Google Apps 5 fatal flaws that dog the new Windows 10 Video The top 5 features of Windows 10 Microsoft announced it intends to stick to a twice-per-year cadence of major releases for Windows 10 and Office. Along with that, it has updated the Office Online Server for data centers. Office Online Server basically lets companies deliver Office Online to their users from their data centers rather than over the internet and from Microsoft’s servers. Microsoft introduced the Office Online Server (OOS) as a successor to Office Web Apps Server 2013. + Also on Network World: Microsoft ends updates for Windows 7/8.1 on new processors + Office Online is not the same as Office 365. There are differences in the apps, although the core remains the same. One thing different is that Office Online doesn’t use the ribbon in some apps. But the basics—Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote—are all there. Outlook is available only through Outlook.com. This is the second major update to the Office Online Server with improvements across the board, such as: Performance improvements to co-authoring in PowerPoint Online Equation viewing in Word Online New navigation pane in Word Online Improved undo/redo in Word Online Enhanced W3C accessibility support for users who rely on assistive technologies Accessibility checkers for all applications to ensure that all Office documents can be read and authored by people with different abilities Office Online is available from the Volume License Servicing Center. Microsoft said that from now on, it will release an update to the server every four months to deliver more value to the users. Microsoft Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus to get regular updates  Other Microsoft products getting regular updates are Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus and System Center Configuration Manager. The company made the announcement via a blog post that it would release major updates to the three products twice per year going forward. The next Windows 10 feature update, known by the codename Redstone 3, is targeted for September 2017. Each Windows 10 feature release will be serviced and supported for 18 months, which is why Microsoft announced the end of support for the original release of Windows 10. Time to get those machines upgraded. Keeping a promised cadence can be a challenge, as Intel learned with its tick/tock strategy. Then again, Intel was fighting the laws of physics, something Microsoft is not doing. Thus far, Microsoft has done a decent job keeping major releases on schedule for Windows 10, jettisoning features if they can’t get them done on time rather than delaying the release. So, they will likely stick to this schedule. At least for the time being. Join the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.

Is it the best turn-key storage solution? Let's check it out. By: Tyler Bernath | SOHO NAS/DAS in Storage | Posted: 14 hours, 10 mins ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 89%Manufacturer: Promise   In our last review of the Pegasus 2, I came away happy with that storage solution and today Promise is back with a turn-key solution, the Apollo Cloud.   It certainly isn't hard to chew up tons of storage capacity with today's smartphones shooting high-resolution photos and 4K video. To combat this, many NAS vendors have been offering solutions to this by adding Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive to their app packages.   Promise has taken a different route making their entire platform focused on the cloud offering storage for all your devices. The Promise Apollo Cloud is a single bay 2TB solution backed by a single gigabit Ethernet connection. Through the app available on nearly every platform, you have access to all your stored media anywhere in the world.     With that said, the Promise Apollo Cloud is compatible with Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android platforms. The MSRP of the Promise Apollo cloud in the 2TB capacity comes in at $199.99 with a two-year warranty.     The Hardware     Packaging is very clean with capacity listed at the top right. An image of the device sits below with connectivity options at the bottom left.     The spine of the box has a simple specifications list. It includes the warranty at two-years and OS compatibility.     The scope of delivery included the power adapter, Ethernet cable, and a guide to help with setup.     Our first look at the Apollo Cloud shows a very sleek device with subtle branding on the front.     On the back of the device, we have a small reset button, power input and the gigabit Ethernet port coupled with USB 3.0.     Opening up the Apollo Cloud, I was surprised to see a Toshiba 2TB drive.     At the heart of the Apollo Cloud, I found the Marvell 88F6-BRT4 surrounded by RAM and flash from SKHynix.     The Software     Starting off our install, I went with the Windows utility, which starts by you needing an Apollo account for the cloud service.     During the software install, you have a few options for automatic startup.     Once inside the software, you will find a sidebar with categories. As you upload media, they will be categorized by file extension and put into these itemized lists.     In the settings menu, you get a decent amount of control over the Apollo. From here you can setup transfers via USB along with Apollo Mirror if you have two units.     Switching gears, we now go over to the iOS app.     So, once you have the app installed and you log in via the account created in the beginning, you will have a similar interface as the Windows install.     To sync or upload media from your phone, you simply click the "add content" link at the top of the app, which brings up the menu seen here.     As you can see, there are options such as TouchID built in for convenience, and you can shut down cell data, so you don't get into trouble while on the go.     Further down in the app, we have the status of the Apollo Cloud along with transfer and mirror options.       The Performance     Starting with a quick run through file sizes, the Apollo Cloud performed quite well. Read starts our at 110 MB/s and soars down while write performance started at 66 MB/s held steady through 256K and then came down.     Above, we have three real-world transfers for the Apollo Cloud. With the 200M file, this solution produced 97 MB/s read and 81 MB/s write. Moving to 800M, we grabbed 87 MB/s read and 74 MB/s write, and lastly 4000M hit 87 MB/s read and 72 MB/s write.     This last test I connected our Intel 730 SSD via USB 3.0 with 6GB of data onboard. Judging by timestamps alone, it took the Apollo Cloud 1:40 to copy that data giving us a 50-60 MB/s copy rate.     The Verdict   I enjoyed much of my time with the Apollo Cloud; it's one of those devices you kind of forget is there because of its small form factor and me being used to multiple bay appliances. It is virtually silent in operation, so that too goes far. Build quality is quite good, and Toshiba does have a rather solid reputation for their hard drives and adding to that this unit was easy to open up so replacing the drive should not be hard at all if you were to have issues.   The performance of this system was on par with expectations. I think it is held back slightly due to the hardware inside, but it did offer 97 MB/s read and 81 MB/s write, which should be plenty for most.   Each of the apps used for testing were very easy to setup; I'd say the iOS application is slightly better as far as navigation goes but uploading data is much quicker with the desktop version. Overall, as a turn-key solution, the Apollo Cloud is a solid device and offering two capacity options opens the market slightly for consumers wanting such a device.     Tyler's Test System Specifications   Motherboard: ASUS Maximus IX Hero (buy from Amazon) CPU: Intel Core i7 7700K (buy from Amazon) / (Read our Review) Memory: G.SKILL TridentZ DDR4 3200 (buy from Amazon) Video Card: EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Hybrid (buy from Amazon) OS Storage: Intel 730 480GB SSD (buy from Amazon) / (Read our Review) Secondary Storage: MyDigitalSSD BP5 512GB SSD (buy from Amazon) Case: EVGA DG-86 (buy from Amazon) Power Supply: EVGA SuperNOVA 750 P2 (buy from Amazon) Networking: ASUS PCE-AC88 AC3100 (buy from Amazon) Networking: ASUS ROG 10G Express Networking: ASUS Thunderbolt EX3 (buy from Amazon) OS: Microsoft Windows 10 (buy from Amazon) Product Summary Breakdown Performance 85% Quality 85% Features 90% Value 95% Overall TweakTown Rating 89% The Bottom Line: Promise's Apollo Cloud is a solid device, and as a turn key NAS storage solution for all your devices, a great option for consumers at a good price.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman California’s Great America Purchases 100% Renewable Energy from Silicon Valley Power to Cover Electricity Use SANTA CLARA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Silicon Valley Power (SVP) is pleased to announce that California’s Great America, Santa Clara’s 100-acre amusement park, will cover 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy through SVP’s Santa Clara Green Power program. Santa Clara Green Power is a renewable energy program that allows Santa Clara residents and businesses to purchase 100% solar and wind energy. Great America’s commitment to 100% wind energy – 12,810 megawatt-hours (MWhs) annually – makes it one of the largest renewable energy purchasers in the Santa Clara Green Power program and a member of the U.S. EPA’s Green Power Partnership’s Leadership Club. This annual clean energy purchase is similar to the output of four large-scale wind turbines – reducing Great America’s carbon footprint from electricity use by over 7 million pounds of carbon dioxide each year. “We are thrilled about Great America’s participation in Santa Clara Green Power,” said Larry Owens, SVP Senior Division Manager of Customer Services. “Their renewable energy commitment will place them among the top echelon of Silicon Valley’s environmental leaders and make it the first Northern California amusement park of its kind to choose 100% renewable energy.” This commitment to wind energy through SVP’s local utility program was an obvious step for Great America, which values strengthening the community in which it does business. “California’s Great America is proud to partner with Silicon Valley Power and is committed to doing its part to better the environment,” said California’s Great America Vice President & General Manager Raul Rehnborg. “It is important for us to reduce our carbon footprint and join the growing number of local businesses that embrace the importance of renewable energy.” Great America joins the increasing circle of large businesses in Santa Clara that support renewable energy, including the City of Santa Clara, Intel, Applied Materials and Santa Clara University. In addition, more than 70 small businesses and 4,000 households have committed to purchasing 100% renewable energy through Santa Clara Green Power. (Photos here) About California’s Great America California’s Great America is owned and operated by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, a publicly traded partnership that is listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FUN.” Great America is a 100-acre amusement park located in Santa Clara that features something for everyone, including thrilling roller coasters, family rides, Boomerang Bay Water Park, exciting shows, incredible food and much more. The park season extends through the summer and into fall and winter with Halloween Haunt and WinterFest. About Silicon Valley Power Santa Clara Green Power is the voluntary renewable energy program offered by Silicon Valley Power, in partnership with 3Degrees, to all customers for energy generated from 100 percent clean wind and solar power. Customers can enroll in Santa Clara Green Power on the secure website at www.siliconvalleypower.com/green or by calling (408) 244-SAVE (7283).

It was December 2016 when Qualcomm announced real Windows for ARM. It held the promise of a fully functional Windows 10 experience running on a new ARM-based Snapdragon 835 processor, and we were told to expect its arrival in the second half of 2017. Now, however, that's been pushed to the fourth quarter, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said during an investor's call yesterday. The reason, as reported by CIO, is the availability of the Snapdragon 835 processor suitable for "mobile PC designs running Windows 10." It won't be ready until the fourth quarter, meaning no hardware can use it until then. When we do finally get these new machines, they are likely to be a mix of thin and light laptops and tablets. Expect full Windows 10 functionality and app support combined with long battery life in highly portable devices. If you need more performance, Intel and AMD will continue to be the better option, at least, for the foreseeable future. Related Qualcomm Gives Full Snapdragon 835 Processor Details Qualcomm Gives Full Snapdragon 835 Processor Details Many will be intrigued to see how these ARM-powered Windows computers perform considering they will rely heavily on emulation. Any Win32 application will run using emulation, which inevitably comes with a performance hit. However, as the video above suggests, Qualcomm and Microsoft believe this will be a smooth experience even for games and that most resource-hungry of applications: Photoshop. With the Qualcomm chips not arriving until Q4 we could actually be left waiting until early 2018 for the first machines to appear on store shelves. It all depends on whether the Snapdragon 835 appears in October rather than December.
