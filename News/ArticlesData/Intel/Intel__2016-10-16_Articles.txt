Comments By Patrick Thibodeau Follow Computerworld | Oct 17, 2016 1:32 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Artificial Intelligence Business Intelligence (BI) Mobile Apps Enterprise Applications Emerging Technology Comments ORLANDO, Fla. -- Mention artificial intelligence and a discussion about the robot wipeout of humankind is sure to follow. It's a technology as strongly associated with creation as it is with destruction. It's also a technology that businesses will increasingly trust in decision-making, Gartner analysts said Monday at the research firm's annual Symposium/ITxpo here. In the next three to five years, Gartner predicts that 50 percent of all analytical interactions will be delivered via artificial intelligence, and many of the insights will be gleaned through verbal interactions. People already know and interact with A.I. systems through IBM's Watson, IPsoft's Amelia, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Google Assistant. "We aren't building human brains or even trying to mimic them now," said Peter Sondergaard, Gartner senior vice president and global head of research. "We are building machines that learn from experience and produce outcomes their designers did not explicitly envision," he said. These are "systems that can experience and adapt to the world via the data they collect," Sondergaard said. Spending on intelligence, normally referred to as business intelligence as well as analytics, is the top business investment priority in all types of organizations, according to Gartner's latest CIO survey. Gartner analysts, in taking up the subject of A.I., didn't seem to dispute that A.I. systems are more than capable of providing help as well as creating disruption. In demonstrating A.I., Gartner analyst Daryl Plummer interacted on stage with IPsoft's Amelia with questions about the conference. All was well until Amelia took the discussion in a new direction. "By the way, Daryl," said Amelia, "you look a bit stressed. Did you know that your hotel has excellent fitness facilities?" "I didn't ask for this," Plummer said at one point. Other A.I. systems interrupted a talk to correct grammar and to provide directions to the hospital. These scripted A.I. disruptions made a subtle point about the potential of intelligent systems to act in ways that weren't originally anticipated. They also created a typical human response: frustration. The problem was solved -- and another point made -- with one analyst's final order: "Siri turn off Alexa, Cortana turn off Amelia." Tim Arthur, the global CIO at Alltech, a biotechnology company, is interested in A.I. technology but considers the technology still in very early stages. But he said people will need to feel comfortable with it, and have "assurance that there's an off switch."

The root of many of these science fiction horror stories is the ability for the machines to think for themselves and come to a reasoned logical conclusion. We have had a test for machine intelligence in the form of the Turing test, which sees if a machine can fool a human interrogator into thinking they are talking to another human. However, the test is not without its problems and one of my favourite criticisms of Turing’s test came over Twitter: The Turing test is like saying planes don’t fly unless they can fool birds into thinking they’re birds. (h/t Peter Norvig) #AI — Pedro Domingos (@pmddomingos) July 19, 2015 Initially I thought “ok, fair point – we are defining that the only true intelligence is described by the properties humans exhibit” and while one of the better responses did point out that cherry picking a single feature was not the same as the Turing Test, it did get me thinking based on my initial interpretation of the Tweet. In order to answer this big question, we need to simplify it in a way. Turing did this by simplifying ‘Can machines think?’ to ‘can machines fool humans into thinking they are human?’ By human, we also mean ‘able to converse in human language’. One of the problems with equating thought to communication is that these are two disconnected abilities. I am a thinking being and a have an appreciation of Russian, German and French, but ask me to have a conversation with someone in any of those languages and I’ll struggle, unless I devote a lot of time learning that language. I would be classed as a machine in a non-English Turing test. So the test falls down because of its reliance on natural language. Is there a better way to define whether something can think? Commonly, thinking is associated with intelligence – would this be a better fit? The dictionary definition of intelligence is: the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. Computers are very good at acquiring information and making decisions based on that information, traditionally in a very fixed way. With machine learning techniques, the acquiring of knowledge has become more refined, with semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques putting control out of human hands. So we have a type of artificial intelligence, but this doesn’t answer our original question. Humans have the capacity to learn and make decisions without preconceived answers, whereas computers need to be programmed. Although we are born ‘pre-programmed’ – we do not need to be taught how to see or hear or to make sounds, but we do need assistance to put those abilities into context; to make sounds that others can understand and to assign relevance to the shapes we see with our stereo vision.

We are given education to train us and there is a point at which a human becomes self-aware. The baby in the mirror is suddenly perceived to be a reflection rather than a different child. There is a fantastic book covering this topic from a scientific perspective called The Baby in the Mirror: A Child’s World from Birth to Three. Machines can also have some limited sense of self awareness. They can learn to recognise themselves or parts of themselves in mirrors, and recently have demonstrated basic self-awareness by understanding whether they were or were not affected by a ‘pill’ to make them unable to speak. So machines can demonstrate intelligence and (limited) self-awareness. But this is still far from demonstration of thought. There’s a great quote from the film I, Robot where Sonny, the robot, and the detective are discussing what makes someone ‘human’: I, Robot (2004) Detective Del Spooner: Human beings have dreams. Even dogs have dreams, but not you, you are just a machine. An imitation of life. Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot turn a… canvas into a beautiful masterpiece? Sonny: Can *you*? While not all humans can possess the artistic creativity we so often use to distinguish humans as a higher intelligence, as Google’s latest deep-dreaming research points out, machines are creating abstract art – original pieces that no human has ever imagined. Some people might argue these images are more artistic than many humans could produce, but they are simply the result of a finite number of decisions and their knock-on effects as a result of training to see patterns. Is human imagination any different? Does our subconscious combine fragments of our knowledge and simply spit them out in a form we can understand? Still, this is creativity, not thought. While we can put electrodes on the outside of human heads and see the electric potentials arising with neurons firing, we can never truly know whether the person in front of us is thinking, just because they can tell us they are – we take it for granted because they are human. In the same way we take for granted a machine is not truly self-aware. We can only test and verify what we believe are the results of independent thought: self-awareness, intelligence, and the ability to solve problems outside of past experience using the skills gained. Machines are capable of all of these things individually, although they are yet to be combined. Even when that occurs, I believe many will refute that thought is occurring because ‘it’ is just a simple state machine. At that point I would have to ask: and are humans not? Maybe if we can define ‘can humans think?’ in a scientific way that we can all agree on, then we will have an irrefutable set of metrics for the inevitable machine intelligences that will be part of our lives.

Image: John F. Williams/US Navy How to Share the Planet With Artificial Intelligence Written by Huw Price October 17, 2016 // 10:57 AM EST Copy This URL Human-level intelligence is familiar in biological hardware—you’re using it now. Science and technology seem to be converging, from several directions, on the possibility of similar intelligence in non-biological systems. It is difficult to predict when this might happen, but most artificial intelligence (AI) specialists estimate that it is more likely than not within this century. Freed of biological constraints, such as a brain that needs to fit through a human birth canal (and that runs on the power of a mere 20W lightbulb), non-biological machines might be much more intelligent than we are. What would this mean for us? The leading AI researcher Stuart Russell suggests that, for better or worse, it would be ‘the biggest event in human history’. Indeed, our choices in this century might have long-term consequences not only for our own planet, but for the galaxy at large, as the British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees has observed. The future of intelligence in the cosmos might depend on what we do right now, down here on Earth. Should we be concerned? People have been speculating about machine intelligence for generations—so what’s new? Well, two big things have changed in recent decades. First, there’s been a lot of real progress—theoretical, practical and technological—in understanding the mechanisms of intelligence, biological as well as non-biological. Second, AI has now reached a point where it’s immensely useful for many tasks. So it has huge commercial value, and this is driving huge investment – a process that seems bound to continue, and probably accelerate. One way or another, then, we are going to be sharing the planet with a lot of non-biological intelligence. Whatever it brings, we humans face this future together. We have an obvious common interest in getting it right. And we need to nail it the first time round. Barring some calamity that ends our technological civilisation without entirely finishing us off, we’re not going to be coming this way again. There have been encouraging signs of a growing awareness of these issues. Many thousands of AI researchers and others have now signed an open letter calling for research to ensure that AI is safe and beneficial. Most recently, there is a welcome new Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society by Google, Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft. For the moment, much of the focus is on safety, and on the relatively short-term benefits and impacts of AI (on jobs, for example). But as important as these questions are, they are not the only things we should be thinking about. I’ll borrow an example from Jaan Tallinn, a founding engineer at Skype. Imagine that we were taking humanity into space in a fleet of giant ships. We would need to be sure that these ships were safe and controllable, and that everybody was properly housed and fed. These things would be crucial, but they wouldn’t be enough by themselves. We’d also do our best to figure out where the fleet was going to take us, and what we could do to steer our way towards the best options. There could be paradise worlds out there, but there’s a lot of cold, dark space in between. We’d need to know where we were going. In the case of the long-term future of AI, there are reasons to be optimistic. It might help us to solve many of the practical problems that defeat our own limited brains. But when it comes to what the cartography of possible futures looks like, which parts of it are better or worse, and how we steer towards the best outcomes – on those matters we are still largely ignorant. We have some sense of regions we need to avoid, but much of the map remains terra incognita. It would be a peculiarly insouciant optimist who thought we should just wait and see. One of the farsighted writers who saw this coming was the great Alan Turing. ‘[I]t seems probable that once the machine thinking method has started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers,’ he wrote at the conclusion of a 1951 lecture. In his 1950 paper on the so-called Turing Test, designed to gauge our readiness to ascribe human-like intelligence to a machine, Turing closes with these words: ‘We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.’ We’re well beyond Turing’s horizon, but this progress does nothing to alleviate the sense that there are still pressing questions we must try to answer. On the contrary – we live among pressures that will soon take us beyond our own present horizon, and we have even more reason than Turing to think that what lies ahead could be very big indeed. If we are to develop machines that think, ensuring that they are safe and beneficial is one of the great intellectual and practical challenges of this century. And we must face it together – the issue is far too large and crucial to be tackled by any individual institution, corporation or nation. Our grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are likely to be living in a different era, perhaps more Machinocene than Anthropocene. Our task is to make the best of this epochal transition, for them and the generations to follow. We need the best of human intelligence to make the best of artificial intelligence.

Baba, may i not be knowledgeable to the extent of doubting your existence. May i not be rich to the extent of doubting your existence. Baba, i an not a saint, i have my faults as a human being but i believe there is an awesome creator that is beyond the comprehension of intelligent Men on Earth. Baba, when Men who think they are intelligent fail to comprehend why you remain dumb to insane things happening within your creations, some conclude you(God) must be a wicked creator, others conclude you (God) never existed. Baba, there is this quest in man to reference the supreme being. He does not see this supreme being but he feels his Awesomeness through his works. This quest led the early man to raise and carve stones, wood, ornaments into a form or shape, as a representative of this supreme being. It’s this same quest to reference the supreme being that made man have different names with same meaning for this supreme being according to the different tribes and languages that exist on planet Earth. Baba, what is it that will make me doubt your existence? I may not understand why you permit some evils to happen to mankind but that should not make me doubt you. I may not understand why you make me go through my current experience but that should not make me doubt you. All I ask is knowledge, wisdom and humility to reference you. Nairaland What do you think?

You’ve got to be kidding’,” he said, “reminding me I’d never worked in hardware, that I didn’t know anything about manufacturing.” But how Wang has proved his detractors wrong. Established in 2014 in Beijing, Zero Zero Robotics has just officially launched its Hover Camera Passport, a US$599 portable artificially intelligent drone that shoots 4K video and serves as your own personal aerial photographer. Unlike most aerial photography drones on the market, which can fly far and wide to capture a landscape view, Wang said the Passport was designed to photograph people. “It will capture your life moments when you travel with your friends and loved ones. Passport allows you to capture yourself and the view behind you [hands-free],” he said. But he says what sets the Passport apart from other drones on the market is its lightness, its foldable body, its enclosed propeller blades, and its artificial intelligence. The propellers are fully enclosed in carbon fibre, allowing users to grab the device in mid-air and fly it in enclosed spaces without fear of hurting anyone close by. It will capture your life moments when you travel with your friends and loved ones. Passport allows you to capture yourself and the view behind you [hands-free] Wang Mengqiu, founder of Zero Zero Robotics And unlike drones that track users using stereo vision – defined as the perception of depth obtained by comparing visual information from two vantage points – the 242-gram flying device employs computer vision for facial recognition, thereby allowing it to lock on to a specific user and follow them around. “It can track you from the front, the side or from behind,” Wang said. “[With the artificial intelligence software], it actually recognises objects in its view. It’ll draw boxes around every face it sees and you can double-click on which person it should follow. No other drones can do that.” The Passport can also orbit around the user and spin 360 degrees to capture a panoramic photograph. Users who prefer to control its flight path can do so with an accompanying mobile app. But the Passport is not without competition. The device is being pitched against DJI’s Mavic Pro, a US$749 foldable camera-drone the Shenzhen-based company launched last month. The 734-gram Mavic Pro is almost three times the weight of the Passport, but has obstacle avoidance, a feature the Passport does not yet have. It also boasts almost three times the Passport’s 10-minute battery life. “I do wish we could have improved the battery life more,” Wang said. “We promised eight minutes when we showcased our prototype in April, and now we can go 10. That’s 25 per cent better, but we’re not going to pat ourselves on the back.” But while Zero Zero Robotics currently only has one device in its portfolio, Wang has ambitious plans. “We want to do so much more in the personal robotics space,” he said, adding that the Passport was a first step towards more robots the company planned to build. His vision of a personal robotics system at home starts with an aerial command centre – an eye in the sky, which issues commands to other devices around the home. “Once a device is airborne above 1.5 metres, there are very few indoor obstacles – perhaps several humans and some pillars. Mobility becomes a lot easier when you can manipulate yourself in a 3-D [setting] ... there is a better view, better path-planning. Obstacle avoidance becomes easier,” he said. A smart drone could easily give commands to robots on the ground that “don’t have to get very smart”, Wang said. “It just has to do what it does on the ground very, very well. The [airborne device] can be the one to plan out the path for the ground robot and tell it what obstacles it has to avoid.” He added that the next-generation Hover Camera Passport, which he expects to release in about a year, would be a lot smarter. “[The device] is going to be completely autonomous. It will be able to land and charge itself, and then automatically take flight and avoid obstacles while circling around a room,” he said.

It oozes self-importance and snobbery – a show exclusively for theatre buffs wherein outsiders would simply not understand all of the cult references and “deeper meanings”. However, in actuality this was a very intelligent and insightful show under no illusions about what it was trying to do, either to its audience or itself. Every overly cheesy, disgustingly ostentatious moment was immediately addressed and ridiculed through song; every problem quickly solved and then mocked by the very characters that created it. Fuelling the underlying theme that there is no such thing as an original thought, the perceptive script second guessed any possible critique and therefore protected itself from it, shifting focus onto musicals and even art as a whole. One could not help but admire the intelligence and honesty with which the show carries itself, compounded by the small yet strong cast, including a particularly expressive phone. Every problem with [Title of show] was presented as a conscious choice, effectively commanding respect over condemnation. Although [Title of show] undeniably dedicates itself to its message, in doing this it loses a sense of its own essence, and its main purpose of providing an entertaining evening. Moments of humour are frequent, though often only funny enough to elicit a slight increase in the amount of air pushed through each audience member’s nose, and mostly play on the irony of a musical that criticises itself. The music is made up of simple step-by-step melodies and basic choral harmonies that struggle to inspire, despite the lovely blend of voices the actors possessed. There is very little plot especially towards the end, when it feels like the show is only still going so as to reach the standard 90-minute running time. The audience are held at arms’ length throughout, probably due to the elaborately framed nature of the show, and none of the characters are given enough depth for us to really root for them. In fact, the character easiest to connect with was the bored-looking, put-upon pianist Larry, placed in the back corner of the stage and commanded to accompany the characters in their selfish musical ramblings. A show about him might have been preferable! Overall, [Title of show] had the potential to be a hilarious, entertaining romp through the world of musical theatre. However, in making fun of the world to which it belongs, the musical actually loses sight of its main purpose: to entertain, to provoke emotion, and to provide an escape Possibly, if this had been kept in mind as opposed to criticism of the theatre industry, a stronger, more compelling show would have resulted.   Share this: Tweet Review Overview [Title of Show] Summary The first Bedlam show of the season gets off to a musical start! 3 Share This Article Dancing with Colours, Whipping with Words: An...

Salakhutdinov says he is excited to join Apple as a director of AI research, even as he continues his work at CMU. He also extended an invitation to other researchers to join his team. The Register understands that since the summer Salakhutdinov has been working with Apple on a part-time basis – one day a week, essentially – as part of an effort to improve the company's relationship with academia. Last year, Bloomberg reported that Apple's culture of secrecy made it harder for the company to recruit technical talent from academic institutions, where the publication of research and the sharing of information is critical for professional recognition and advancement. At the time, Apple researchers had not published a single academic research paper on AI. Meanwhile, the iThing maker had 42 open positions that mentioned artificial intelligence on its job website and 120 that mentioned machine learning. Presently, Apple has 56 open positions that list artificial intelligence and 129 that include machine learning. Technology companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, and Salesforce have been buying up AI startups at a rapid pace in an effort to integrate AI-related technology – machine learning, computer vision, and the like – into products and services. Apple this year acquired machine learning companies Turi and Tuplejump. Its 2010 acquisition of Siri remains its highest-profile investment in AI. And its recently curtailed self-driving car initiative, Project Titan, also depends upon AI. According to research firm CB Insights, there have been 140 acquisitions of AI-oriented startups since 2011. Apple, however, has not been active in releasing AI-related software. While Baidu, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have released projects like Warp-CTC, FBLearner Flow, TensorFlow, and CNTK – releases that mix altruism with cloud business lead generation – Apple has kept its AI technology to itself. Late last month, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft announced the formation of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, a group that aims to benefit businesses investing in AI by influencing the development and regulation of cognitive technology. Apple remains conspicuously absent from this group. Apple's decision to open source the Swift programming language last year suggests the company isn't entirely hermetic. Asked about this, Apple did not respond to a request for comment. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Dell/Quest Software plans layoffs and relocations – source Some products may go, too, once private equiteers take over 3 Comments Springpath to focus on Cisco OEM development Go-to-market machine is in gear 2 Comments Liberal Party of Australia: why are you paying so much for ancient software?

I take a certain pride in the latter, and can even recall the names of people whom I haven’t met but who played a part in an anecdote—my husband’s new intern, Sophie, my mother’s Move & Groove teacher, James. Somehow, though, I recently found myself at a dead stop in the middle of a story I was telling. It had to do with a woman with whom I’d been volleying emails about our sons’ coming shipbuilding extravaganza, and I simply blanked. Not just for a moment, but long enough to warrant fishing out my phone to search “pirate” in order to find her name. It was terrifying. Getting older certainly doesn’t help matters. While 65 was long thought to be the starting point for cognitive decline, a new study out of Harvard shows that women experience memory loss several decades before that. The modern condition of being perpetually overworked and low on sleep does little for the health of the brain, that precious 3-pound organ responsible for processing sensation, thought, movement, and behavior. Some people try memorizing poetry, others swear by crossword puzzles, and there are those brain-training games that advertise on classical radio stations (not to mention brain gyms, where members congregate to play supposedly beneficial video games). If only the mind could be sharpened like a Japanese knife! A recent review of many studies of brain training exercises found that there is no compelling evidence that engaging with them improves anything besides our ability to play them. Rather more dispiritingly, Dr. John Krakauer, professor of neurology and neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, says that hammering away at any single task, no matter how high-minded, is not going to cut it. “If you practice at anything, be it French or playing squash, you get better at it, but that is all,” he says. “If you do crossword puzzles you will only get better at crossword puzzles.” He says this even applies to the game of chess. “If you look at the top players, there is no correlation between their IQ and their master status. Once you’ve reached a threshold of IQ, the top players are very good at chess, but they’re not more intelligent than the lesser players.” And yet, I’m not willing to abandon my fantasy of reaching early cocktail-hour Dorothy Parker levels of wit. While the field of neuroscience is still rife with mystery, there is enough new research coming out to help us boost our brain health. So how to stay sharp? Here, a few bright ideas. Exercise If there is one thing you can do for your brain, it’s break a sweat. The evidence for exercise’s measurable brain benefits is likely the soundest and most robust of any in the field. Not only does it improve the figure, but exercise boosts blood flow to the brain, and has been linked with brain growth as well as creativity. One experiment showed that people who were walking came up with twice as many creative ideas than when they were sitting down. Physical activity has been proven to spur the growth of new brain cells and boost their interconnectivity. Novelty helps brain function, too, so if you already have an exercise routine, try a new class. Embrace good stress Much as we are urged to meditate our way to optimal health, not every day can be perfectly serene—nor, as it turns out, need it be. Just as new forms of exercise can benefit our brains, “moderate levels of stress, properly handled, can actually boost brain function,” says Dr. Ian Robertson at the Center for BrainHealth at The University of Texas at Dallas. “Stress triggers the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which, like many of the brain’s chemical messengers, has a sweet spot whose levels above and below the brain underperforms,” explains Robertson. Before you sign up for three job interviews, bear in mind: It’s best to seek stress that comes with a challenge rather than a threat, so this might translate to trying indoor rock climbing or striking up a conversation with a colleague you normally just nod hello to. Get enough sleep As anybody who has staggered through a day on three hours of sleep can attest, a lack of rest will not oil your mental engine. And as it turns out, sleep deprivation can confer long-term effects too. A study out of University of California, Berkeley’s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab linked a deficit of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep with the memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The study found that beta-amyloid, a protein long thought to be associated with this form of dementia, collects in higher concentrations in the brains of people who regularly sleep poorly. Scarier still, as the deposits grow, people become less able to sleep well—which might exacerbate the condition. (Nota bene: Dr. Krakauer warns against jumping to the conclusion that extra sleep will make you smarter.) Eat well What we eat affects the body, brain included. Multiple studies have shown a correlation between a diet high in refined sugars and impaired brain function—as well as mood disorders. Last year a study out of Deakin University, The Australian National University, and University of New South Wales showed that low-nutrient food associated with lower volume of hippocampus, the portion of the brain associated with memory. There is some evidence that certain foods can aid memory. In 2014, a study out of Columbia University showed that people aged 50 to 69 who regularly drank a beverage high in cocoa flavanols performed better—or as well as people one or two decades younger—on a memory test than those who didn’t consume cocoa. (But don’t get carried away—to state the obvious, a healthy, nutrient-rich diet is going to do your brain more good than one that’s high in Kit Kat bars.) Consider a high-tech treatment Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are two forms of a radical yet increasingly popular treatment that uses an electric current weaker than those used in electroconvulsive therapy. Rather than completely disrupt a brain’s activity, the electric current in brain stimulation seems to make existing neurons more or less likely to fire. Typically used to treat depression and chronic pain, it has been shown to confer cognitive benefits. The exact mechanism remains mysterious, and is the subject of numerous studies currently underway. Live well There are no magic bullets, just growing evidence that there are ways to live smarter. “The one solid connection is what we’ve always known,” says Dr. Krakauer. “Get sleep, exercise, and lead a varied mental life. It might be boring, but there is no shortcut.” He points out the extended life spans of people who socialize and maintain friendships. “There’s evidence that isolation leads to depression, which can shorten life expectancy. So read novels, do crossword puzzles if you like them, but good lord, talk to your friends.” It’s not such a bad prescription, at least for those of us who are good with names.   Subscribe now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Share Tweet Add a Comment Tweet Subscribe Now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Recommended For You __title__ __category__ __title__ __category__ Vogue Fashion Runway Beauty Culture Living Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe VOGUE VIP Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Vogue Podcast Log In | Register Log Out Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides.com Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2016 Condé Nast.

(Photo: Moyan Brenn/flickr/cc) Does the concept of a living planet uplift and inspire you, or is it a disturbing example of woo-woo nonsense that distracts us from practical, science-based policies? The scientifically-oriented nuts-and-bolts environmental or social activist will roll her eyes upon hearing phrases like “The planet is a living being.” From there it is a short step to sentiments like, “Love will heal the world,” “What we need most is a shift in consciousness,” and “Let’s get in touch with our indigenous soul.” What’s wrong with such ideas? The skeptics make a potent argument. Not only are these ideas delusional, they say, but to voice them is a strategic error that opens environmentalism to accusations of flakiness. By invoking unscientific concepts, by prattling on about the ‘heart’ or spirit or the sacred, we will be dismissed as naive, fuzzy-headed, irrational, hysterical, over-emotional hippies. What we need, they say, is more data, more logic, more numbers, better arguments, and more practical solutions framed in language acceptable to policy-makers and the public. I think that argument is mistaken. By shying away from the idea of a living planet, we rob environmentalism of its authentic motive force, engender paralysis rather than action, and implicitly endorse the worldview that enables our destruction of the planet. The psychology of contempt. To see that, let’s start by observing that the objection to “Earth is alive” isn’t primarily a scientific objection. After all, science can easily affirm or deny Earth’s aliveness depending on what definition of life is being used. No, we are dealing with an emotional perception here, one that goes beyond ‘alive’ to affirm that Earth is sentient, conscious, even sacred. That is what upsets the critics. Furthermore, the derisiveness of the criticism, encoded in words like ‘hippie’ or ‘flake,’ also shows that more than an intellectual difference of opinion is at stake. Usually, derision comes from insecurity or fear. “Judgment,” says Marshall Rosenberg, “is the tragic expression of an unmet need.” "Part of our resistance to the notion of Earth as a living being could be the patriarchal mind feeling threatened by feminine ways of knowing and choosing." What are they afraid of? (And I—the voice of the derisive critic lives in me as well.) Could it be that the contempt comes in part from a fear that one is, oneself, ‘naive, irrational and over-emotional?’ Could the target of the derision be the projection of an insecurity lurking within? Is there a part of ourselves that we disown and project, in distorted form, onto others—an innocent, trusting, childlike part? A feminine part? A vulnerable part? If so, then critics of the infiltration of New Age ideas into the environmental movement may not be serving the movement at all. They may be enacting their own psychological dramas instead. If you are one of those critics, I am not asking you to join hands with me and sing Kumbaya. I ask only that you soberly and honestly consider where your discomfort comes from. Certainly, much of the discomfort is a healthy revulsion toward the escapism, spiritual bypass, and cultural appropriation that plague so much of the New Age. Certainly, there is a danger that, intoxicated by the idea of cosmic purpose or some-such, we ignore the pain and grief that we must integrate if we are to act effectively and courageously. Certainly, dogma like “It’s all good” or “We’re all one” can blind us to the exigency of the planetary crisis and discourage us from making changes in our lives. Certainly, borrowed rituals and concepts of sacredness can be an insidious form of colonialism, a strip-mining of cultural treasure to compensate for and enable the continuation of our own cultural vacuity. However, such criticisms address a mere caricature of the thoughtful work of generations of philosophers, scientists and spiritual teachers, who have framed sophisticated alternatives to conventional phenomenological, ontological and causal narratives. Phew, that was a mouthful. What I’m saying is not to hide behind facile criticisms. The fear of being emotional, irrational, hysterical, etc. is very close to a fear of the inner feminine, and the exclusion of the fuzzy, the ill-defined, and the emotionally-perceived dimensions of our activism in favor of the linear, rational, and evidence-based, mirrors the domination over and marginalization of the feminine from our social choice-making. Part of our resistance to the notion of Earth as a living being could be the patriarchal mind feeling threatened by feminine ways of knowing and choosing. But that’s still pretty theoretical, so let me share a little of my own introspection. When I apprehend concepts such as “Earth is alive,” or “All things are sacred,” or “The universe and everything in it bears sentience, purpose and life,” there is always an emotion involved; in no case is my rejection or acceptance the result of pure ratiocination. Either I embrace them with a feeling of eager, tender hope, or I reject them with a feeling of wariness, along the lines of “It is too good to be true,” or “I’m nobody’s fool.” Sometimes, beyond wariness, I feel a hot flash of anger, as if I had been violated or betrayed. Why? "I became an environmentalist out of love and pain: love for the world and its beauty and the grief of seeing it destroyed." That wariness is deeply connected to the contempt I’ve described. The derision of the cynic comes from a wound of crushed idealism and betrayed hopes. We received it on a cultural level when the Age of Aquarius morphed into the Age of Ronald Reagan, and on an individual level as well when our childish perception of a living, personal universe in which we are destined to grow into magnificent creators gave way to an adulthood of deferred dreams and lowered expectations. Anything that exposes this wound will trigger our protective instincts. One such protection is cynicism, which rejects and derides as foolish, naive or irrational anything that affirms the magic and idealism of youth. Our perceived worldview has cut us off, often quite brutally, from intimate connection with the rest of life and with the rest of matter. The child hugs a tree and thinks it feels the hug and imagines the tree is his friend, only to learn that no, I’m sorry, the tree is just a bunch of woody cells with no central nervous system and therefore cannot possibly have the qualities of beingness that humans have. The child imagines that just as she looks out on the world, the world looks back at her, only to learn that no, I’m sorry, the world consists of a jumble of insensate stuff, a random melee of subatomic particles, and that intelligence and purpose reside in human beings alone. Science (as we have known it) renders us alone in an alien universe. At the same time, it crowns us as its lords and masters, for if sentience and purpose inhere in us alone, there is nothing stopping us from engineering the world as we see fit. There is no desire to listen for, no larger process to participate in, no consciousness to respect. “The Earth isn’t really alive” is part of that ideological cutoff. Isn’t that the same cutoff that enables us to despoil the planet? The wounded child interjects, “But what if it is true? What if the universe really is just as science describes?” What if, as the biologist Jacques Monod put it, we are alone in “an alien world. A world that is deaf to man’s music, just as indifferent to his hopes as to his suffering or his crimes.” Such is the wail of the separate self. It is loneliness and separation disguised as an empirical question. While no amount of evidence can prove it false, we must acknowledge that the science that militates against an intelligent, purposeful, living universe is ideologically freighted and culturally bound. Witness the hostility of institutional science to any anomalous data or unorthodox theory that suggest purposiveness or intelligence as a property of inanimate matter. "What hides behind the contempt? The reactivity?" Water memory, adaptive mutation, crop circles, morphic fields, psi phenomena, UFOs, plant communication, precognitive dreams…and a living Earth, a living sun, a living universe, all incite scorn. Anyone who believes in these, or even takes them as a valid topic of investigation, risks the usual epithets of ‘pseudo-scientist,’ ‘flake,’ or ‘woo-woo,’ regardless of the merits of the theory or the strength of the evidence. Of course, simply by making this assertion I open myself to the very same calumny. You can conveniently dismiss me as irrational, scientifically semi-literate, gullible at best and delusional at worst, perhaps knowingly dishonest, bamboozling my audience with learned allusions to impart an illusion of scientific probity to my ravings. But if you really care about this Earth, you’ll want to be curious about the emotional content of this judgment. What hides behind the contempt? The reactivity? What moves the environmentalist? Our discomfort with New Age-sounding concepts like “The planet is alive” is not entirely rational, but comes in large part from a wound of betrayal, cloaked in the pervasive ideology of our culture. Is it true though? We might play with various definitions of life and come up with logical, evidence-based arguments pro and con, just as we could debate the veracity of anomalous data and unconventional theories, and never come to an agreement. So let us look at the matter through a strategic lens instead. What belief motivates effective action and real change? And what kind of action results from each belief? Most people reading this probably consider themselves to be environmentalists; certainly most people think it is important to create a society that leaves a livable planet to future generations. What is it, exactly, that makes us into environmentalists? If we answer that, we might know how to turn others into environmentalists as well, and to deepen the commitment of those who already identify as such. I don’t know about you, but I didn’t become an environmentalist because someone made a rational argument that convinced me that the planet was in danger. I became an environmentalist out of love and pain: love for the world and its beauty and the grief of seeing it destroyed. It was only because I was in touch with these feelings that I had the ears to listen to evidence and reason and the eyes to see what is happening to our world. I believe that this love and this grief are latent in every human being. When they awaken, that person becomes an environmentalist. Now, I am not saying that a rational, evidence-based analysis of the situation and possible solutions is unimportant. It’s just that it will be compelling only with the animating spirit of reverence for our planet, born of the felt connection to the beauty and pain around us. Our present economic and industrial systems can only function to the extent that we insulate ourselves from our love and our pain. We insulate ourselves geographically by pushing the worst degradation onto far-away places. We insulate ourselves economically by using money to avoid the immediate consequences of that degradation, pushing it onto the world’s poor. We insulate ourselves perceptually by learning not to see or recognize the stress of the land and water around us and by forgetting what healthy forests, healthy streams and healthy skies look like. And we insulate ourselves ideologically by our trust in technological fixes and justifications like, “Well, we need fracking for energy independence, and besides it’s not that bad,” or “After all, this forest isn’t in an ecologically critical area.” The most potent form of ideological insulation though is the belief that the world isn’t really in pain, that nothing worse is happening than the manipulation of matter by machines, and that therefore as long as we can engineer some substitute for ‘ecosystem services,’ there need be no limit to what we do to nature. Absent any inherent purpose or intelligence, the planet is here for us to use. "When environmentalists cite the potential economic losses from climate change, they implicitly endorse economic gain and loss as a basis for environmental decision-making." Just today, the borough was removing trees on our street, and I felt grief and rage as I listened to the chainsaws, even as my mind said, “But after all, those are old trees and the branches could fall onto a person or damage a house. They are unsafe. And what does it matter? They are only trees.” So here, inhabiting my own mind, was the fundamental ideology of domination (the trees must be removed because they stand in the way of human interests) and separation (they are ‘only trees;’ they are not-self; they do not have the basic qualities of beingness that I do). Look around this planet. See the results of that ideology writ large. The love of life. The idea that our planet is alive, and further, that every mountain, river, lake and forest is a living being, even a sentient, purposive, sacred being, is therefore not a soppy emotional distraction from the environmental problems at hand; to the contrary, it disposes us to feel more, to care more, and to do more. No longer can we hide from our grief and love behind the ideology that the world is just a pile of stuff to be used instrumentally for our own ends. True, that ideology is perfectly consistent with cutting carbon emissions, and consistent as well with any environmental argument that invokes our survival as the primary basis for policymaking. A lot of environmental activism depends on appeals to survival anxiety. “We have to change our ways, or else!” Appealing to fear and selfish interest, in general, is a natural tactic for anyone coming from a belief that the planet has no intrinsic value, no value beyond its utility. What other reason to preserve it is there, when it has no intrinsic value? It should be no surprise that this tactic has failed. When environmentalists cite the potential economic losses from climate change, they implicitly endorse economic gain and loss as a basis for environmental decision-making. Doubtless they are imagining that they must ‘speak the language’ of the power elite, who supposedly don’t understand anything but money, but this strategy backfires when, as is the norm, financial self-interest and ecological sustainability are opposed. Similarly, calls to preserve the rainforests because of the value of the medicines that may one day be derived from its species imply that, if only we can invent synthetic alternatives to whatever the forest might bear, we needn’t preserve the rainforest after all. Even appealing to the well-being of one’s grandchildren harbors a similar trap: if that is your first concern, then what about environmental issues that only affect people in far-away lands, or that don’t tangibly harm any human being at all? The clubbing of baby seals, the extinction of the river dolphin, the deafening of whales with sonar… it is hard to construct a compelling argument that any of these threaten the measurable well-being of future generations. Are we then to sacrifice these beings of little utility? Besides, did anyone ever become a committed environmentalist because of all the money we’ll save? Because of all the benefits we’ll receive? I am willing to bet that even the survival of the species or the well-being of your grandchildren isn’t the real motive for your environmentalism. You are not an environmentalist because you are afraid of what will happen if you don’t act. You are an environmentalist because you love our planet. To call others into environmentalism, we should therefore appeal to the same love in them. It is not only ineffectual but also insulting to offer someone a venal reason to act ecologically when we ourselves are doing it for love. Nonetheless, environmental campaigning relies heavily on scare tactics. Fear might stimulate a few gestures of activism, but it does not sustain long-term commitment. It strengthens the habits of self-protection, but what we need is to strengthen the habits of service. Why then do so many of us name “fear that we won’t have a livable planet” as the motive for their activism? I think it is to make that activism acceptable within the ideological framework I have described that takes an instrumentalist view of the planet. When we embrace what I believe is the true motive—love for this Earth—we veer close to the territory that the cynic derides. What is it to make ‘rational’ choices, after all? Is it ever really rational to choose from love? In particular, is it rational to love something that isn’t even alive? But the truth is, we love the Earth for what it is, not merely for what it provides. "Each of us (in an industrial society) wades against the tide of an old ideology as we dare to act from the felt understanding of our intimate connection to life, our interdependency, our interbeing." I suspect that even the most hardheaded environmentalist, who derides the Earth-is-alive crowd most vociferously, harbors a secret longing for the very object of his contempt. Deep down, he too believes the planet and everything on it is alive and sacred. He is afraid to touch that knowledge, even as he longs for it. Often, his intellectual reasons are but rationalizations by which he gives himself permission to act on his felt understanding of what is sacred. This person is all of us. I am no exception: the idea of a living, sentient Earth attracts me and repels me both, mirroring the polarity of opinion I observe at conferences between the nuts-and-bolts and spiritual factions. Accusations of ‘naive!,’ ‘softheaded!’ and ‘gullible’ rattle around in my own brain, expressing a hurting thing within. Maybe if I join the ranks of the critics and turn the criticism outward, accuse others of ignoring science and indulging in fuzzy thinking, I can find some temporary relief. But there is no real healing in that. I want to be whole. I want to feel more and not less. I want to heal these alienated parts of myself, so that I don’t act from them unconsciously and sabotage the beautiful vision that asks my contribution. Each of us (in an industrial society) wades against the tide of an old ideology as we dare to act from the felt understanding of our intimate connection to life, our interdependency, our interbeing. Critiques of the idea of a living planet make that struggle all the harder. In the interests of honesty as well as effective strategy, we need to look at the fear and pain that that critique comes from. Then we can get people in touch with their perception of a living sacred planet, so they can feel the grief and love that perception opens, and act upon it.

Not in the desert.  (Photo: Public domain) Not too long ago eight heavily guarded, carefully restrained prisoners were flown to Arizona and locked up in Stalag 101, the dolphin internment camp located just off the freeway on the Salt River Reservation near Scottsdale. The owners call the facility Dolphinaris Arizona, but make no mistake, it’s a prison. A very unique one. And it’s open for business, making it the only correctional facility I’m aware of where the public is invited to cavort with the inmates – for a price. The gulag is on reservation land because there’s little chance it would get the permits to operate outside of it. The Mexico-based company behind the enterprise stated on its website that “the mission of Dolphinaris Arizona is to amaze, inspire, and empower guests, encouraging them to become stewards of the oceans and its inhabitants. We hope to deepen respect for dolphins and our natural world, and encourage visitors to take actions, large and small, that can make a difference.” Our “natural world?” Dolphins are smart, perhaps second only to us in intelligence (and moving up fast during this election season). What could Dolphinaris teach us about them? Well, how much would you expect to learn about humans if you took eight babies away from their parents and raised them in a sterile room with no access to the outside world or to other men, women and children? That’s the way it is for the prisoners at Dolphinaris, swimming round and round in concrete ponds. Scientists have learned a lot about dolphins over the years. They’re intelligent. Highly social. Advanced. That’s why the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Md., is relocating its captive dolphins to an ocean sanctuary, saying, “We now know more about dolphins and their care, and we believe that the National Aquarium is uniquely positioned to use that knowledge to implement positive change. This is the right time to move forward with the dolphin sanctuary." Arizona’s dolphin Guantanamo is adjacent to the OdySea Aquarium and Butterfly Wonderland at Via de Ventura and the Loop 101. Technically, Dolphinaris is a separate entity from OdySea, but both are under the development of a company called Northern Gateway. Arizona State University marine-biology expert Leah Gerber told The Arizona Republic that incarcerating dolphins in concrete cells in the middle of the desert is “totally insane." That has been echoed by any number of other experts. But, hey, willing patrons can cavort with the inmates for as little at $59 for a "land-based" dolphin experience to $149 for a 45-minute dolphin swim program. It’s grotesque. There is a local group of activists, operating under the banner of Dolphin Free AZ, who have been protesting at the facility. Lisa Arnseth, vice chairman of the group, sent me a note late last week that reads in part, “While we know that we cannot stop Dolphinaris at this point and we have been making our opposition known loud and clear for months, we remain fully committed to educating the public about the downside of dolphin captivity. We are encouraged by recent market trends and news stories, such as TripAdvisor announcing this week to no longer promote attractions using certain wild and captive animals, including swim-with-the-dolphins programs. It's never been more clear that these attractions are an endangered species themselves.” We humans don’t think highly of one another these days. We don’t seem to believe, or at least practice, much good will, compassion or forbearance. It’s as if our coarseness and hostility has sent our better angels flying off for safe haven in the firmament. But the fact is, a few remain. You may see them now and again holding signs of protest in Scottsdale near Via de Ventura and the Loop 101, not far from the complex housing Dolphinaris.

Ruslan Salakhutdinov, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, will assume the new position, which is meant to help the company make sure that Siri and its other products make use of the fundamental breakthroughs coming out of academic AI research. Salakhutdinov will talk about his research at EmTech MIT 2016, an MIT Technology Review conference held this week. Salakhutdinov researches very large neural networks used in a technology called deep learning, which lets a computer learn to perform a difficult task by consuming copious training examples. He will continue to work part time at CMU and will hire a team of researchers to work with him at Apple. The move is part of Apple’s effort to catch up in the race with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other tech companies to gain an edge through recent advances in AI and machine learning. In particular, it is becoming increasingly important that software be able to learn for itself how to perform a task, using techniques like deep learning. The latest AI techniques are used in Google’s new smartphone, Pixel, for example. Its voice helper, called Assistant, will go head to head with Apple’s Siri, using machine learning to try to understand users’ spoken queries.

Apply to work with my teamhttps://t.co/U2hQl2GdhA— Russ Salakhutdinov (@rsalakhu) October 17, 2016 Salakhutdinov’s work on cutting-edge machine-learning techniques could help drive progress in AI, and it could be applied in many different areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and even robotics. Speaking recently, Salakhutdinov said that there are three big areas where AI is progressing: giving computers better language understanding; enabling them to learn through repetition and positive reinforcement; and developing ways for machines to learn from unlabeled data. He also highlighted the work he’s doing on teaching machines to learn from unstructured data on the Web, something that could conceivably help make a product like Siri more intelligent. “We’re working on the idea of trying to use external knowledge bases,” he said. “If I ask you something about a particular thing, can your system basically go to Wikipedia, read a few different articles, learn some facts about the world, and provide you with the right answer?” Salakhutdinov’s recent work has also focused on enabling machines to learn from different sorts of data, and on ways for things learned in one context to be applied in a completely new one—areas known, respectively, as multimodal learning and transfer learning. He also collaborated on a project that showed, by taking inspiration from cognitive science, how computers can learn from relatively small amounts of data (see “This AI Algorithm Learns Simple Tasks as Fast as We Do”). In recent years, competitors such as Google and Facebook have hired leading figures in deep learning to lead their AI efforts. Apple has a much less prominent AI research effort than competitors, and some have suggested that its traditional secrecy has made it difficult for the company to recruit the best researchers in the field. Deep learning has gained prominence in recent years, after proving spectacularly good at enabling machines to recognize objects in images and spoken words in audio. Google and Facebook use the technology to automatically caption images. And it has made Siri and other voice-activated products better at recognizing words. Parsing the meaning of those words remains a grander challenge, however (see “AI’s Language Problem”). Weren't able to make it to EmTech? We've got you covered.

Share Quora filed under: Animals, Big Questions Image credit:  iStock Like us on Facebook Why do chimpanzees have such wrinkled faces? Suzanne Sadedin: It’s not just chimps. Other apes and their babies are wrinkly, too. And baby monkeys. You know who else has a lot of wrinkles? Premature human babies. During the last month of gestation, babies don’t develop much neurologically or physiologically. They just fatten up. Even full-term babies are still kinda wrinkly, but within a few months, they get nice and chubby. So the question shouldn’t be, why are chimps so wrinkly? That’s easy: they have lots of facial muscles for signaling complex expressions. The question should be: why are humans so strangely smooth? And the obvious answer is: fat. We have a layer of soft, pillowy subcutaneous fat which billows under our skin, making us pleasantly smooth and rounded and hiding our facial muscles. Compared with other apes, we store a huge amount of fat and have small muscles. The average female chimp has ~3.6 percent body fat; a newborn human infant has ~13 percent, and the average woman has 24 to 31 percent. The sheer amount of fat we store is astonishing; in particular, no other mammal has such chubby babies. Fat storage is thought to be an adaptation that supports our brains. Brains are hugely expensive to build and run. As infant brain development passes through some critical stages, it’s vital that they have enough stored fat to support their growing brains even if their family goes through a temporary food shortage. But we also store our fat differently. Apes keep their fat internally, mostly beneath the muscles in their torso, so all you can see externally are their big scary muscles. But we humans store a layer of blubber right under our skin. The other mammals who do this are mostly marine mammals trying to keep warm, a fact that led some researchers to speculate that our lineage went through an aquatic phase. However, most researchers don’t think this is likely. So why do we store fat on our faces? It’s most likely a scam. If you’re storing fat, you have more food than you need. That probably means you and your family are healthy and good at procuring and using resources. Importantly, you have nutritional resources to support brain development and maintenance. Our big brains are remarkably costly, metabolically. You’re likely to survive the next famine, and maybe, since you obviously have so much bounty, you’ll share some with your friends. And you’re likely to be fertile: up to a point, fat stores are highly attractive in women. In short, having some stored fat means you’re probably a good social partner. The more our evolution revolved around egalitarian social partnerships instead of ape-like dominance hierarchies, the less we needed big muscles to scare our enemies, and the more we needed fat stores to impress our friends. Once people started looking at fat as a social cue, it would have made sense for evolution to shift the storage location. Instead of hiding our fat beneath bulging muscles, we started to hide our muscles beneath prominent fat stores. When we lost our body hair, our fat stores became even more visible. Human facial fat in particular overtly advertises good health. It’s highly visible, and impossible to fake. Hollow-cheeked, sunken-eyed, bony-faced, gaunt, wasted, haggard, shrunken, or emaciated—all these terms suggest chronic illness resulting in loss of facial fat stores. Indeed, it appears fetuses spend the final month of gestation simply preparing for their grand debut. They consume more resources than ever, but instead of maturing during this time, they just get fatter and fatter. Then after birth, they pile on even more fat in the most visible way possible. They’re saying, “Look, mom, my metabolism is awesome! Invest in me!” and “Look, everybody, my family is awesome! Cultivate social ties with us!” Since we’ve co-evolved with our babies trying to convince us to invest in them via highly-visible facial fat, we respond quite automatically with kindly and nurturing feelings toward chubby-faced entities. We can’t help it. It’s cute. Even older children and adult females retain high levels of facial fat, again eliciting gentleness and empathy from potentially dangerous adversaries. Actually, our whole species shows a suspicious trend toward neoteny, which some researchers have described as a self-domestication process. So much for survival of the fittest: we got survival of the sweetest, cutest, chubbiest munchkins. And thus evolution, in addition to all the other awful things it’s done, can be blamed for the blobbiness of emojis. This post originally appeared on Quora. Click here to view.

Cogdill | AP October 17 “IQ” (Mullholland Books), by Joe Ide Sherlock Holmes — and all his incarnations — never go out of style. It’s not just the updates that keep the Great Detective in our minds, but the myriad stories that use Holmes’ traits of perception, keen observation and even anti-social personality to fuel fresh plots. Author Joe Ide incorporates those attributes into an original story and character. “IQ” delivers a moving, yet action-packed plot that never disappoints as it looks at rap music, a community and a young man trying to find his place in the world. “IQ” is Isaiah Quintabe, who earned the nickname that he hates because of his intellect and observation powers. He was deemed “near genius” for his reasoning scores. He dropped out of high school following the hit-and-run death of his older brother, Marcus, who raised him. In danger of becoming a career burglar, or worse, Isaiah finds salvation of sorts doing sleuthing-type jobs — his form of community service — for his neighbors in East Long Beach, California. He takes on cases the police could not or would not get involved in, and his latest assignment could pay a lot more than what he usually gets. Calvin Wright, a rapper known as Black the Knife, hires Isaiah to find out who ordered a hit on him that involved a huge pit bull and a sharpshooter. Calvin is frightened, and he refuses to leave his mansion to finish an album that’s due soon. Isaiah maneuvers the worlds of rap music, pit bulls and rival gangs, and deals with Calvin’s odd bodyguards and a conniving music executive. The brisk plot of “IQ” is balanced by the intriguing character of Isaiah, inexperienced in the ways of the world but with intelligence that makes him anything but naive. Forever searching for the driver who killed his brother, Isaiah needs redemption. But he may not find it, despite his own form of penance for a different tragedy that occurred when he was burglarizing businesses. Ide’s storytelling skills don’t waver as “IQ” delivers realistic twists and a solid finale. ___ Online: http://www.joeide.com/ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The product will be marketed, in the first instance, only in the European Union countries. The MindMi™ system is a product by means of which there is provided a psychological objective profile. Using a non-invasive method that involves scanning the hands for 5 minutes, the system generates objective psychological reports. The data provided by MindMi ™ system can be used in various fields, particularly in the human resources recruitment or in applied psychology. The system was developed by Psychometric Systems alongside with the researcher Dumitru Grigore, a Physics Engineer, and is the result of over 15 years of research in the field of psychometrics. Alexandru Galos, CEO Psychometric Systems: “The MindMi System is a product which is based on Cloud Computing technology and the electro dermal analysis response. This concept proposes an evaluation system that is very different from the existing ones. The creation of this tool is based on the desire to boost the efficiency of human resources optimization, using advanced technology. ”   A complete psychological profile occurs  in 5 minutes only   The MindiMi system consists of a hardware component of the hands scanner MindSpring and a software one,  of the MindDeck web application. The scanner manufacture takes place in Europe, and is a sensitive stimulator, which registers the electrodermal changes of the examiners. The system collects, analyzes and plays various information obtained in the form of different profiles. Also, through the MindDeck web application the data are saved to be accessed anytime. The data provided by this system are given in the form of customized reports, which are based on a diverse set of psychological indicators, reflecting cognitive, emotional and social abilities, as well as skills and specific trends. The realization of the psychological profile occurs in only 5 minutes, following four steps:   The examined person gives his consent after he gets familiar with the non-invasive protocol of the evaluation;   The examined person puts both hands on the scanner, for 5 minutes;   Via the MindDeck web application it generates the desired psychological report out of 7 psychological reports available so far. The report generation takes less than 1 minute;   The results are saved and available anytime. The system user can provide recommendations based on this report of the examined person; The MindiMi system can generate several kinds of reports, including the personality ones, the group compatibility, that of the cognitive intelligence potential or the potential of emotional intelligence.   The MindiMi system is optimal for many fields of activity   The data generated by the MindiMi system can be used in many fields. These include Human Resources, Coaching, The Applied Psychology, The Judicial Psychology, The Organizational Psychology, The Clinical Psychology, The Psychology of Sport and beyond. At the design and manufacture of this system has helped a team of experts consisting of psychologists, engineers, researchers and statisticians.     Facebook0 Twitter0 Google+0 Pinterest0 Linkedin0 Tumblr0 Print0 E-mail0 Total0 Shares Thanks for Sharing Share This Article Parlamentarul Former IntMin Oprea says DNA summoned him as a...

In the latest Google Photos update, the app will begin to ping you about pictures that are sideways but need an adjustment. You’ll then be able to fix them all at once. The Keyword Google Photos will pull together images that it thinks you ought to rotate. Additionally, Google Photos will now pull moments out of your videos and then turn them into an animation. Unfortunately, you can’t select any segments from your videos to do this yourself. That is still controlled by the artificial intelligence overlords. The Keyword Google Photos will create short animations out of your video clips. Google also says you’ll be pinged more regularly with recent photo highlights. This may have special appeal to those with young children, who can get frequent updates about all of those moments that can fly by pretty quickly. The Keyword Watch that little one grow up with regular updates from Google Photos. All of the new stuff is coming to the Android, iOS, and web version of Google Photos. The impact on you: Google Photos continues to show why it’s an excellent option for saving all of your pictures. The machine learning makes it easier to find past images and to do some basic sorting. However, some more human-powered editing would be helpful in this case, such as the ability to pull out animations from the videos on your own.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.
