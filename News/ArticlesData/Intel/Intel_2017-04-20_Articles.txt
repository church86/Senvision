The Waymo driverless car is displayed during a Google event last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world’s biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG’s Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp. acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-21. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. “Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming, and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact.  Others such as General Motors Co. are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive PLC are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp. has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc., competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house — as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology.

But this strategy was always a little riskier than many assumed, both due to how financially important Intel's PC CPU business remains and because it was unfurled just as AMD (AMD) was getting ready to launch CPUs that put it on much better footing in the high-end and mid-range segments than it has been for many years. Now it looks as if Intel is rethinking its stance a little, even if doing so will probably lead to some near-term margin pressure. Taiwan's Digitimes, which appears to have good sources at local PC contract manufacturers and motherboard makers, reported on Wednesday that Intel plans to unveil its new high-end Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X high-end CPUs -- part of a new platform called Basin Falls -- at the Computex trade show, which runs in Taipei from May 30 to June 3. Prior reports had pointed to an August launch. Digitimes also states the first CPUs based on Intel's Coffee Lake architecture, the successor to the Kaby Lake architecture launched last fall, will debut in August. It adds the Coffee Lake launch is being pulled in January 2018, but Intel previously indicated Coffee Lake would arrive by this holiday season. The report comes about six weeks after AMD launched its high-end Ryzen 7 desktop CPUs, based on its new Zen CPU core architecture. Benchmarks showed AMD's flagship Ryzen 7 1800X chip ($499 MSRP) holding its own against Intel's Core i7-6900K (based on the older Broadwell architecture, $1,089 recommended price) in many tests. The 1800X did lag the 6900K, as well as Intel's Core i7-7700K (based on Kaby Lake, $339 recommended price), in many 1080p-resolution gaming benchmarks, but was more competitive in higher-resolution gaming tests for which GPU power matters more. AMD recently followed up on the Ryzen 7 launch by rolling out its mid-range Ryzen 5 desktop CPUs. With 6 cores and the ability to handle 12 simultaneous threads, AMD's Ryzen 5 1600X ($249 MSRP) often trounces Intel's Kaby Lake-based Core i5-7600K (4 cores and threads, $242 to $243 recommended price) in productivity and content-creation benchmarks. Moreover, the Ryzen 5 line provides a level of overclocking support that Intel's mid-range offerings generally lack. 1080p gaming is again a soft spot at times, but less so when a game has been optimized for Ryzen (Ashes of the Singularity saw about a 20% performance improvement in 1800X tests after being optimized) and/or uses Microsoft's (MSFT)  DirectX 12 programming interfaces, which can take better advantage of the 1600X's extra cores. That bodes well for the competitiveness of Ryzen CPUs in general in future gaming tests, including the 16-core desktop CPU AMD reportedly plans to launch in August and the notebook processors due at some point in the second half of the year. Intel already appears to be cutting prices below "recommended" levels for some high-end desktop parts in an effort to counter AMD. And the performance gains that Basin Falls and Coffee Lake should respectively deliver over the Broadwell and Kaby Lake CPUs they'll gradually replace should give Intel a little more breathing room in the face of AMD's aggressive pricing. Microsoft could also aid Intel's efforts to fend off AMD, not to mention lift PC upgrade rates, particularly in the corporate market. Redmond has been baking features into Windows 10 that can only be leveraged by Intel CPUs based on Skylake or a newer architecture. Security and performance-optimization features were shown off in 2015, and this week Microsoft unveiled an upcoming Windows 10 feature for newer Intel-based systems that it claims can lower CPU power draw by up to 11% by limiting how much power background apps can use. But even if Intel's more aggressive PC stance pays off, there will likely be a cost attached. In February, the company forecast its PC CPU R&D spend would drop about 5% from 2015 to 2017. With the company significantly upping its data center, flash memory and IoT R&D spend over this time, and also planning to hike its capital spending this year to $12 billion (plus or minus $500 million) from a 2016 level of $9.5 billion, cuts in PC R&D, marketing and manufacturing process investments are a key part of Intel's strategy to grow profits during a time of limited top-line growth. Speeding up the Basin Falls and Coffee Lake launches will presumably require some extra R&D spend. And if Intel also speeds up the production ramp for its Cannonlake CPUs -- the first PC CPUs based on Intel's next-gen 10-nanometer manufacturing process -- to counter AMD, that will also require some extra capex. It could also ding gross margin for a while since chips based on newer manufacturing processes tend to initially have lower yields. The first Cannonlake CPUs are expected in late 2017 or early 2018. AMD is expected to rely on 14-nanometer processes for Ryzen until 2019, when 7-nanometer chips based on a new "Zen Plus" CPU core architecture are forecast to arrive. There's a lot at stake for Intel. The company's Client Computing Group (responsible for PC and mobile processors) accounted for 52% of its 2016 revenue, and together with the Data Center Group (responsible for server CPUs, among other things) produced nearly all of its 2016 operating profits. After 12 months of talking endlessly about how it's becoming a "post-PC" company, and making some splashy acquisitions to aid that transformation, Intel might finally be realizing how much it has to lose if its treats its PC business as a "legacy" operation in the face of a resurgent AMD. The solid work that AMD has done with Ryzen, together with its undercutting of Intel's high-margin products, still leaves it well-positioned to take share. But Intel -- for a price -- might be poised to limit the damage. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money. Click the "+Follow" next to my byline to this article.

Chipzilla’s standard desktop lineup has been rattled by AMD’s new chips, which offer higher core counts and better performance in many workloads for significantly less money. Intel, of course, was never going to take this lying down — and new rumors suggest the company will accelerate the launch of its Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs, pulling them forward to a June Computex unveiling as opposed to the original August timeline. Meanwhile, Intel will reportedly launch its Coffee Lake refresh in August of this year rather than waiting until January 2018. There’ve been a number of rumors about Intel’s shifting product timelines, but whether this reflects Intel’s own plans or ordinary rumormongering isn’t clear. Defining some terms may therefore be helpful. Skylake-X: Skylake-X is the ‘normal’ CPU update we’d expect Intel to launch as part of an HEDT (High End Desktop) refresh cycle. The current 6xxx HEDT chips are built on Broadwell and support the older X99 chipset, which first debuted in 2014. Skylake-X will supposedly be available in 6, 8, and 10-core flavors. Kaby Lake-X: Kaby Lake-X’s exact features and capabilities are somewhat unclear. Rumor suggests it’s a four-core CPU + integrated graphics capable of running on the X299 platform. While it’s normal for Intel to offer lower core counts as part of the HEDT product stack, this would be the first time Chipzilla has offered a quad-core with graphics and the first time it split the HEDT lineup with introductions based on two different cores. How the Kaby Lake-X would differentiate itself from the X270 variant is unknown, but rumors of a 112W TDP suggest higher CPU clock speeds at a minimum. Basin Falls: Basin Falls is (supposedly) the codename for the new X299 chipset and the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors based on it. The image below, originally by BenchLife, claims to show the standard platform — but the diagram makes the Kaby Lake-X look like a complete waste of a product, given that it’s limited to two channels of DDR4 and just 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0. Basin Falls. Image by BenchLife Coffee Lake: Coffee Lake is a refinement of Intel’s 14nm+ process (14nm++). It’s expected to deliver marginal performance improvements, possibly similar to the ones Intel gained from Kaby Lake. Practically, this would seem to point to a few percentage points more clock speed. This would likely be along the lines of a 4.4GHz base clock with a 4.6 – 4.7GHz Turbo, as opposed to a 4.2GHz base and 4.5GHz Turbo like the Core i7-7700K features. It’s also rumored Intel’s Coffee Lake chips will include more cores, giving the company a six-core ordinary desktop part for the first time ever. When you put all these rumors together, they suggest Intel will pull in its high-end launches, offer some new SKUs, and possibly push six-core chips into the desktop space. How it all fits together is something of a mystery, however — why would Intel launch six-core chips on X299, then on regular desktops two months later? Why buy a Kaby Lake-X at all? Is there some group of HEDT customers who are dying to buy Intel’s most expensive consumer platform, then equip it with a CPU with entry-level graphics and no ability to make any use of the X299’s major features over the X270 chipset? Maybe there are, or maybe these rumors are missing some details. Either way, we’ll know soon.

According to DigiTimes, the launch is being moved up because of "increasing competition from AMD's Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors." The site says Intel will release several K-series Core i3, i5, and i7 processors starting in August, along with its Z370 chipsets. Additional CPUs will come at the end of 2017 or early in 2018. Intel also plans to unveil its Basin Falls platform, with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors at Computex 2017, which takes place from May 30 to June 3, which is two months earlier than originally scheduled. Intel's Skylake-X series features 140W processors with 6, 8, and 10-core architectures, while Kaby Lake X-series features a 112W quad-core processor. Intel also plans to release a 12-core Skylake-X processor in August. Intel's Basin Falls platform could potentially be used in future Mac Pro machines and the rumored high-end server-grade iMac. Coffee Lake chips appropriate for Apple machines were originally set to launch somewhere around the second quarter of 2018, so if rumors of Intel's updated timeline are true, the launch could be moved forward to either late 2017 or early in 2018. Coffee Lake chips are manufactured on Intel's 14-nanometer process and will be the fourth processor family to use the architecture after Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake. Apple is rumored to have new machines in the works for 2017, including new iMacs, which are likely to use Kaby Lake chips.

Intel not only needs better architecture but also better fab process. AMD is using Samsung/GloFo fab that's already shipping 10nm. My experience with Skylake and Kaby Lake have been lackluster and would rather see 10nm AMD Zen in the next products I buy. Rating: 5 Votes Moonjumper 9 hours ago at 02:32 pm Intel are upping their game because of competition from AMD. Apple should be upping their game because of competition from Microsoft. We will find out later this year how much they are. iOS has competition from Android. iOS has an advantage because of developers that use Macs. iOS needs macOS. macOS currently needs Intel. Stong competition across the board means this could be the first time for a few years we see Apple pushing itself. Customers gain if others are strong, even if they don't use the other products themselves. Rating: 5 Votes bodonnell202 8 hours ago at 03:34 pm I would like to see a nicely priced quad-core Mac Mini running AMD's raven ridge APU. The desktop variant of that chip would make for a very powerful Mac Mini. It should also be used in the smaller iMacs. An unrelated point, does anyone know how Samsung/TSMC are able to supply 10nm chips to Apple this year, but Intel cannot make them in quantity yet? Do Intel have higher standards or something? I am genuinely curious, I thought Intel were best in class. Whatever the answer, it looks bad for Intel that other chip manufacturers beat them to the 10nm process. Not all 10nm processes are equal and when Intel does ship 10nm in volume it will actually be much denser than the 10nm process that Samsung is currently using. In facts Intel's current 14nm process has a similar density to the new 10nm processes that are being introduced by other manufactures this year.

Twitter Facebook OpenStack cloud deployments are up, but Intel scales back A user survey finds that OpenStack deployments are up 44 percent, but Intel has dropped its support for the OpenStack Innovation Center Paul Krill (InfoWorld) 21 April, 2017 05:06 - - - - print email Comments OpenStack Foundation is upbeat about user participation in its cloud endeavor, despite a recent cutback on the project from key sponsor Intel. The foundation said Thursday that according to OpenStack's ninth user survey, the open source cloud project had gained 44 percent more deployments and input from 22 percent more organizations than a year ago. The average age of a deployment was just 1.68 years, with 56 percent of deployments launched either this year or in 2016, and a typical deployment runs nine projects. More than 1,300 users spanning 476 cities and 78 countries participated in the latest biannual survey, which featured responses from 583 deployments logged between January 26 and March 1. [ The cloud storage security gap â and how to close it. | The InfoWorld Deep Dive: How to make document sharing really work in Office 365. ] The survey found that 32 percent of users have 10,000 employees or more, while 25 percent have fewer than 25 employees. Also, 16 percent of deployments provisioned more than a petabyte of object storage, compared to 4 percent a year ago, and 33 percent reported storing 100,000 objects or more, as opposed to just 13 percent who did so last year. The median user site, the foundation said, runs 61 to 80 percent of their infrastructure on OpenStack. At larger installations, with clouds of 1,000 cores or more, the median user runs 81 to 100 percent of their overall infrastructure on OpenStack. Containers remain the top emerging technology of interest, with 65 percent those running OpenStack services inside containers using the Docker runtime and 47 percent of those using containers to orchestrate apps using Kubernetes. But OpenStack's reported good fortunes when it comes to its user participation are overshadowed by Intel's recent decision to discontinue its participation in OpenStack Innovation Center, a joint venture with Rackspace intended to spur OpenStack adoption through platform enhancements. The company would not comment on how much money it was contributing to the project, but as a result of Intel's decision, Rackspace has eliminated 45 positions related to the effort. Still, cloud computing analyst Dana Gardner, of Interarbor Solutions, remains confident in OpenStack, saying it remains one of the best lock-in hedges for cloud computing even as it enters maturity. "OpenStack may be taken for granted by some vendors but it should remain an essential platform for enterprise cloud architects for some years to come." 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

It's called 3D XPoint (not to be confused with 3D NAND), and it's absurdly fast. A good way to think of it is as a compromise between the speed of DRAM and the capacity of traditional flash storage. Unlike RAM, 3D XPoint is non-volatile (doesn't lose what it's storing when the power is off), and it's about four times denser. It's more expensive per gigabyte than NAND flash — the current technology inside SSDs — but it's faster in nearly every possible way, especially when it comes to latency and reading / writing small bits of data. Now Intel has started shipping its first product with the new technology: the 375GB Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. It's a $1520 PCIe card, working on the same NVMe standard that's popular for traditional SSDs right now. Intel has offered a few publications a chance to check out the card, but for whatever reason it's being very secretive about its new storage baby. Reviewers like Billy Tallis from AnandTech and Paul Alcorn from Tom's Hardware had to access Intel's own servers remotely to test the card, instead of putting it inside their own computers for testing. From looking through those tests, 3D XPoint appears great in nearly every way. For the right sort of tasks that are I/O limited but don't require terabytes of storage, 3D XPoint is the new king. While it's mostly just for enterprise right now, might require some changes in software to utilize to the utmost, and won't destroy the NAND or RAM markets anytime soon, it's nice to have a new challenger on the scene.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide If You Don't Think You Need a Graphics Card, This $80 GPU Will Change Your Mind Alex CranzYesterday 10:11am Filed to: AMD Radeon RX 550 Review AMD Radeon Polaris GPUs Reviews AMD Radeon RX 550 178 9 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo For nearly a decade, common sense has dictated that most people don’t need a standalone graphics card in their computer. Gamers need them to make rich titles like Rise of the Tomb Raider hum, and some professionals, like video editors and 3D designers, need them to take the pain out of rendering huge multimedia files. For everyone else, a video card has been treated more like a luxury item than a necessary computer component. But AMD’s $80 Radeon RX 550, a graphics card that costs a little more than the brand new games you’ll render on it, is such a good value that it might make you rethink the notion that a graphics card is a splurge you should skip. Advertisement Currently available from major retailers, the $80 AMD Radeon RX 550 is intended to upgrade an old desktop or function as the centerpiece of a new super cheap PC build. Though AMD told Gizmodo there were plans for a mobile version that should appear as an option in laptops later this year. The RX 550 comes with ports for DVI, HDMI and Display Port. If you’re young, with dewy skin, zero wrinkles, and the ability to house six chili dogs in a row, then you might not remember the time when every computer, no matter how small, needed a video card. Then in 2010 Intel introduced a GPU directly integrated into the CPU that does the bulk of your computer’s work. Graphics integrated directly into the CPU meant computer manufacturers didn’t need to put a discrete graphics card in every computer, and consequently the RX 550's predecessors, the budget-friendly graphics cards of yore, basically died. The market today is dominated by powerful cards destined for demanding applications. Advertisement AMD confused some people Monday when it announced a new series of graphics cards based on its year-old Polaris microarchitecture. You see, back at CES in January, AMD announced a new, faster architecture known as Vega. Generally graphics card makers quickly retire the old architecture when the new one arrives. So, with Vega cards expected around E3 in June, AMD’s decision to potentially cannibalize those sales with some cheap Polaris cards seems silly. Besides the newly introduced RX 580, RX 570, and the RX 560—cards that replace last year’s RX 400 series, AMD announced the RX 550. It’s a card with no equal—While it can’t match the performance of any of the above GPUs, it beats every single one at price. The wicked cheap 550 carves out a space for AMD that hasn’t really been feasible for any GPU maker in the last seven years. Intel Iris has been so good that GPU makers have never felt the need to compete for the hearts of budget-conscious consumers. But AMD has apparently changed its mind. Let’s be totally clear: The RX 550 won’t win any races, but it instantly makes games immeasurably prettier and faster than the discrete graphics built into an Intel processor. In our testing, we pitted it against the Iris Intel HD 630 that’s integrated into the Kaby Lake i7-7700K. When playing Civilization VI it ran nearly four times faster. Sponsored When playing Overwatch, with graphics set to the most intense setting (Ultra), the RX 550 was three times faster than the integrated GPU, though the game wasn’t actually playable at that setting on either the RX 550 or the HD 630: The RX 550 managed 17 frames per second, which is an excruciating experience to play, but the HD 630 was an even worse 5fps. With a frame rate that bad it’s sort of like you’re trying to play a game in stop motion. Higher is better for Overwatch. Lower is better for Civilizations VI and Blender. But when you drop the graphics settings to Low, Overwatch in 4K is downright playable with the RX 550, which managed a super smooth 70 frames per second. On the same settings, the HD 630 couldn’t compete, clocking a borderline unplayable 28 fps. With a frame rate that low, the game gets extremely choppy—making it difficult to pull off the quick, skillful shots. Advertisement The RX 550 even performed better when rendering 3D graphics for non game projects, though with smaller margins. The RX 550 rendered a big 3D file in Blender in 9 minutes and 40 seconds. The HD 630 took an extra five seconds. Good as it is, the RX 550's performance still pales when compared to the speeds you’d get with a “real” graphics card like the $200 Nvidia 1070 or new $200 AMD Radeon RX 580. Those cards can handle games like Mass Effect Andromeda and Rise of the Tomb Raider, which cause the the RX 550 and HD 630 to choke. The RX 550 is also MUCH smaller than the RX 580. The RX 550 is especially appealing for people building a cheap PC from scratch. It’s a leg up on Intel’s integrated GPU, and it is also perfect to pair with AMD’s excellent new Ryzen CPU. While the Ryzen processor beats Intel on speed at every price point, it notably lacks integrated graphics. If you tack on an $80 550, you’d match Intel on price beat Intel in performance across the board. And with AMD’s plan to go after Intel in the mobile space, this means a laptop with Ryzen and a RX 550 inside will likely be faster than a similarly spec’d Intel device. Advertisement If you’re the rare person with a tower PC, or you’re a builder eager to create something cheap, then the RX 550 is a good choice. And if you buy it and don’t like it, no big deal, it only cost $20 more than Mass Effect Andromeda. README The AMD Radeon 550 is faster than your integrated graphics. It is slower than any other video card you could get. It is also cheaper. A solid card for builders looking to put together an entry level PC. Will pair well with AMD’s new CPUs, which are cheaper and faster than Intel, but don’t have a GPU built in.

Expects to Continue to Supply Apple Inc. Despite an ugly legal battle between these two companies, Qualcomm still expects to supply Apple now and going forward. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 20, 2017 at 2:00PM For years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had relied exclusively on cellular modems from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to power its iPhone line of products. However, beginning with the iPhone 7, Apple chose to dual-source the modem from both Qualcomm and chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel appears to have gotten a significant amount of iPhone share, but that share is necessarily capped because Intel's modems don't support the CDMA standard, while Qualcomm's do. Image source: Apple. Intel's upcoming XMM 7560 cellular modem -- which should be ready in time for Apple's 2018 iPhone -- fixes this deficiency by adding support for CDMA. Given the legal battle between Qualcomm and Apple, there has been some concern and/or speculation that Apple might ultimately drop Qualcomm modems altogether in favor of Intel ones. Per comments Qualcomm made on its most recent earnings call, though, it seems that Qualcomm management isn't expecting Apple to sole-source from Intel in the foreseeable future. Qualcomm staying in the Apple supply chain In prepared remarks made by Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf on the company's April 19 earnings call, the executive said the company "will continue to focus on developing and delivering the best products to [its] customers, including Apple, consistent with [Qualcomm's] track record to date." Image source: Qualcomm. Mollenkopf further said that, "considering the strength of both [Qualcomm's] product roadmap and [research and development] investments, [Qualcomm] expect[s] to continue to be an important supplier to Apple now and into the future." Business and investment implications The way I view this is a "lack of significantly more downside" rather than, say, significant potential upside. It's better for Qualcomm to be in the Apple loop than to be completely cut out; this is a reasonably sized revenue stream that clearly contributes positively to gross profit and, ultimately, net income. So, if Qualcomm can defend what share it has at Apple, that'd obviously be good. At the same time, it's hard to get too excited for Qualcomm. Unless Intel really drops the ball in terms of future modem technology development (this becomes decreasingly likely as time passes, as Intel gains experience), I find it unlikely that Apple will want to go back to sole-sourcing cellular modems from Qualcomm -- especially in light of the allegations it has put forth against Qualcomm. So, while Qualcomm's statements seem to suggest that its iPhone cellular modem percent share has a non-zero floor, I don’t see much potential share upside, either. Foolish takeaway It's not a surprise that Qualcomm intends to continue to do business with Apple. After all, Apple has been in fiercer litigation before against a supplier (Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF)), and even as those two companies fought legal battles, Apple kept buying parts from Samsung. What I think will be interesting to see is what kind of modem share Qualcomm captures in Apple's upcoming iPhone models. Intel's upcoming XMM 7480 modem still won't support CDMA, so on networks that require CDMA, Qualcomm modems will be the only choice. The reason I'm interested in potential share shifts in this cycle is because I want to see if my hypothesis that Apple is using Qualcomm where it needs to while using Intel everywhere else holds up. If that hypothesis is correct, then we shouldn't see much of a shift during this product cycle, because Qualcomm already lost the share it was going to with the last product cycle. If Qualcomm loses significant additional share at Apple this cycle, then we'll know that my hypothesis was incorrect.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Gigabyte's latest Brix IoT packs a Core i3 for extra grunt by Wayne Manion  1:00 PM on April 20, 2017 A couple of weeks ago we wrote about Gigabyte's Brix IoT PCs—a pair of fanless miniature computers with Intel Apollo Lake SoCs inside. We read over at Fanlesstech that the company has expanded the Brix IoT range with models packing a dual-core 2.4 GHz Intel Core i3-7100U CPU. The brawnier GB-EKi3A-7100 also packs two USB 3.1 ports, though it loses some of the connectivity options present on its less-powerful siblings. The Core i3 machine has an HDMI jack and a mini-DisplayPort. When the appropriate DisplayPort daisy-chaining hardware is in play, the PC can drive three independent displays, something that's bound to be useful in digital signage applications. The Kaby Lake integrated graphics can drive 3840x2160 displays at up to 60 Hz, a step up from the 4K-at-30 Hz limitation of the Apollo Lake versions.   For peripheral connectivity, the EKi3A-7100 has a pair of USB 3.0 jacks, plus one USB 3.1 Type-A port and one USB 3.1 Type-C connector. The included Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity are all provided by Intel controllers. The Core version of the Brix IoT can run on input voltages from 12V to 19V. Gigabyte supplies a 65W, 19V external power brick with the machine. Serial UART connectivity is available with a standard nine-pin connector. Buyers who opt for the EKi3A-7100 instead of its smaller cousins will have to give up the microSD slot, the second Gigabit Ethernet port, and the GSM connectivity. The extra CPU power and graphics grunt make that exchange mostly a fair one, though. The Core version of Gigabyte's Brix IoT fanless mini PC measures a diminutive 7.1" x 4.6" x 1.4" (18 cm x 12 cm x 3.6 cm)—just a bit larger than the Apollo Lake versions in every dimension. Gigabyte did not provide pricing or availability information, though we expect the Core version to cost a bit more than the Celeron and Pentium versions.

Chromebook Review Chromebook vs. Laptop – Which is Right For You? Chris Stobing Updated January 12, 2017 Shares Can't decide on a Chromebook or laptop? Read our guide to find out which is right for you. Chromebooks vs. Laptops. It’s a battle that’s been raging for nearly five years now, with plenty of good points being made by those on both sides of the argument. But which portable computer is right for you, and which might hold you back? Read on to find out. Chromebook vs Laptop   Chromebook Laptop Operating System Chrome OS Linux, Windows, OS X 3rd Party Apps Allowed Highly Averse to Malware and Viruses WiFi Expandable Memory Expandable Storage Price Range Low to Medium Medium to High Operating Systems The Chrome OS is limited to Android like apps, which means 3rd party ones aren’t allowed. The three main competing laptop operating systems include OS X on Macbooks, Windows 10 on third-party laptops (Toshiba, Asus, Microsoft, etc), and Linux. Chrome OS, or in this case Chromebooks, which entered the fray not too long ago and is similar to that of Android, certainly isn’t for everyone.  However, it still serves its (limited) purpose pretty well across the board. I’ve personally used a Chromebook for two years as my road laptop, and not once has the OS ever crashed on me. There might be an occasional stutter during a 1080p video on YouTube, but otherwise the lean, mean design of the Chrome OS prevents it from experiencing any significant hangups. Windows is the exact opposite of this, of course. By this point the word “Windows” has basically become synonymous with “pulling your hair out”, and although OS X enjoyed a few years of flawless bliss when Macbooks were gaining in popularity, its reliability has since dropped quite a bit. That said, one of the main reasons both OS X and Windows have problems at all is because they support third-party software and applications, while Chrome OS does not. Last there’s Linux. Technically there are ways you can install a custom Linux build on a Chromebook, so if you’re not totally sold on Chrome OS but still want a new laptop for not a lot of money, check out this guide on which models can support the operating system swap.

The fact is Chrome OS is an extremely closed off ecosystem, one which only allows you to perform a few select functions and not much else. Google keeps their operating system secure by restricting what can be “installed” on a Chromebook, if you could even call it that. Almost all of the apps you “install” on your machine don’t actually run locally. Instead Chrome places an icon in your start menu, which is only a link to a website that supports the “program” in Flash or HTML5. The only true apps installed on the machine are the Chrome web browser, as well as offline versions of Docs, Sheets, and Google’s PowerPoint competitor, Slides. Macbooks and PCs on the other hand are made to be customized, and come with the option to install literally hundreds of thousands of different programs and types of software at once. If you need something that can run Photoshop, play your favorite games, or even run an .FLV video file, then a Windows laptop or Macbook will be the de facto choice. CPU and RAM Currently, all Chromebooks ship with Intel processors. Due to a deal inked between Google and Intel, almost all the Chromebooks released last year (and coming in 2017) are equipped with Intel processors. For the AMD faithful this may be an issue, but for most, the Intel mobile line and 5th-generation Core processors can handle Chrome OS just fine. It’s difficult to make a direct comparison of the amount of “power” you get from a Chromebook compared to a standard Windows laptop or Apple Macbook, largely because each one comes with an OS that uses its resources differently. Chrome OS is light, so it runs well on worse (less powerful) hardware.  So the comparison is a moot one. If you were to install Windows on a laptop that had identical specs it would run slower, simply for the fact that Windows has tons of extraneous processes and tasks it runs in the background while nothing else is going on. In short, Windows requires more horsepower to run, much like a big truck requires a larger engine over a smaller car. Storage One area where Chromebooks still need to catch up is with onboard storage. Because they’re made to be cheap and light, almost all Chromebooks come with an SSD opposed to a standard HDD, which ups the cost of manufacturing. As such, it’s rare to find any model of Chromebook with more than 32GB of available onboard storage. To compensate, most Chromebooks will come with 100GB of free cloud storage, provided by Google’s own Drive service. If the idea of keeping all your data on the cloud doesn’t sound like your cup of tea however, it might be better to simply go with a standard laptop instead. Laptops on the other hand come in pretty much any storage configuration you can think of. Want your operating system on an SSD and your games/movies on an HDD backup? There’s a laptop for that. Don’t mind long loading times and just want as much space as possible? There’s a 3TB hard drive just for you.  Screen The Toshiba Chromebook 2 offers an excellent screen for a Chromebook. In the pursuit of making these laptops as affordable as possible, sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Screen quality is an area where almost all Chromebooks lag woefully behind the 1366 x 768 curve, and it’s expected that unless it’s a model that specifically touts its HD-capability, you probably won’t be showing it off to your co-workers anytime soon. There are some exceptions to the rule, of course. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 was our number #1 pick of the lot for the best Chromebook 2017, a title it won in large part thanks to its absolutely 1920 x 1080 HD IPS screen. If you plan on watching a lot of Netflix or working with color-senstive creative materials online, this model is one of very few that would be able to handle it. On the laptop side of things – it’s a bit all over the place. Some laptops sport stunning 4K screens that can play Blu-Ray content at its absolute peak, while others are so grainy you can barely read a paragraph of text on them without having to adjust your glasses twice. Where touchscreens are concerned, while Windows does maintain the advantage on the sheer number of touchscreen laptops available, many of them are sub-par in quality.  Comparatively, the  ASUS Flip Chromebook made our top Chromebooks of 2017 list both for it’s solid design, and a touchscreen that responds to even the slightest graze of your finger. Keyboard and Trackpad While some Chromebooks are built as cheap as possible and come with keyboards or trackpads to match (looking at you, HP), others, like the Toshiba Chromebook 2, are an absolute dream to type on. Because Chromebooks are made as machines that can help you with work, school, or generally getting a lot of typing done, most of the keyboards on a Chromebook will do the job with flying colors. The trackpads on the other hand are a bit hit or miss. Cost-compared against Windows machines, you’re going to get a similar deal in quality. If you opt for a Macbook however, the trackpad will clearly be superior due to the increased price and money spent on the overall quality of the surrounding hardware. Webcam This one is a bit of an even draw. Chromebooks may come with some cheap components, but Google knows that of all the features that people want on a laptop, the webcam should be up to par. Comparing webcams from several of the top Chromebooks on the market right now against what you’d get in a Windows laptop or Macbook five times the cost, it’s clear that any Chromebook worth its salt will have a webcam that works in most lighting situations, even if you still can’t use it to call someone over Skype. Price Categorically, for the specs you get and the ease of use you should expect out of a device, price is where Chromebooks truly shine. Because Google doesn’t charge third-party companies for use of their OS, manufacturers can use the resources that would have otherwise been spent licensing the operating system on better specs. This means that on a direct 1:1 cost comparison, the hardware you get inside a Chromebook will always edge out what you might find in a competing Windows PC. As for Chromebooks vs. Macbooks; it’s not even a contest. Apple marks up their products by the handful compared to Google. And while a baseline 2015 Macbook Air will run you upwards of $999 at the checkout counter, a comparable Chromebook with the same specs would be nearly three times less, at $330. Read: Best Ultrabook 2017 The whole draw of Chromebooks is that they offer solid hardware at half the cost of what you’d spend on any other laptop. Although they may not have much software to speak of and their onboard storage capacities border on pitiful, you’re getting a fully-functional laptop at a discount so steep it would put lesser companies straight out of business. Which is Right for You, Chromebook or Laptop? In the war between Chromebooks vs. laptops – it looks like the winner comes down to personal preference. The only way you’ll really be able to decide if a Chromebook is right for you (or any members of your family), is to know what you’re going to use it for the most ahead of time. If you only need a machine that goes online, opens web pages, and lets you type to your heart’s content, a Chromebook is the perfect pick. If you think you might need more flexibility down the line however, it might be better to spend your cash on a Windows laptop or Macbook instead. Chrome OS is great for your kid’s first laptop or as a backup while you’re punching out the yearly expense report from an airport terminal.  But it lags behind when it comes to supporting most types of media playback, running third-party software, or gaming on the go. They’re cheap, they’re light, but they also don’t do a whole lot. If that sounds like the perfect marriage of just enough features at just a low enough price, then a Chromebook might be right for you.

Related Content Topic :  A Big Market for Big Data Jobs  If you think there isn’t a connection between home improvement and Big Data, reconsider, because Big Data is becoming a part of just about every major industry. Blog :  CISOs Admit They Are Unable to Keep Pace with Data Breaches Article :  Cybersecurity Ventures Top 50 Security Companies to Watch With IDF Gone, Could NVIDIA’s GTC Be Next? Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 20 Apr, 2017          |         |     Share The short answer to my title is no, NVIDIA’s GTC isn’t about to disappear. NVIDIA is currently one of the technology industry’s darlings, as it has been firing on all cylinders of late, largely because its executive team, led by founder Jen-Hsun Huang, rightly anticipated AI, deep learning and autonomous driving. This allowed the firm to expand outside of PCs and, with a resurgence in gaming, there really isn’t a part of its business that is doing badly. With Intel’s IDF becoming obsolete, the likelihood that other big shows will be discontinued is high and, I expect, most will be gone by 2030, because of technology that NVIDIA itself is helping to develop. Let’s talk about why NVIDIA’s GTC still makes sense, even though IDF doesn’t. Changes for Developers Much of Intel’s business is still tied to PCs and servers and the X86 architecture. But over time, Microsoft and more recently Google with Chrome, have been the primary places where developers go to work on PC platforms, and VMware and Microsoft, due to their virtualization platforms, for servers. Microsoft in particular has largely gone hardware independent with servers. Add to this cloud services like AWS, and suddenly going to an Intel developer event, at least for PCs and servers, just doesn’t make sense. However, on the graphics side, performance is still tightly tied to hardware and, for PCs, game developers still write relatively closely to the hardware and want to get as much performance out of the class of servers that use GPUs (often super-computers) as possible. This is the difference between a focused use like gaming, deep learning, and AI vs. a general use product. So, with graphics, connection to the vendor remains important and relevant. For now. New Markets Now, both Intel and NVIDIA are going after new market opportunities in cognitive computing, AI and autonomous cars. However, NVIDIA has been at it longer, and given that its technology for the new markets came from its efforts in the old, having an event that allows developers to not only bridge their skills but advance along a path already set makes sense. Intel, coming later to the segment, has to chase developers harder, which means it needs to go to them until they get to critical mass, and then, likely will be better served with focused events on each segment. This will allow Intel to build the critical mass that NVIDIA already has more quickly, and this reflects a difference between a vendor, NVIDIA, sustaining a successful effort, and another building one. One is about retention (NVIDIA) and the other is about expansion (Intel), showcasing that two very different strategies can work for vendors in very different phases of market development. VR, AI, and Deep Learning Could End It All However, I think it is fascinating that both firms are working on a platform that eventually could make both approaches obsolete. You see, events of any kind typically involve travel, coordinating with other events, and the changing availability of attendees and presenters. For instance, someone really screwed up this year and placed big events by Microsoft, Dell/EMC and NVIDIA right on top of each other. This happens way more often than you’d think.   VR and AI potentially could do for events what DVRs and cloud streaming did for TV: Decouple content from time and make the engagements far more personal. Sessions could be viewed when people needed, and had the time, to view them without the need for travel or the problems of conflicts. Content could be dynamically altered for the individual viewing the event, and those who viewed the content could be connected socially for questions, collaboration and feedback. With a deep learning system, both behind these future efforts and an AI (visual chatbot) in front of it, attendees would not only get a far more personal experience but one that would adapt to their unique skill set and personality type. As a result, events like IDF and GTC, which are constrained by time and location, would evolve into locations, like super forums, that are always open and always filled with the perception of (often computer generated) folks seeking the same things you are. In the end, events like IDF and GTC should evolve from physical places tied to dates to virtual places tied to your specific needs. So rather than Intel’s Developer Forum, evolution will take it to (insert your name here) Developer forum. The future will be all about you.

Intel's new 3D XPoint non-volatile memory technology, which has been on the cards publically for the last couple of years, is finally hitting the market as the storage medium for Intel's new flagship enterprise storage platform. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is a PCIe SSD using the standard NVMe protocol, but the use of 3D XPoint memory instead of NAND flash memory allows it to deliver great throughput and much lower access latency than any other NVMe SSD. 3D XPoint The potential significance of 3D XPoint memory is immense. When it was first publicly announced by Intel and Micron in 2015, 3D XPoint memory was a fundamentally different storage technology from the flash memory that dominates the market. It is the first new truly mass market, high-density solid state storage medium to hit the market since NAND flash itself. It comes at a time where the NAND market is booming like never before, but also at a time when we know that there is a definite end of the line for NAND. The ongoing transition to 3D NAND flash is just a temporary postponement of the fundamental limitations of flash memory. Once NAND can no longer scale in density and cost-per-bit, it will fall to paradigm changes and next-generation memory technologies (one of which will be 3D XPoint) to continue to carry the industry forward. There are many other new memory technologies that may compete alongside flash memory and 3D XPoint in the coming years, but 3D XPoint is the one that's ready to go mainstream now. In the near term, 3D XPoint is important because it offers a new set of performance tradeoffs entirely unlike NAND; tradeoffs that, for the right applications, can deliver performance far in excess of today's NAND products. By being able to read and write at the bit or word level - and not the 4K+ page level of NAND - 3D XPoint has the potential to deliver excellent performance across a wide range of workloads, but especially in minimally parallel workloads, which are common in the consumer and enterprise spaces. The drawback here is that, due to various factors regarding time, production, and scope, 3D XPoint is more expensive than NAND. It also comes in as less dense, to aid in ease of production in this first stage, but this also adds to the cost. For now, due to scale and other factors, it won't be able to replicate the sheer capacity and cost effectiveness that has made NAND storage so popular in all market segments. Due to the scale, especially as a first-generation version of the technology, the first 3D XPoint products are being aimed at speciality and high-margin markets: enterprise performance, consumer caching, etc. Future products promised from Intel should add non-volatile DIMMs to the mix, and then later on, if everything goes to plan, a potential wholesale replacement of NAND flash (or at least a strong competitor). The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X The new storage drive, and the focus of today's review, is the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. It uses a new NVMe controller Intel developed specifically for use with 3D XPoint memory. Where Intel's enterprise NVMe SSDs like the P3700 use a controller with 18 channels for interfacing to their flash memory, the Optane SSD's controller has only 7 channels. In order to achieve at least parity on peak performance, each of those channels has to provide much higher throughput than on a flash SSD, and it shows that each 3D XPoint memory die is delivering much higher performance than a die of flash memory. The first capacity of the Optane SSD DC P4800X to ship and the model we've tested here offers a usable capacity of 375GB from a total of 28 3D XPoint memory dies (four per channel) for a raw capacity of 448GB. 3D XPoint memory has better endurance than NAND flash, but not enough to get away without wear levelling. The fine-grained accessibility of 3D XPoint memory gets rid of a lot of the wear leveling and write amplification headaches caused by flash pages and erase blocks being larger than the sector sizes exposed by the drives, but the drive still needs some spare area plus storage for error correction overhead, metadata for tracking the mapping between logical blocks and physical addresses, and potential replacement of bad sectors, similar to normal SSDs. As with most NVMe SSDs, the Optane SSD DC P4800X supports a configurable sector size. Out of the box it emulates 512B sectors for the sake of compatibility, but using the NVMe FORMAT command it can be switched to emulate 4kB sectors. The larger sector size reduces the amount of metadata the SSD controller has to juggle, so it usually allows for slightly higher performance. The NVMe FORMAT command is also the mechanism for triggering a secure erase of the entire drive, and for flash SSDs the format usually consists of little more than issuing block erase commands to the whole drive. 3D XPoint memory does not have large multi-megabyte erase blocks, so a low-level format of the Optane SSD needs to directly write to the entire drive, which takes about as long as filling it sequentially. Thus, while a 2.4TB flash SSD can perform a low-level format in just over 13 seconds, the 375GB Optane SSD DC P4800X takes six minutes and 47 seconds. This is long enough that unsuspecting software tools or SSD reviewers will give up and assume that the drive has locked up.

It is worth noting that the performance specifications for the P4800X, as provided in the product specification sheets, cover a different set of metrics than Intel usually reports for their enterprise SSDs. Sequential performance is not mentioned at all, but the product brief has quite a bit to say about latency: average latency for QD1 reads and writes, and 99.999th percentile latency for both reads and writes at QD1 and QD16. The fact that Intel is publishing a five-nines QoS metric at all suggests that they plan to set a new standard for performance consistency. The throughput claims are also remarkable: half a million IOPS or more for reads, writes and a 70/30 read/write mix. There are already drives on the market that can deliver more than 550k random read IOPS, but those SSDs are far larger than 375GB and they require very high queue depths to hit 550k IOPS. There are even a few multi-TB drives that can beat 500k random write IOPS, but they can't sustain that performance indefinitely. The Optane SSD DC P4800X is promising an unprecedented level of storage performance both in absolute terms and relative to its capacity, so it is interesting to see where Intel is going to lay down its line in the sand. The P4800X will not really occupy the same niche as the multi-TB monsters that offer comparable throughput. With limited capacity but the highest level of performance, this Optane SSD most closely fits the role of SLC NAND based SSDs. SLC has disappeared from the SSD market as virtually all customers preferred to sacrifice a little bit of performance to double their capacity by using MLC NAND. One of the last high-performance SLC SSDs was the Micron P320h, a PCIe SSD from 2012 that slightly pre-dated NVMe and used 34nm SLC NAND flash. Anyone still using a P320h for its consistent low latency performance will be very interested in the P4800X. Outside of that niche, the Optane SSD will obviously be desirable for its raw throughput, but the low capacity may be problematic for some use cases. One of the unique and most notable performance advantages of the Optane SSD DC P4800X is that it does not require extremely high queue depths to reach full throughput. Enterprise customers have long had to design their systems around the fact that getting full performance out of the fastest PCIe SSDs requires loading them down with queue depths of 128 or higher, sometimes requiring applications to use dozens of threads for I/O. In the client space achieving such queue depths is outright impossible, and in the enterprise space it doesn't happen for free. The P4800X's high performance at low queue depths makes it a much easier drive to get great real-world performance out of. Intel originally introduced 3D XPoint memory as having far higher write endurance than NAND flash—on the order of 1000x higher. The Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for 30 drive writes per day (DWPD) for five years, and the current models shipping during this early limited availability period are only rated for three years, rather than the five years it expects the support for the full retail models. Intel says they're being extremely conservative with a new and unproven technology, and doing the math means that 30 DWPD doesn't provide any endurance advantage over the most highly over-provisioned flash-based enterprise SSDs. In terms of total petabytes written, the P4800X only has four-fifths the endurance of the SLC-based Micron P320h. Even allowing for Intel's original comparisons possibly having been relative to lower-endurance contemporary MLC or TLC flash, it seems like this first generation of 3D XPoint memory is not as durable as originally planned - the headline number of 30 DWPD is aimed at alleviating that issue, however for Intel to match its original intentions then the second and third generation parts will have to be a step up, and we look forward to testing them. Pricing The MSRP for the 375GB P4800X is $1520, though it will be quite some time before it can readily be ordered from major online retailers. At slightly more than $4/GB, the P4800X will be almost twice as expensive per GB as Intel's next most pricey SSD, the P3608 (which is really two drives in one plus a PCIe switch). Compared to Intel's fastest single SSD (the P3700), the P4800X will be more than three times as expensive per GB. In the broader SSD market, $4/GB is not completely unprecedented, but most companies selling drives in this price range don't even pretend to have a retail price. This Review For this review of the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, first, we are going to take a deeper dive into what 3D XPoint actually is. Then we go through our testing suite for enterprise drives, testing Intel's claims on performance. It is worth noting that there is no such thing as a general-purpose enterprise SSD. Enterprise storage workloads are far more varied than client workloads and it is impossible to make general statements about whether random or sequential performance is more important, what kind of mix of reads and writes to expect, or what queue depth is apporpriate to test with. Real-world application benchmarks are difficult to construct and typically end up being far more narrowly applicable than we would hope. Our strategy for this review is to provide a very broad range of synthetic tests with the knowledge that not all results will be relevant to all use cases. Enterprise customers must know and understand their own workload. Since this is our first time testing anything with 3D XPoint memory, this review includes some new benchmarks that would probably not be applicable to a flash SSDs review, making for some interesting numbers. 3D XPoint Refresher Introduction 3D XPoint Refresher Test Configurations Checking Intel's Numbers Random Access Performance Sequential Access Performance Mixed Read/Write Performance Final Words: Is 3D XPoint Ready?

Reply ATC9001 - Thursday, April 20, 2017 - link This is still significantly slower than RAM....maybe for some typical consumer workloads it can take over as an all in one storage solution, but for servers and power users, we'll still need RAM as we know it today...and the fastest "RAM" if you will is on die L1 cache...which has physical limits to it's speed and size based on speed of light! I can see SSD's going away depending on manufacturing costs but so many computers are shipping with spinning disks still I'd say it's well over a decade before we see SSD's become the replacement for all spinning disk consumer products. Intel is pricing this right between SSD's and RAM which makes sense, I just hope this will help the industry start to drive down prices of SSD's! Reply DanNeely - Thursday, April 20, 2017 - link Estimates from about 2 years back had the cost/GB price of SSDs undercutting that of HDDs in the early 2020's. AFAIK those were business as usual projections, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen a bit sooner as HDD makers pull the plug on R&D for the generation that would otherwise be overtaken due to sales projections falling below the minimums needed to justify the cost of bringing it to market with its useful lifespan cut significantly short. Reply bcronce - Thursday, April 20, 2017 - link The latency specs include PCIe and controller overhead. Get rid of those by dropping this memory in a DIMM slot and it'll be much faster. Still not as fast as current memory, but it's going to be getting close. Normal system memory is in the range of 0.5us. 60us is getting very close. Reply tuxRoller - Friday, April 21, 2017 - link They also include context switching, isr (pretty board specific), and block layer abstraction overheads. Reply ddriver - Friday, April 21, 2017 - link PCIE latency is below 1 us. I don't see how subtracting less than 1 from 60 gets you anywhere near 0.5. All in all, if you want the best value for your money and the best performance, that money is better spent on 128 gigs of ecc memory. Sure, xpoint is non volatile, but so what? It is not like servers run on the grid and reboot every time the power flickers LOL. Servers have at the very least several minutes of backup power before they shut down, which is more than enough to flush memory. Despite intel's BS PR claims, this thing is tremendously slower than RAM, meaning that if you use it for working memory, it will massacre your performance. Also, working memory is much more write intensive, so you are looking at your money investment crapping out potentially in a matter of months. Whereas RAM will be much, much faster and work for years. 4 fast NVME SSDs will give you like 12 GB\s bandwidth, meaning that in the case of an imminent shutdown, you can flush and restore the entire content of those 128 gigs of ram in like 10 seconds or less. Totally acceptable trade-back for tremendously better performance and endurance. There is only one single, very narrow niche where this purchase could make sense. Database usage, for databases with frequent low queue access. This is an extremely rare and atypical application scenario, probably less than 1/1000 in server use. Which is why this review doesn't feature any actual real life workloads, because it is impossible to make this product look good in anything other than synthetic benches. Especially if used as working memory rather than storage. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Thursday, April 20, 2017 - link the fastest SSD on the consumer market is the 960 pro, which can hit 3.2GB/s read under certain circumstances. This is the equivalent of single channel DDR 400 from 2001. and DDR had far lower latencys to boot. We are a long, long way from replacing RAM with storage. Reply ddriver - Friday, April 21, 2017 - link What makes the most impression is it took a completely different review format to make this product look good. No doubt strictly following intel's own review guidelines. And of course, not a shred of real world application. Enter hypetane - the paper dragon.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Haivision to Demonstrate Breakthrough Performance of Live 4K HEVC/H.265 Software Encoding at 2017 NAB Show Haivision contributions to the x265 open-source initiative have pushed boundaries on quality and performance of live video streaming on Intel processors Montreal(4/20/2017) – At the NAB Show 2017, Haivision will demonstrate a breakthrough in live 4Kp60 HEVC software-only performance video streaming, leveraging the unparalleled quality of x265 software encoding, while running at a performance level that was previously only possible with dedicated hardware. This demonstration will be presented by Haivision’s HaiGear Labs, the company’s technologies research group, at the Renaissance Hotel (suite Ren Deluxe – B) next to the Las Vegas Convention Center.       Through the use of commodity off-the-shelf processing capabilities, Haivision will showcase how x265 software encoding, running on readily available dual-socket servers from the Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2600 v4 product family, addresses the growing demand for high-quality 4K video streaming. This development brings down the costs associated with encoding live 4K video and enables 4K video streaming on ubiquitous Intel cloud compute architectures.   The foundation for these video streaming innovations come from the company’s four years of active involvement in the x265 open source project, a commercially backed initiative founded with the goal of producing the highest performance, most efficient HEVC/H.265 video encoder software implementation. Haivision is an original charter licensee of the x265 project and has made significant contributions to the x265 initiative through tight technology collaboration with MulticoreWare, the primary developer of the widely adopted open-source codec.   Haivision’s quality-to-performance in its live 4K HEVC demonstration leverages UHDKit, MulticoreWare’s extended encoding library built on top of the x265 HEVC encoder. By heavily investing in advancing UHDKit for low-latency live encoding, Haivision has been able to push the boundaries on what has been possible in HEVC software encoding.   “Haivision has been an active contributor to x265 and UHDKit and has helped MulticoreWare push the envelope with regard to live encoding performance,” said Tom Vaughan, VP and GM, Video, of MulticoreWare. “Haivision’s numerous contributions are invaluable to every user of x265.”   “Haivision’s long-term association with MulticoreWare’s x265 project and our tuning of the UHDKit for high performance streaming on the Intel platform has enabled our customers to benefit from software-only or CPU/GPU balanced performance,” said Mahmoud Al-Daccak, Haivision CTO. “We will continue to pioneer and contribute to these development communities that rely on open-source initiatives to move the streaming video industry forward.” As a pioneer in high performance streaming solutions, Haivision innovates in the areas of live hardware and software encoding/decoding, video stream transport and management. The company is dedicated to pushing the technology envelope, and fostering partnerships and collaboration within the industry to expand the ecosystems of performance video that its customers depend on.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / User patch unlocks Windows updates for Kaby Lake and Ryzen on Windows 7/8.1 User patch unlocks Windows updates for Kaby Lake and Ryzen on Windows 7/8.1 Matthew Wilson 16 hours ago CPU, Featured Announcement, Featured Tech News, Operating Systems Update: At this point, we are all aware of Microsoft’s update lock policy on systems featuring the latest CPUs from Intel and AMD. Essentially, those running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 can no longer receive important security updates natively if they are running a Kaby Lake or Ryzen processor. Fortunately, it looks like the community has already found a way around this lock with a home made patch. How did this all come about? Well after the March 2017 Windows update, one user discovered two new functions added to system file ‘wuaueng.dll’ adding two new checks: “IsCPUSupported(void)” and “IsDeviceServiceable(void)”. The open-source patch here essentially adjusts these checks to say that the CPU running in your system is supported and ‘serviceable’, meaning it will be eligible to receive updates once again, unless Microsoft makes a future change to remove this. The patch is an open-source effort put together by someone going by the online moniker ‘Zeffy’ and uploaded to GitHub. If you want to run Windows 7 or 8.1 on a Ryzen, Kaby Lake or even Bristol Ridge system, then you can use this patch to ensure you still receive security updates, just like you would if you were running an older processor. Original Story: A couple of weeks ago, we learned about Microsoft’s plans to lock down system updates for those using AMD’s new Ryzen and Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors on older versions of Windows. This essentially meant that while you could install Windows 7 or 8.1 on a system featuring one of the latest Intel or AMD CPUs, you would miss out on all updates, leaving your system without the latest security updates. Now, this policy is in effect, with a new message popping up for users attempting to update their older OS. If you are running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on a PC featuring one of Intel or AMD’s new CPUs, then you may start to see the following message pop up: “Your PC uses a processor that is designed for the latest version of Windows. Because the processor is not supported together with the Windows version you are currently using, your system will miss important security updates”. You will then be encouraged to install Windows 10. This policy will apply to future CPU releases from Intel and AMD too. However, there is no doubt that Windows 7 purists will figure out a way to block and avoid the pop-ups entirely. Still, it is worth considering the security aspect of things. KitGuru Says: This news shouldn’t be too surprising as Microsoft gave plenty of warning. However, I imagine Windows 7 and 8.1 users aren’t going to be too happy about receiving a new batch of pop-up messages in regards to upgrading to Windows 10.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide If You Don't Think You Need a Graphics Card, This $80 GPU Will Change Your Mind Alex CranzYesterday 10:11am Filed to: AMD Radeon RX 550 Review AMD Radeon Polaris GPUs Reviews AMD Radeon RX 550 178 9 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo For nearly a decade, common sense has dictated that most people don’t need a standalone graphics card in their computer. Gamers need them to make rich titles like Rise of the Tomb Raider hum, and some professionals, like video editors and 3D designers, need them to take the pain out of rendering huge multimedia files. For everyone else, a video card has been treated more like a luxury item than a necessary computer component. But AMD’s $80 Radeon RX 550, a graphics card that costs a little more than the brand new games you’ll render on it, is such a good value that it might make you rethink the notion that a graphics card is a splurge you should skip. Advertisement Currently available from major retailers, the $80 AMD Radeon RX 550 is intended to upgrade an old desktop or function as the centerpiece of a new super cheap PC build. Though AMD told Gizmodo there were plans for a mobile version that should appear as an option in laptops later this year. The RX 550 comes with ports for DVI, HDMI and Display Port. If you’re young, with dewy skin, zero wrinkles, and the ability to house six chili dogs in a row, then you might not remember the time when every computer, no matter how small, needed a video card. Then in 2010 Intel introduced a GPU directly integrated into the CPU that does the bulk of your computer’s work. Graphics integrated directly into the CPU meant computer manufacturers didn’t need to put a discrete graphics card in every computer, and consequently the RX 550's predecessors, the budget-friendly graphics cards of yore, basically died. The market today is dominated by powerful cards destined for demanding applications. Advertisement AMD confused some people Monday when it announced a new series of graphics cards based on its year-old Polaris microarchitecture. You see, back at CES in January, AMD announced a new, faster architecture known as Vega. Generally graphics card makers quickly retire the old architecture when the new one arrives. So, with Vega cards expected around E3 in June, AMD’s decision to potentially cannibalize those sales with some cheap Polaris cards seems silly. Besides the newly introduced RX 580, RX 570, and the RX 560—cards that replace last year’s RX 400 series, AMD announced the RX 550. It’s a card with no equal—While it can’t match the performance of any of the above GPUs, it beats every single one at price. The wicked cheap 550 carves out a space for AMD that hasn’t really been feasible for any GPU maker in the last seven years. Intel Iris has been so good that GPU makers have never felt the need to compete for the hearts of budget-conscious consumers. But AMD has apparently changed its mind. Let’s be totally clear: The RX 550 won’t win any races, but it instantly makes games immeasurably prettier and faster than the discrete graphics built into an Intel processor. In our testing, we pitted it against the Iris Intel HD 630 that’s integrated into the Kaby Lake i7-7700K. When playing Civilization VI it ran nearly four times faster. Sponsored When playing Overwatch, with graphics set to the most intense setting (Ultra), the RX 550 was three times faster than the integrated GPU, though the game wasn’t actually playable at that setting on either the RX 550 or the HD 630: The RX 550 managed 17 frames per second, which is an excruciating experience to play, but the HD 630 was an even worse 5fps. With a frame rate that bad it’s sort of like you’re trying to play a game in stop motion. Higher is better for Overwatch. Lower is better for Civilizations VI and Blender. But when you drop the graphics settings to Low, Overwatch in 4K is downright playable with the RX 550, which managed a super smooth 70 frames per second. On the same settings, the HD 630 couldn’t compete, clocking a borderline unplayable 28 fps. With a frame rate that low, the game gets extremely choppy—making it difficult to pull off the quick, skillful shots. Advertisement The RX 550 even performed better when rendering 3D graphics for non game projects, though with smaller margins. The RX 550 rendered a big 3D file in Blender in 9 minutes and 40 seconds. The HD 630 took an extra five seconds. Good as it is, the RX 550's performance still pales when compared to the speeds you’d get with a “real” graphics card like the $200 Nvidia 1070 or new $200 AMD Radeon RX 580. Those cards can handle games like Mass Effect Andromeda and Rise of the Tomb Raider, which cause the the RX 550 and HD 630 to choke. The RX 550 is also MUCH smaller than the RX 580. The RX 550 is especially appealing for people building a cheap PC from scratch. It’s a leg up on Intel’s integrated GPU, and it is also perfect to pair with AMD’s excellent new Ryzen CPU. While the Ryzen processor beats Intel on speed at every price point, it notably lacks integrated graphics. If you tack on an $80 550, you’d match Intel on price beat Intel in performance across the board. And with AMD’s plan to go after Intel in the mobile space, this means a laptop with Ryzen and a RX 550 inside will likely be faster than a similarly spec’d Intel device. Advertisement If you’re the rare person with a tower PC, or you’re a builder eager to create something cheap, then the RX 550 is a good choice. And if you buy it and don’t like it, no big deal, it only cost $20 more than Mass Effect Andromeda. README The AMD Radeon 550 is faster than your integrated graphics. It is slower than any other video card you could get. It is also cheaper. A solid card for builders looking to put together an entry level PC. Will pair well with AMD’s new CPUs, which are cheaper and faster than Intel, but don’t have a GPU built in.

accelerating decrease in solar prices, and how more quotes results in a greater probability of purchase News provided by EnergySage, Inc. 20 Apr, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article BOSTON, April 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- EnergySage published today its fourth semiannual Solar Marketplace Intel Report™, providing a comprehensive analysis of consumer behavior, demographics, and preferences, as well as a complete account of industry trends in the U.S. residential solar market in 2016. This latest edition of the industry-leading report presents several new datasets and analyses including an expanded list of new states, a review of the community solar landscape, and greater insights into solar shopper demographics. According to EnergySage data, the typical solar shopper is a mid-career male in his mid-40s with interests in real estate, financial services, and home services in addition to solar energy. This most recent report also features a new section analyzing residential solar data by utility territory. EnergySage compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar to today's electricity rates in territories served by Commonwealth Edison Co., Consolidated Edison (ConEd), Dominion Power, Florida Power & Light Co., Southern California Edison, and Xcel Energy. In all service areas, the LCOE of solar is lower than the 2016 residential electricity rate offered by the utility, affirming the comparative benefits of solar as a low-cost energy source. Other key insights in the latest Solar Marketplace Intel Report include: Solar prices are falling at accelerating rate Between H1 2016 and H2 2016, gross cost per watt on EnergySage dropped by 6.25%. That is more than triple the rate of decline from the first EnergySage Solar Marketplace Intel Report from July 2014 to June 2015, and the greatest rate of decline measured in any of the reports to date. This trend may reflect improved operational efficiencies at solar companies, lower customer acquisition costs via online channels like EnergySage, increased competition, and the low cost of solar panels and inverters. More quotes result in more sales Consumers who receive offers from multiple solar installers are significantly more likely to complete a solar purchase. EnergySage users who received 5+ quotes in 2016 were nearly eight times more likely to buy than those who received only one quote. These results offer a clear message: quotes from multiple installers will increase consumer confidence, and solar shoppers should be encouraged to seek multiple quotes. Solar shoppers are mostly male EnergySage used Solar Marketplace demographic data to develop a profile of today's solar-interested consumers, and found that three out of every four solar shoppers (77%) are male. This gender imbalance presents an opportunity for the solar industry to develop new messaging and outreach strategies to attract more female shoppers, and expand the product category to achieve true mass-market appeal. "This latest report speaks to the importance of transparency and comparison-shopping in residential solar," said EnergySage CEO and founder Vikram Aggarwal. "For the consumer, getting more quotes empowers them to make better-informed decisions. For the installer, more quotes results in increased consumer confidence, which in turn results in a higher likelihood of purchase. Comparison-shopping platforms like EnergySage make win-win situations like this possible."   EnergySage is the country's leading online comparison-shopping marketplace for rooftop solar, community solar, and solar financing, and is uniquely positioned to share solar market insights. This report furthers EnergySage's mission to support the healthy growth of the solar industry via consumer education and empowerment, price transparency, and greater information sharing among all stakeholders.

Unlikely to Lose Significant iPhone Modem Share This Year Worries that Qualcomm will lose significant modem share at Apple during this product cycle are probably overdone, though longer-term risks loom. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 20, 2017 at 8:30AM In a research note by way of Barron's, analyst Rod Hall says that Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) "baseband share position in the next-generation iPhone is becoming increasingly uncertainly because of the patent law suit." He is, of course, referring to the continued legal drama between Qualcomm and Apple. "Although we expect Apple to continue to use Qualcomm, we are concerned that 2017/2018 iPhone baseband share could shift toward Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)," the analyst writes. Image source: Qualcomm. Here's why I believe a serious share shift from Qualcomm toward Intel in the upcoming iPhone product cycle is unlikely. Intel can't take much more share It's generally believed that Qualcomm's modems are used in iPhone models destined for use on networks that require support for the CDMA standard, since Intel's current modems don't support this standard, while Intel's modems are used in models sold into regions and networks that don't require CDMA. For example, iPhone 7 models purchased from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or Sprint (NYSE:S) -- both CDMA networks -- will necessarily use Qualcomm modems. However, iPhone 7 models purchased from AT&T (NYSE:T) or T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), on the other hand, should have Intel modems inside. Image source: Apple. Although the exact ratio of Intel modems to Qualcomm modems that Apple uses isn't public knowledge, it's probably not too far off the mark to say that Apple is using Intel where it can and Qualcomm where it must. Intel's upcoming XMM 7480, which is presumably the Intel chip that Apple will use in this year's iPhone models, doesn't fundamentally change this equation, as it lacks CDMA support. This situation suggests that Apple will have limited opportunities to swap Qualcomm out for Intel during this product cycle. The next product cycle is totally different If there is reason to be worried about Qualcomm's cellular modem share at Apple, it'd be about what Apple does with the follow-on series of iPhones, which will presumably launch in the fall of 2018. Intel's follow-on to the XMM 7480, known as the XMM 7560, dramatically improves peak performance capabilities, adopts Intel's 14-nano manufacturing technology, and, most importantly, adds support for CDMA. Image source: Intel. Once the XMM 7560 hits, Apple should be able to substitute Qualcomm's modems for Intel's, practically at will, placing Qualcomm's current share at Apple in jeopardy. Now, as I've expressed in the past, I'm skeptical that Apple will completely cut Qualcomm out of the iPhone, even if Intel has the right technology to serve all of Apple's iPhone needs. Indeed, having multiple suppliers of such a critical technology is usually smart, and betting the farm on a single supplier that's only been able to build competent products for a couple of product cycles probably isn't wise. That said, I wouldn't be surprised to see Qualcomm's modem share at Apple trend downward in the coming years, particularly if the legal spat between the two companies remains unsolved or is resolved bitterly. Foolish bottom line Obviously, it wouldn't be ideal for Qualcomm if it were to lose more baseband share at Apple; it's a solid source of revenue, and Qualcomm should probably try to hang on to it the best it can. At the same time, though, losing Apple completely would be a setback but certainly not a world-ender for Qualcomm's chip business. Qualcomm ships a lot of relatively high-value chips -- namely, its integrated Snapdragon applications processors and modems -- to a wide range of smartphone customers, ranging from value devices all the way through premium flagship devices. As long as the smartphone market remains healthy, and as long as Qualcomm can continue to maintain and grow its market share across the broader smartphone market, then its chip business should -- over the long term -- be OK without Apple, should it ever come to that.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Tech for the 2018 iPhone This Fool digs in to see if this sketchy rumor holds any merit. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 20, 2017 at 9:15AM I regularly keep tabs on the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) section of a website called TheLayoff.com. The site's intended use is for current and former employees of a company to talk about potential layoff activity happening at that company. To be clear, the signal-to-noise ratio on TheLayoff's boards can be poor, especially as it appears that shareholders of competing companies sometimes appear to try to "troll" participants of the board. Image source: Intel. Nevertheless, while it's important to be highly skeptical of anything posted on such boards, sometimes there are posts cogent enough to merit further investigation. With that out of the way, let's look at a rumor that's cropped up on the Intel board at TheLayoff.com -- that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) won't be using Intel's upcoming XMM 7560 cellular modem for the 2018 iPhone. A corollary -- if it's true -- would be that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which had long been Apple's sole modem supplier until Intel captured share with the iPhone 7, would recapture iPhone modem share with the launch of the 2018 iPhone.  Here's the rumor "So apparently, Apple has no intention of using XMM7560 next year," the post begins. "Rumor from several sides is that they were supposed to sign an MoU regarding XMM7560 last year, but that signing kept being postponed." An "MoU" is a memorandum of understanding, which Investopedia defines as "a nonbinding agreement between two or more parties outlining the terms and details of an understanding, including each parties' requirements and responsibilities." The post continues by saying that "Apple has flat-out stated that they are not going to sign it until Intel has proven that the platform will [fulfill] all KPIs -- which is completely impossible." In this case, KPI stands for key performance indicator, which Klipfolio.com defines as "a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives." Finally, the post says that "Apple has stated that they have plans for a possible 2018 iPhone without [an] Intel modem, and they are quoted as saying 'It's no longer our Plan B, it's our plan A' now." Another poster, in response to this commentary, replied, "[T]hat is not even new information. Ship captain gave that info to core team in project meeting two weeks ago." Is this rumor credible? Here's my big problem with this rumor. Back at Intel's investor meeting in February, company management appeared to have a high degree of confidence that it would be shipping high volumes of its XMM 7560 cellular modem in 2018. Now, of course, Intel's disclaimer clearly applies here, in that it is a "forward-looking statement" that "involve[s] a number of risks and uncertainties," so it could very well be the case that Intel thought it was on track to land a significant chunk of Apple's 2018 iPhone modem orders but ultimately isn't meeting key development milestones. That said, without supporting evidence from a more reputable or non-anonymous source -- think Bloomberg, Reuters, or KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo -- I'm not inclined to put a ton of faith in this rumor. What I will be doing, though, is keeping my eyes peeled for reports from those reputable sources and publications for any news related to Apple's modem choice for the 2018 iPhone.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > ‘Leaked’ Intel slide backs rumors of… ‘Leaked’ Intel slide backs rumors of chipset support for Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 Gen2 By Kevin Parrish — April 17, 2017 11:44 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Intel will apparently not only support USB 3.1 Gen2 connectivity within its chipset for motherboards, but Wi-Fi supporting gigabit connectivity as well. In November of 2016, unnamed sources stemming from motherboard makers and component suppliers claimed that Intel planned to inject USB 3.1 Gen2 and Wi-Fi connectivity into its upcoming eighth-generation “Cannon Lake” 300 Series chipsets. Now a supposed “leaked” slide created by Intel backs those claims, showing what the chipset will support later this year. The authenticity of the slide is questionable given that it doesn’t have any Intel-based info or branding, AS typically seen on official slides. Here is the info versus the current details regarding Intel’s latest seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” 200 Series chipset: 200 Series PCH-H 300 Series PCH-H Total number of high-speed I/O ports: Up to 30 with flexibility Up to 30 with flexibility PCI Express 3.0 lanes: Up to 24 lanes Up to 24 lanes USB 3.1 Gen1 ports (5Gbps): Up to 10 ports Up to 10 ports total USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (10Gbps): — Up to 6 ports (part of Gen1 total) SATA 3.0 ports (6Gbps): Up to 6 Up to 6 M.2 SSD ports: Up to three x4 ports Up to three x4 ports Intel Optane support: Yes Yes DMI speed: x4 3.0 X4 3.0 Maximum processor PCIe 3.0 configurations: 1×16 2×8 1×8 + 2×4 1×16 2×8 1×8 + 2×4 Integrated Wireless AC support (gigabit Wi-Fi/Bluetooth CNV): — Yes As the supposed leaked slide shows, the only difference between the two chipsets (for now) is that the 300 Series includes USB 3.1 Gen2 technology, Wireless AC, and Bluetooth connectivity. To be clear, the collective that manages the USB standard redefined USB 3.0 when the second generation became final. Thus, USB 3.0 is now USB 3.1 Gen1 with speeds of up to 5Gbps. The new USB 3.1 Gen2 standard, which is usually associated with Type-C physical connections (Type-A is the full-sized rectangular port) and Thunderbolt 3, speeds along at up to 10Gbps. That said, Intel’s chipsets have supported USB 3.0/USB 3.1 Gen1 since the standard became golden. And now that USB 3.1 Gen2 is becoming more mainstream, Intel appears to be adding support for that 10Gbps connection as well. The fact that the leaked slide uses USB 3.0 terminology leads to speculation that perhaps it is nothing more than a screenshot of a document table conjured up by theorists using Intel-like colors for an “authentic” feel. In addition to USB 3.1 Gen2, the slide also suggests gigabit Wi-Fi. If that holds true, this detail could indicate that Intel plans to incorporate a component based on the 802.11ac Wave2 standard, which has a theoretical throughput range of up to 2.34Gbps by incorporating MU-MIMO technology. The Wave1 standard generally used today has a theoretical maximum throughput rate of 1.3Gbps based on SU-MIMO technology. Intel may wait on using the newer 802.11ad specification until the 400 Series chipset hits the market at the end of the year. 802.11ac Wave1 802.11ac Wave2 802.11ac Base Spec PHY Rate: 1.3Gbps 3.47Gbps 6.9Gbps MAC Throughput: 867Mbps 2.34Gbps 4.49Gbps MU-MIMO Support: No Yes Yes Modulation: 256 QAM 256 QAM 256 QAM Max spatial streams: 3 3 to 4 8 Max channel width: 80MHz 160MHz 160MHz 5GHz max speed: 1.3Gbps (433Mbps x3) 2.34Gbps (~560Mbps x4) 4.49Gbps (~560Mbps x8) 2.4GHz max speed: 433Mbps 433Mbps 433Mbps

There have been reports of late that the company has ordered the launch of its high-end desktop processors earlier than originally planned. Now, another report confirms earlier claims of a late May or early June launch in Taiwan. According to Digitimes, Intel has already made plans to unveil the latest Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors during this year’s Computex event in Taipei. The said event will be held between May 30 and June 3 this year. Also coming along the Intel  Computer presentation is the X299 chipset for the said processors. These new processors and chipset are meant to be unveiled in August. However, with the recent cancellation of the Intel Developer Forum, the company needed another event to host the launch. After the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X launch in Taiwan, the Basin Falls products will again make their appearances during the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. Intel HEDT processor (via intel.com) The Skylake-X line of chips consist of a six-core, eight-core, and ten-core variants. Only the Kaby Lake-X series will have a four-core variant. While the IDF has already been cancelled, Intel is still set to unveil its top-tier 12-core HEDT processor in August. This will be the biggest core count on desktop processors Intel will offer. However, later this year, AMD is also planning on releasing a 16-core chip in response to Intel’s 12-core processor. At the moment, AMD is gaining foothold with the release of the new AMD Ryzen series of processors. The high-end version of the said chip have been shown to go head-to-head with Intel current generation HEDT processor. This is perhaps the main reason why Intel has pushed for the release of its newest line of desktop processors two months ahead of schedule.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Is This Wall Street Firm Underestimating AMD? The yearlong run of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock came to a sudden halt  last week after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on the semiconductor specialist with a sell rating and an $11 price target, compared to the $13 that it is trading for at the time of writing. Analyst Toshia Hari believes that the chipmaker has gotten ahead of itself after its terrific 390%-plus rally over the past year, as rivals Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) could knock the wind out of AMD’s sails through discounted products. Hari’s research note points out that AMD’s market share won’t improve dramatically with its new products as NVIDIA and Intel could cut prices of their chips to keep the former under pressure. The analyst wrote, „While we expect Intel and NVIDIA to remain disciplined on pricing, if necessary, both companies have the capacity to compete on price given significantly higher gross margins.” Evidently, Hari’s thesis is based on AMD’s new products failing to do as well as expected because of competition from rivals. But this ignores the recent popularity of AMD’s GPUs that has led to a turnaround in the companys market share in recent quarters, and that its latest products are reportedly delivering more performance for less money — which could give the chipmaker an edge over NVIDIA and Intel. AMD’s GPU market share is fast improving AMD has broken into NVIDIA’s stronghold in the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market over the past year thanks to its focus on providing powerful graphics cards to gamers on a budget. GPU Supplier Q4 2015 Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Q4 2016 AMD 21.6% 22.8% 29.9% 29.1% 29.5% NVIDIA 78.3% 77.2% 70% 70.9% 70.5% Data source: Jon Peddie Research. It is now going after NVIDIA in high-end graphics with its latest Vega GPU, and could possibly match NVIDIA’s latest GTX 1080 Ti graphics card, if claims by an AMD executive (via The Inquirer ) are to be believed. Though AMD hasn’t released the tech specs and the pricing of the Vega GPU yet, it is expected to be in line with NVIDIA’s $699 price for the 1080 Ti, with a price tag between $600 and $700. According to leaked information the Vega GPU is going to pack a lot of computing power, and is said to be two times faster than the NVIDIA Pascal X in deep-learning scenarios. If AMD undercuts NVIDIA’s latest offering on pricing and delivers an identical performance, then it stands to gain more market share. AMD is going after Intel in server chips Intel has a vise-like grip over the server chip market, with a share of 99.3% in the third quarter of 2016. However, AMD is now going to try and hurt Intel’s near-monopoly in this market with its Naples architecture. The Naples CPU for servers was previewed by AMD in early March and is claimed to carry 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than Intel’s fastest Xeon server chip. AMD believes that the stronger specs allow Naples to perform at least twice as fast as the Intel offering in various seismic analysis scenarios, though independent benchmark tests will illustrate the real potential of these chips. Cisco forecasts that data centers will witness a 262% spike in traffic in 2020 from 2015 levels, processing 92% of the workload in the cloud. AMD’s movement into the server-chip market is timely, as data center servers are going to need a lot of processing power. Image source: AMD. Similarly, AMD is trying to challenge Intel’s stronghold in the desktop CPU market with its Ryzen CPUs. As it turns out, AMD’s flagship Ryzen 1800X CPU costs half as much as a comparable Intel Broadwell processor, which could make it the processor of choice for workstation users. Intel has recently lowered the price of its processors, indicating that it is scared of AMD’s potential gains in the desktop CPU market. Goldman doesn’t have much company Goldman Sachs’ bearish outlook on AMD is not in line with the Wall Street consensus. Jefferies and Susquehanna have both raised their price targets on the semiconductor specialist in the past month, citing possible market share gains — thanks to the growing adoption of its Ryzen chips — that could drive incremental sales of $1.1 billion to $4.6 billion. Three analysts have raised their earnings projections for the current year and none have revised down. Investors, therefore, shouldn’t get into panic-selling mode after the Goldman Sachs downgrade, as market share gains could boost AMD going forward. 10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Intel drops the curtain on the Intel Developer Forum by Jeff Kampman  2:03 PM on April 17, 2017 Intel unceremoniously killed its long-running Intel Developer Forum event series today with a terse announcement on the IDF site: Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. In past years, IDF served as a rich conduit for new x86-related product announcements, architectural details, and more happenings around Intel, making it one of the can't-miss events of the PC hardware calendar. The Tech Report attended and reported on many an IDF over the years, but it appears that yours truly's experience with the show will begin and end with IDF 2016. In a statement to Anandtech, Intel says that as it broadens its non-PC businesses, a single event like IDF doesn't let it communicate with its various communities the way it wants to. Indeed, the Kaby Lake CPU briefing from last year's event wasn't even officially part of IDF. Instead, it sounds like we'll be getting narrower, more frequent briefings like that Kaby Lake side event and the recent Optane Tech Day so that each new innovation or product gets enough breathing room in the future. Fair enough, we suppose. Still, losing IDF means losing a great opportunity to socialize with Intel employees, partners, and members of the tech press from around the world in one spot, and whatever comes next almost certainly won't fill that hole. Adieu, IDF. Tags: CPUs Miscellaneous Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

MSI Leopard Pro laptops sprint for the kill by Wayne Manion  2:30 PM on April 18, 2017 The current generation of chips fabricated on 14-nm and 16-nm processes have allowed for previously-unattainable levels of performance in thin-and-light laptops. MSI's Leopard Pro series of 15.6" and 17.3" laptops capitalize on the capabilities of Intel and Nvidia's latest silicon to offer capable gaming performance in thin form factors. The Leopard Pros can be outfitted with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050, GTX 1050 Ti, or GTX 1060 3 GB graphics cards to go along with Intel seventh-generation Core i7 processors. A pair of SO-DIMM slots let the machines take in as much as 32 GB of DDR4 memory. MSI says the laptops come with a single 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM installed, so those in need of maximum memory bandwidth might want to plan on installing a matching stick right away for dual-channel goodness. Networking connectivity comes by way of a Killer Gigabit Ethernet controller paired with an Intel 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2 combo card. MSI didn't say much about storage options, other than mentioning that the machines have a single M.2 slot and a 2.5" drive bay. Some Leopard Pro models sport a SteelSeries-branded keyboard with per-key programmable RGB LED backlighting. The machines come with 1920x1080 displays, and there are options for 120-Hz panels. Regardless of hardware selection, the 15.6" models cram everything into a chassis measuring 15.1" x 10.2" x 1.1" (or 38 cm x 26 cm x 2.9 cm) and weighing 4.8 lbs (2.2 kg). The 17.3" models are bigger but almost as thin, at 16.5" x 10.6" x 1.2" (42 cm x 27 cm x 2.9 cm), and tilt the scales at 6 lbs (or 2.7 kg). The Leopard Pros have already been let out of the bag, and their prices range from $1230 to $1600 depending on the configuration.

We are a bit puzzled as to what is going on with Intel these days, last year here in the Netherlands and well, many other spots in the EU, they cancelled all press-agencies and press contacts. E.g. sampling + info retrieving through Intel is gone. Now we get our info and samples through other ways then Intel these days, but it is indicative as to the why, how and what is going on with Intel. They just do not want to communicate with media anymore. This morning news reaches us that the yearly technology event IF, the Intel Developer Forum now is scrapped. here developers, media and analysts always have been briefed on new and upcoming technology.     "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions." It seems and feels like Intel is shifting and stepping away from the processor industry. Ian from Anandtech got a response back from Intel: I just got off the phone with Intel, discussing why IDF is being cancelled. The main reason I was given is that Intel has been changing rapidly over the last two-to-three years, especially as they are changing from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. With the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive, and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information. As a result, the decision has been made to find new ways to communicate with the audience (media, developers and companies) and the ecosystem with targeted events. These will be like the recent AI Day or Manufacturing Day, or be connected to partner events, or involve separate geocentric events. So rather than have one big melee on everything, Intel is set to split its message across several different areas in the hope that it accurately digs deep enough into every area. I was told that Intel wants to find a better way to present the experiences in each of the fields, and this is the way to do that. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

I don't understand why they're taking this approach. I also don't see what suggests Intel is stepping away from the processor industry, and more importantly, why. That's like if Yamaha suddenly stopped making musical instruments and strictly focused on motorcycles - sure, they could do that, but they're losing a huge source of profit. I figure desktop and laptop CPUs (so, not including servers) alone make up more revenue than all of the other mentioned products combined: * Intel is not known for their AI; meanwhile, companies like Google and IBM (both of which produce their own processors) have made newsworthy AIs. * Intel recently acquired companies like Altera, which as far as I'm concerned, were doing fine without Intel. FPGAs generally aren't a big sellers. * Though I personally see the benefits of Optane, it doesn't seem to be very appealing to most people. * Intel is trying WAY too hard when it comes to IoT. ARM and Arduino platforms have generally been more appealing, due to costing less and being simpler to set up. * What was the last truly innovative and noteworthy wireless technology Intel released? Widi/Mirrorlink don't count - that's basically just a glorified Wifi + VNC. * Nvidia and other ARM brands are also way ahead when it comes to automotive. It just seems to me that if Intel really is shifting away from CPUs and toward these other things, they're going to doom themselves.

Intel is a Goliath with clay feet,unfortunately (Im looking,aswell,at M$$$).Big company,big money stock,but only few useful ideas. They need to broke in pieces to work at today's useful tech.They think too much in the past,because they dont have a visionary CEO.

They have to diversify, their market for PC's is not only saturated (they have what, like 90%+ marketshare?) but the PC market itself is dwindling and clearly charging more to increase profits just pisses everyone off. So what exactly do they do? How do they make money selling CPUs? People here love to say "well they could try increasing performance more than 5% each generation" or something - but for 90% of the market, more performance isn't even necessary. Like if Intel released a processor tomorrow that's 500% faster, I would upgrade 0 machines at my office, because no one here does anything that requires more than an i3. So yeah, they are behind in all this stuff - but if they don't start diversifying they die anyway. Nvidia recognized this as they were in the same boat. They had vast majority of GPU marketshare - the only way to increase revenue was to either charge customers more or utilize their products and find new avenues for revenue. They were just smart enough to get into the AI/Cars/Etc before anyone really realized how big of a market it was. Intel was too slow and now they are playing catch-up in a bunch of areas, but they don't really have a choice. schmidtbag Maha Guru Posts: 1443 Joined: 2012-11-10 #5421877 Posted on: 04/18/2017 04:12 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Denial They have to diversify because their market for PC's is not only saturated (they have what, like 90%+ marketshare?) but the PC market itself is dwindling and clearly charging more to increase profits just pisses everyone off.

Intel was too slow and now they are playing catch-up in a bunch of areas, but they don't really have a choice. I completely get what you're saying, but many people seem to forget that Intel still makes around $11 billion in net revenue per year. I'm sure almost all of that is coming from CPUs, SSDs, NICs, and motherboards. Note how none of those are the products Intel is changing their focus toward. If Intel sticks with what they're known for, they will still remain over-powered for many more years. They have the money to really make a difference, but instead they're either playing it safe, or, they're dumping all their money into markets where they're severely behind. There are plenty of tech markets out there that don't have much competition, yet Intel decides to join the ones that are very competitive, well-established, and don't yield much interest to either the general public or industries.

You're absolutely right - Intel isn't going to save themselves by continuously making faster CPUs. It's exactly that mentality why Intel is losing sight of what they should be doing - improving efficiency. We don't need faster CPUs anymore. We don't need more threads. What we need is to keep up the same performance while lowering the wattage. Intel is so blinded by "moar iz better!" that they had to drop out of the smartphone market. Their phone CPUs were over-complicated, over-powered, and were way too expensive. From what I recall, some had thermal problems too. Even AMD is putting more of an effort toward efficiency. As much as AMD is just a little ant that could be squished at the whim of Intel, I suspect they'll last longer as a company, because they're forced to adapt in order to stay afloat. Intel never needed to know how to do that, and these decisions they're making exemplify that.

'Turkey’s Intel Agency MİT Helped Jihadists Kidnap Foreigners In Syria.': Stockholm Center of Freedom. (Stockholmcf). A Turkish al-Qaeda militant who had been involved in kidnapping for a ransom to raise revenue for the radical armed group was saved by the government of Turkey’s autocratic President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who hushed up the probe, thwarted the trial hearings and eventually secured the release of all suspects from prison. The operative’s name is Orhan Yaşar, 43 year old (DOB: July 11, 1974) from the the Suruç district of Turkey’s southeastern province Şanlıurfa on Turkish Syrian border. He was involved in the scheme of kidnapping and later the release of Turkish photo-journalist Bünyamin Aygün of Milliyet daily from his captives in al-Qaeda affiliated armed group in Syria. Yaşar had been probed as part of the confidential investigation file No. 2012/1361 which was launched by the Office of the Public Prosecutor in the Eastern province Van in 2012. Yaşar was detained in a sweeping al-Qaeda operation on January 14, 2014 and formally arrested few days later. He and other suspects in the case were indicted on July 2014. But Yaşar was released pending a trial on the first hearing in the case by Van No.3 High Criminal Court on August 6, 2014.  The release of Yaşar did not make a sense at all given the fact one of the wiretap evidence in the case file revealed how he and his al-Qaeda cell leader was tipped off about the ongoing probe and planning to flee Turkey before police detained them on January 2014. Most likely the MİT learned about the police investigation file and passed that info to al-Qaeda suspects. As soon as the prosecutor was alerted by the investigators that suspects were made aware of the probe, he ordered their detention before they could have escaped the country. There are five wiretap recordings in the investigation file that revealed how Yaşar involved in abduction of foreign nationals by al-Qaeda affiliated Jihadist groups in Syria. The case file includes a wiretap recording that shows Yaşar was discussing the kidnapped Turkish photo-journalist Bünyamin Aygün, and Spanish correspondent Javier Espinosa and Spanish freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova. Aygün was kidnapped on Nov.26, 2013 while Spanish journalists were kidnapped on Sept.16, 2013. Yaşar was urging his contact to locate these journalists, and ask for a ransom money from their families. “Without taking any [ransom] money, do not release him [Aygün],” Yaşar was recorded as saying according to the investigation file submitted to the court. All three journalists were eventually released from captivity but there was no mention of any ransom money was paid in exchange of their freedom. When asked about that, Aygün simply said he had no knowledge of such transaction. The interesting part of his kidnapping is that Turkish media reported that MİT teams helped secure his release and took him back to Turkey. The controversial charity group International Humanitarian Relief (IHH), accused by Russia at the UN Security Council for smuggling arms to rebels in Syria, was also involved in negotiations for Aygün’s release. In other words, while MİT had been helping Jihadists to organize kidnapping, ransom demanding and even killing hostages, it was also brokering the release of hostages to save the day and appear as a hero at the same time. If the MİT was helping Jihadist groups to arm, fund and resupply themselves as the evidence in the prosecutor’s confidential file suggests, it should not come as a surprise that these hostages were easily picked up from the hands of Jihadist groups.

Goldman Sachs believes that competition could take AMD down, but this Fool thinks otherwise. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 19, 2017 at 7:53PM The yearlong run of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock came to a sudden halt last week after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on the semiconductor specialist with a sell rating and an $11 price target, compared to the $13 that it is trading for at the time of writing. Analyst Toshia Hari believes that the chipmaker has gotten ahead of itself after its terrific 390%-plus rally over the past year, as rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) could knock the wind out of AMD's sails through discounted products. Hari's research note points out that AMD's market share won't improve dramatically with its new products as NVIDIA and Intel could cut prices of their chips to keep the former under pressure. The analyst wrote, "While we expect Intel and NVIDIA to remain disciplined on pricing, if necessary, both companies have the capacity to compete on price given significantly higher gross margins." Evidently, Hari's thesis is based on AMD's new products failing to do as well as expected because of competition from rivals. But this ignores the recent popularity of AMD's GPUs that has led to a turnaround in the companys market share in recent quarters, and that its latest products are reportedly delivering more performance for less money -- which could give the chipmaker an edge over NVIDIA and Intel. AMD's GPU market share is fast improving AMD has broken into NVIDIA's stronghold in the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market over the past year thanks to its focus on providing powerful graphics cards to gamers on a budget. GPU Supplier Q4 2015 Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Q4 2016 AMD 21.6% 22.8% 29.9% 29.1% 29.5% NVIDIA 78.3% 77.2% 70% 70.9% 70.5% Data source: Jon Peddie Research. It is now going after NVIDIA in high-end graphics with its latest Vega GPU, and could possibly match NVIDIA's latest GTX 1080 Ti graphics card, if claims by an AMD executive (via The Inquirer) are to be believed. Though AMD hasn't released the tech specs and the pricing of the Vega GPU yet, it is expected to be in line with NVIDIA's $699 price for the 1080 Ti, with a price tag between $600 and $700. According to leaked information the Vega GPU is going to pack a lot of computing power, and is said to be two times faster than the NVIDIA Pascal X in deep-learning scenarios. If AMD undercuts NVIDIA's latest offering on pricing and delivers an identical performance, then it stands to gain more market share. AMD is going after Intel in server chips Intel has a vise-like grip over the server chip market, with a share of 99.3% in the third quarter of 2016. However, AMD is now going to try and hurt Intel's near-monopoly in this market with its Naples architecture. The Naples CPU for servers was previewed by AMD in early March and is claimed to carry 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than Intel's fastest Xeon server chip. AMD believes that the stronger specs allow Naples to perform at least twice as fast as the Intel offering in various seismic analysis scenarios, though independent benchmark tests will illustrate the real potential of these chips. Cisco forecasts that data centers will witness a 262% spike in traffic in 2020 from 2015 levels, processing 92% of the workload in the cloud. AMD's movement into the server-chip market is timely, as data center servers are going to need a lot of processing power. Image source: AMD.  Similarly, AMD is trying to challenge Intel's stronghold in the desktop CPU market with its Ryzen CPUs. As it turns out, AMD's flagship Ryzen 1800X CPU costs half as much as a comparable Intel Broadwell processor, which could make it the processor of choice for workstation users. Intel has recently lowered the price of its processors, indicating that it is scared of AMD's potential gains in the desktop CPU market. Goldman doesn't have much company Goldman Sachs' bearish outlook on AMD is not in line with the Wall Street consensus. Jefferies and Susquehanna have both raised their price targets on the semiconductor specialist in the past month, citing possible market share gains -- thanks to the growing adoption of its Ryzen chips -- that could drive incremental sales of $1.1 billion to $4.6 billion. Three analysts have raised their earnings projections for the current year and none have revised down. Investors, therefore, shouldn't get into panic-selling mode after the Goldman Sachs downgrade, as market share gains could boost AMD going forward.

Apple's iPad Fights For the Education Market View All Editorials → Why Apple Will Be Using Xeon CPUs in This Fall’s “Pro” iMac John Martellaro @jmartellaro 3 minute read Apr 19th, 2017 5:33 PM EDT | Analysis Recently, we learned that Apple may be seriously considering the use of a Xeon CPU in its so-called “server-grade” iMac planned for later this year. There are good technical reasons why the use of the Xeon has entered the discussion in what has traditionally been considered a consumer iMac—in contrast to the Mac Pro which has had Xeons all along. Image credit: Intel. Like may elements of society, personal computers are also falling into what’s called a bimodal distribution. Education is a case in point. The advent of inexpensive tablets (and Chromebooks) that can do most of what’s needed has left a gap in the middle price range. More advanced students, professors and researchers, however, need the computational and graphics power to do advanced work. There’s a pricing hole in the middle. Similarly, in professional circles, where Apple left a performance gap in its aging Mac lineup, other companies, notably, HP have moved in and catered to those pros with really powerful workhorse machines that have more memory, better memory bandwidth, and more computational punch. Apple appears to have become sensitive to this movement and the demands of the creative and technical professionals. See, for example: Apple’s Pro iMac to Compete with Microsoft Surface Studio Apple Throws a Mac Pro Hail Mary, Promises Redesigned Model Coming The Xeon Angle The technology, nomenclature and models of the various Xeon processors can quickly become complicated. I’m going to keep it at a high level and cite just a couple of sources. (Here are some additional technical details, as background, for the geeks.) I started with the idea that I’m seeing more and more references to Xeons in areas where it seemed that Core i5 and i7 dominated almost exclusively. It’s probably that bimodal trend. I asked Jim Christensen at HP about it, with the initial hunch that a Xeon is required for Error-correcting Code (ECC) Memory. He confirmed that and told me: The reason behind Xeon and ECC memory is for data integrity mainly. The combination provides server class data and calculation integrity that is not available in Core processors. Xeon processors also tend to have faster clock speeds. I got further confirmation directly from Intel. It’s not as if there’s been a dramatic reduction in Xeon prices or any new emphasis by Intel. Xeons have been around since 1998. Rather, the demands of professionals have meshed well with the entry-level E3-class Xeons. Stephen Gabriel at Intel told me: The Xeon E3-1200 series targets entry level workstations that focus on more performance, more memory, professional VR, graphics rendering, video production, greater memory bandwidth. This is why, for example, there is an option for the E3-1200 V5 in the HP Z2 Mini entry-level workstation that I recently reviewed. The E3 supports only one processor with multiple cores. Some Xeon Advantages In general, then, here are some reasons to select a Xeon CPU, the E3 class, in preference to a Core i7.  Briefly and not exhaustively, It supports ECC Memory. It generally supports higher clock rates. But that means more heat. Tech professionals accept that. Computational power beats “thin.” The memory bandwidth is greater. It can access more memory than the Core series, typically 64 GB. The “Pro” iMac Apple was evidently taken aback by the Microsoft Surface Studio announced last October. In parallel, HP has been working on some very serious Z notebooks and workstations that appeal strongly to professionals. If my email is a glimmer, Apple has come under strong pressure from those creative and technical professionals: “Give us the power we need, or we’ll look elsewhere.” Accordingly, the article I cited above suggests that this fall’s “pro” iMac will have a Xeon E3-1285 v6. The Xeon E5, E7 For clarification, there are three levels of Xeons. I’ve mentioned the entry-level E3 above. The E5 is a mid-range system for high-end desktop workstations. These Xeons don’t have integrated graphics, and so they’re geared towards a partnership with a very high end GPU. A familiar example is the 2013 Mac Pro with its E5-1620 v2 (and AMD FirePro GPUs) that supports multiple processors, each with multiple cores. (The FirePro was strong in 2013, not so much now.) And so, we can likely expect the 2018 Mac Pro that Apple recently talked about to have an E5-class CPU and very powerful discrete graphics. The E7-class Xeon is used primarily in very high-end server farms in data centers. You won’t see one in your Mac any time soon. Summary Technical and creative professionals need extreme silicon quality and stability, high memory bandwidth, lots of RAM and ECC memory for mission critical uses. If Apple is going to regain the trust and admiration of technical professionals who want to use 5K (8K?) iMacs for high end CAD, graphics, professional VR, video production, and scientific computation, then it’s a very natural thing to move to the E3-class Xeons. For those who need even more power and the benefits of their own specialty displays, the (presumed) 2018 Mac Pro with E5-class Xeons and massively capable graphics can carry an even higher load. All in all, it appears as if Apple is back on the Mac extreme power bandwagon, and it’s very welcome indeed. _____________________ Jim Tanous helped with some aspects of this article.

Two factual errors in this article: 1. Xeons are made of higher quality silicon. Not true. They are made from the same bins as the Core series. As a system builder who has sent out thousands of systems, I have only seen two CPUs come back that went bad… and one of them was a Xeon. 2. Xeons tend to have higher clock speeds. Not true. The Core K-series chip have higher clock speeds and lead all CPUs in single thread performance. Xeons tend to be clocked lower, especially since they also tend to have higher core counts than the Core series. That latter point is where they outperform Core series chips, in multi-threaded performance. There are only two reasons why Apple would go with Xeons for the iMac: 1. ECC memory – a dubious benefit to the average iMac buyer, who is a prosumer that does not often do mission critical work. 2. Branding, by which to charge more money for a system with a chip that is only marginally more reliable (by virtue of ECC memory) than a Core chip. April 19, 2017 at 9:58 EDT PM cubefan April 20, 2017 There’s a really good reason why Xeon’s don’t have a GPU, servers are almost invariably headless – they have a VGA output at 1024×780 for setup and that’s it. Virtualised platforms like VMware and KVM eat as much CPU and RAM as you can throw at them, and MacOS is no different, because of its Unix roots. Separate GPU’s make sense for top-end systems so why use a chipset that has a GPU embeddded?, and we all know that Apple wants to develop its own GPU’s which will fit perfectly well in an iDevice or an iMac or Mac Pro. All of these CPUs are ‘fast enough’, the extra RAM is what matters, coupled with a more complete in-house development cycle. Now Apple have cracked the interface between their processors and Intel in the Macbook I’d expect to see more hybrid systems with both types of processor and GPU inside.

Pai was responding to questions in a post-FCC meeting press conference Thursday (April 20). He said the conversation was not about any pending proceeding, but outside of that context he was soliciting input on how to "Secure online consumer protections." He said that he has been consistent in saying that he favors a free and open Internet and opposes Title II. According to sources he has talked with telecom trade groups about what to do next on network neutrality, including possibly have the Federal Trade Commission enforce voluntary commitments not to block or degrade, but he signaled at the press conference that that was part of the same input-collection process generally and not about any pending proceeding. A reporter had noted that there had been no ex parte filing on that meeting, which would be required if it had dealt with a proceeding currently before the commission. Pai said he did not outline a regulatory plan for rolling back Title II in that trade group meeting. "We did not discuss the merits of any pending proceeding," he said, but, again, generally how to "secure some of those principles of a free and open Internet that I think most people agree on." Pai said he was "reaching out and trying to solicit a diversity of views among a diversity of stakeholders" and that he thought for their part they recognized, as he did, that "there is a lot of common ground here with respect to the need for a free and open Internet."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: nSeika Hack lets older Windows users get around Windows 10 update restriction Chris Smith @chris_writes April 20th, 2017 at 6:29 PM Share Tweet Microsoft keeps saying that it’s not going to be as aggressive about Windows 10 upgrades as it used to be, but actions speak louder than words. Recently, users discovered that they were not able to receive the latest security updates on their Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 PCs that are powered by newer Intel chips. Microsoft issued a new tool that checks a computer’s processor and prevents it from receiving any updates in case it detects it’s a new generation CPU on a computer running a Windows version that’s not Windows 10. As expected, someone was able to crack Microsoft’s restrictions and re-enable updates. Don't Miss: Niantic is finally addressing Pokemon Go’s biggest problem Both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are still supported. We’re looking at three and six years of updates, respectively. But Microsoft would rather have you upgrading that new PC to the latest version of Windows 10. One way to convince you to pull the trigger is trying to prevent your laptop from receiving system updates meant to keep your PC safe. To be fair, Microsoft did warn Windows users about what’s coming. New Intel chips won’t support older Windows versions, Microsoft said all the way back in 2016. However, when Patch Tuesday came last week, and Windows 10 Creators Update along with it, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users discovered they were not able to receive their security updates. Microsoft’s tool was already in place giving an error message that read “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” One Windows user took it upon himself to fix this issue, ZDNet reports. Developer Zeffy posted a new patch on GitHub that stops Microsoft’s tool from checking your computer’s processor age. That means any Kaby Lake or Bristol Ridge Ryzen users can install the security updates for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 after using this unofficial patch. According to the developer, Microsoft’s March 16 update for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 came with this changelog entry: “Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update.” As Zeffy put it, that’s “essentially a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10”. You can get Zeffy’s fix at this link.

Twitter Facebook Qualcomm: First Windows 10 ARM PC coming in the fourth quarter But don't expect a flood of Windows 10 PCs based on ARM chips Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 21 April, 2017 05:00 - - - - print email Comments If you want a Windows 10 PC that doesn't have an x86 chip from Intel or AMD, your wish will be granted in the fourth quarter. Qualcomm said the first cellular laptop with Windows 10 and its ARM-based Snapdragon 835 will come by the end of the year. "Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into mobile PC designs running Windows 10," and it's scheduled to launch in the fourth quarter, said Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm, according to a transcript of a Wednesday earnings call posted on Seeking Alpha. Until now, Windows 10 has worked only on x86 chips. Qualcomm and Microsoft are collaborating to make the ARM-based Windows 10 PCs. The thin-and-light device could be used as a tablet or laptop. It will take design cues from smartphones and is being called a cellular PC by Qualcomm and Microsoft. The device will always be connected to a cellular network with a high-speed modem, much like a smartphone. It will have other wireless connectivity features like Bluetooth 5 and possibly Wi-Gig, which are integrated into the Snapdragon 835 chipset. The cellular PC could also have a long battery life, considering Snapdragon 835 was designed for smartphones. Expect the superlight laptops to be 4K video capable with a powerful Adreno 540 GPU in the Snapdragon 835. No major PC maker has yet announced an ARM-based Windows PC, though there's a company running a Kickstarter campaign to build an 8.2-inch device. Don't expect a rash of ARM-based Windows 10 PCs to hit the market right away. Qualcomm is cautious and wants to initially test the market. Efforts to marry Windows PCs with ARM haven't worked well in the past, with customers rejecting Windows RT tablets. PC makers like Dell and HP have expressed interest in cellular PCs but need time to test the devices. HP wants to see if there's enough demand for such a device before making a decision. There are also questions about the number of x86 applications that will be compatible with ARM PCs, a major issue with Windows RT. Qualcomm promises that all x86 applications will work on the ARM PC, and Microsoft has shown demonstrated Photoshop running on Snapdragon 835. The Windows 10 ARM PC will emulate the functionality of x86, which could slow down applications. The PC may not be useful to run resource-heavy applications but is aimed more at productivity applications. Qualcomm is already doing well in the smartphone market, and the Snapdragon 835 is powerful enough to run PCs. Moreover, the company wants to assert itself as an all-encompassing chipmaker that can take on Intel in PCs and servers. Qualcomm's 48-core server chip called Centriq 2400 will start shipping later this year, and it'll compete with Intel's Xeon, which rules the server market. Microsoft and Qualcomm work closely together on smartphones, and the Windows 10 Mobile OS requires Snapdragon chips. Beyond that, Qualcomm has been warming up to Microsoft in other areas as well. The two companies showed Microsoft's Windows Server OS running on Qualcomm's Centriq 2400 chip, though it's not certain if the OS will ever be commercially released for ARM. Linux and x86 chips dominate the server market. As Qualcomm becomes more friendly with Microsoft, the chipmaker is having a rough time with its long-time partner Apple, which has filed a spate of lawsuits and complaints in China, the U.S., the U.K., and Japan. Apple has claimed that Qualcomm used its dominant market position market to overcharge on chip licensing fees. Qualcomm, in the earnings call, said that Apple suppliers -- which acquire the licenses on behalf of the iPhone maker -- owe about US$1 billion in licensing fees. Apple is Qualcomm's major customer, so the uncertainty around licensing fees is making it difficult for the chipmaker to make revenue projections. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Qualcomm said the first cellular laptop with Windows 10 and its ARM-based Snapdragon 835 will come by the end of the year. “Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into mobile PC designs running Windows 10,” and it’s scheduled to launch in the fourth quarter, said Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm, according to a transcript of a Wednesday earnings call posted on Seeking Alpha.  Until now, Windows 10 has worked only on x86 chips. Qualcomm and Microsoft are collaborating to make the ARM-based Windows 10 PCs. The thin-and-light device could be used as a tablet or laptop. It will take design cues from smartphones and is being called a cellular PC by Qualcomm and Microsoft. The device will always be connected to a cellular network with a high-speed modem, much like a smartphone. It will have other wireless connectivity features like Bluetooth 5 and possibly Wi-Gig, which are integrated into the Snapdragon 835 chipset. The cellular PC could also have a long battery life, considering Snapdragon 835 was designed for smartphones. Expect the superlight laptops to be 4K video capable with a powerful Adreno 540 GPU in the Snapdragon 835. No major PC maker has yet announced an ARM-based Windows PC, though there’s a company running a Kickstarter campaign to build an 8.2-inch device. Don’t expect a rash of ARM-based Windows 10 PCs to hit the market right away. Qualcomm is cautious and wants to initially test the market. Efforts to marry Windows PCs with ARM haven’t worked well in the past, with customers rejecting Windows RT tablets. PC makers like Dell and HP have expressed interest in cellular PCs but need time to test the devices. HP wants to see if there’s enough demand for such a device before making a decision. There are also questions about the number of x86 applications that will be compatible with ARM PCs, a major issue with Windows RT. Qualcomm promises that all x86 applications will work on the ARM PC, and Microsoft has shown demonstrated Photoshop running on Snapdragon 835. The Windows 10 ARM PC will emulate the functionality of x86, which could slow down applications. The PC may not be useful to run resource-heavy applications but is aimed more at productivity applications.  Qualcomm is already doing well in the smartphone market, and the Snapdragon 835 is powerful enough to run PCs.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Next Generation Memory Is Becoming An Rapidly Important Standalone Branch Of Electronic Devices, (low Power Consumption) Orbis Research Present’s Global Next Generation Memory Market to grow at a CAGR of 66.63% during the period 2017-2021 SUITE 600, DALLAS, TEXAS, UNITED STATES, April 20, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — Markets and Trends– Global Next Generation Memory Market 2017-2021 The Following Companies as the Key Players in the Global Next Generation Memory Market: Cypress Semiconductor, Fujitsu, Intel, IBM, Micron Technology, ROHM Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics, Texas Instruments, and Toshiba. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Adesto Technologies, Crossbar, and Everspin Technologies. Commenting on the report: “One trend in market is growing emergence of new FeRAM design using CMOS processes. Researchers have designed flexible FeRAM devices using state-of-the-art CMOS processes that involve sputtering, photolithography, and reactive ion etching. Their research led to a reduction in the gap between a rigid, inflexible semiconductor, which has high integration density, performance, and yield, and highly flexible polymer/hybrid materials that are low-performance electronics. To reduce the thickness of traditional silicon wafers and make electronics flexible, researchers used the existing standard CMOS fabrication processes.” Enquir For Global Next Generation Memory Market Research Report At: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/enquiry-before-buying/256319 According to the report, one driver in market is low power consumption. Next-generation memory technologies are mostly used in battery-powered wireless sensors, as they consume approximately 50% less power than other flash memories. This increases the battery life, leading to a reduction in maintenance costs. Thus, vendors in the market get the advantage to compete based on prices. Moreover, due to lesser power consumptions, users prefer buying devices integrated with the next-generation memory technologies as their expenses also get reduced. In addition, next-generation memory technologies have the unique feature of a faster wake-up time. They also eliminate the need for data saving and restoring, unlike other flash memories. This gives next-generation memory technologies an additional benefit over other RAMs, along with the advantage of lower power consumption. Next-generation memory technologies help in the automatic update of systems, especially in wireless applications. All these factors attract device manufacturers and end-users, which will drive the adoption of these technologies during the forecast period. Further, the report states that one challenges in market is cyclical nature of semiconductor industry. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry affects operating results of equipment vendors due to severe downturns. The equipment manufacturers face risks such as overcapacity, low demand, and high price competition. Changes in customer requirements due to new manufacturing capacity and advances in technology affect equipment manufacturers considerably. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment vendors are largely affected by their capital expenditure. Device manufacturers reduce their capital expenditure and demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment during the overcapacity period. During the cyclical period, there is a reduction in purchases, delay in delivery dates, and order cancellations by customers. This, in turn, results in reduction of net sales, backlogs, delays in revenue recognition, and excess inventory for the vendors, which poses a major threat to vendors’ operations. In addition, the high price competition due to their low demand in the market affects their gross margins. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Such technologies cover lightweight materials, in-vehicle digital entertainment and artificial intelligence. Chip giant Intel, Hi-Fi maker Dynaudio and search giant Baidu partnered with automakers to highlight their “young and future” cutting-edge technologies. Intel said yesterday that it will cooperate with domestic automaker Changan on the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and data center, as well as self-driving technologies. The chip giant has tied up with domestic software vendor Neusoft to tap the smart driving market to produce a system equipped with AI that can warn drivers when they are tired. By 2030, more than 120 million cars with smart driving technologies will be on the road, propelling the car to become the fastest growing connected device in future, analysts said. Hi-Fi maker Dynaudio said it will offer customized Hi-Fi devices for in-vehicle entertainment for Mercedes-Benz drivers in China. Dynaudio, which boasts clients like Bugatti Veyron and Volvo, aims to expand in-vehicle Hi-Fi services in China, whose market was worth 150 billion yuan (US$22 billion) in 2016, a 30 percent annual growth. Carbon fiber is set to become an alternative new material used in vehicles in three to five years, industry officials said.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Report: Intel Corporation to Build Another Mobile Chip for Spreadtrum This time, Chipzilla appears to be building a mass-market chip for the China-based smartphone chip vendor. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 20, 2017 at 10:30AM Per a fresh report from DIGITIMES, mobile chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications will yet again tap chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to manufacture a mobile-oriented system-on-a-chip. As DIGITIMES notes, Spreadtrum had previously announced a chip known as the SC9861G-IA that was also manufactured by Intel's contract chip manufacturing division, known as Intel Custom Foundry (ICF). Image source: Intel. The upcoming chip that Intel will manufacture for Spreadtrum is reportedly known as the SC9853, and DIGITIMES says that it should be released in the third quarter of this year. What does this mean for Spreadtrum and Intel? Let's take a closer look. Intel's back door into the mobile processor market Last year, Intel formally disclosed that it had cancelled its entire pipeline of announced mobile processors -- the SoFIA family of integrated applications processors and modems as well as a high-end chip known a Broxton, which did not include a cellular modem on the die. By pulling the plug on these projects, and significantly scaling back its efforts vis-a-vis mobile applications processors, Intel has been able to substantially reduce its operating expense structure, which improved profitability. However, Intel apparently doesn't want to be entirely out of the mobile applications processor loop. Recall that it purchased a 20% equity stake in Tsinghua Unigroup, a company that owns Spreadtrum as well as cellular modem maker RDA Microelectronics. The purchase was intended to be strategic: Not only would Intel own a piece of this company, but it would leverage its ownership stake to enable a collaboration between Intel and Spreadtrum to build chips targeted at the smartphone market. At the time, the deal was framed as Spreadtrum building chips based on Intel's core architecture designs with those chips also likely being manufactured in-house by Intel as soon as practicable. And, indeed, the very first fruit of Intel's and Spreadtrum's collaboration was just that -- a chip designed by Spreadtrum and manufactured by Intel, with Intel processor cores inside. Today, though, it appears that Intel is less interested in continuing to provide intellectual property to Spreadtrum such as processor cores and is more interested in simply having Spreadtrum manufacture its ARM-based chips at Intel. Such an arrangement allows Intel to participate in the smartphone market without the effort and risks associated with developing chips, platforms, and ultimately products. Instead, it relies on a company that knows what it's doing to handle all of that and simply makes money by selling manufacturing services. What do we know about this chip? All DIGITIMES has said about this upcoming chip is that it will be manufactured in Intel's 14-nanometer technology (Intel's best technology currently in production) and that it will be called the SC9853. Based on the model number, it appears that this upcoming chip will be a lower-end product than the SC9861G-IA that Intel is building for Spreadtrum (that chip is targeted at midrange and high-end smartphones, per Spreadtrum). Indeed, if I had to guess, I'd say that this is a successor to the SC9850 that Spreadtrum is currently selling. That chip has a quad core ARM Cortex A7 processor running at 1.3GHz, LTE support, ARM Mali 820MP1 graphics, support for 1080P video, and is manufactured in a 28-nanometer technology, per Spreadtrum's product page. Putting additional guesses out there, I'd imagine that the upcoming chip will see a migration from the ARM Cortex A7 processor (a 32-bit core) to the newer ARM Cortex A53 core (this is a widely used processor core in mobile phones). Due to the use of Intel's higher-performance 14-nanometer tech, I expect frequencies to be much higher than the 1.3 GHz that the A7 cores in the SC9850 run at. Beyond that, I expect upgraded graphics, multimedia, camera, and cellular capabilities -- the usual.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Samsung has announced that the second generation of its 10nm process is ready for production and the company is increasing its manufacturing capacity. The Snapdragon 835 and Exynos 8895 are built on 10nm LPE (Low Power Early). The second generation is called 10nm LPP (for Low Power Plus) and features enhancements to the 3D FinFET structure. The result is a 10% performance gain or a 15% power consumption reduction. We will probably see 10nm LPP used for the refreshed version of both the Snapdragon and Exynos top chips. Samsung is installing manufacturing equipment at its newest production line (S3 in Hwaseong, Korea), those will be ready to start cranking out chips in the final quarter of this year. An example of moving form LPE to LPP are the Galaxy S6 and S7 - the Exynos 7420 (S6) was built on 14nm LPE while the Exynos 8890 (S7) upgraded to 14nm LPP. However, the new process accounts for only some of the improvements. For example, the Snapdragon 820 and 821 were both built on the same 14nm LPP process, but the new one worked at higher clock speeds.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman EnergySage Releases Its Fourth Solar Marketplace Intel Report™ BOSTON, April 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — EnergySage published today its fourth semiannual Solar Marketplace Intel Report™, providing a comprehensive analysis of consumer behavior, demographics, and preferences, as well as a complete account of industry trends in the U.S. residential solar market in 2016. This latest edition of the industry-leading report presents several new datasets and analyses including an expanded list of new states, a review of the community solar landscape, and greater insights into solar shopper demographics. According to EnergySage data, the typical solar shopper is a mid-career male in his mid-40s with interests in real estate, financial services, and home services in addition to solar energy. This most recent report also features a new section analyzing residential solar data by utility territory. EnergySage compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar to today’s electricity rates in territories served by Commonwealth Edison Co., Consolidated Edison (ConEd), Dominion Power, Florida Power & Light Co., Southern California Edison, and Xcel Energy. In all service areas, the LCOE of solar is lower than the 2016 residential electricity rate offered by the utility, affirming the comparative benefits of solar as a low-cost energy source. Other key insights in the latest Solar Marketplace Intel Report include: Solar prices are falling at accelerating rate Between H1 2016 and H2 2016, gross cost per watt on EnergySage dropped by 6.25%. That is more than triple the rate of decline from the first EnergySage Solar Marketplace Intel Report from July 2014 to June 2015, and the greatest rate of decline measured in any of the reports to date. This trend may reflect improved operational efficiencies at solar companies, lower customer acquisition costs via online channels like EnergySage, increased competition, and the low cost of solar panels and inverters. More quotes result in more sales Consumers who receive offers from multiple solar installers are significantly more likely to complete a solar purchase. EnergySage users who received 5+ quotes in 2016 were nearly eight times more likely to buy than those who received only one quote. These results offer a clear message: quotes from multiple installers will increase consumer confidence, and solar shoppers should be encouraged to seek multiple quotes. Solar shoppers are mostly male EnergySage used Solar Marketplace demographic data to develop a profile of today’s solar-interested consumers, and found that three out of every four solar shoppers (77%) are male. This gender imbalance presents an opportunity for the solar industry to develop new messaging and outreach strategies to attract more female shoppers, and expand the product category to achieve true mass-market appeal. „This latest report speaks to the importance of transparency and comparison-shopping in residential solar,” said EnergySage CEO and founder Vikram Aggarwal. „For the consumer, getting more quotes empowers them to make better-informed decisions. For the installer, more quotes results in increased consumer confidence, which in turn results in a higher likelihood of purchase. Comparison-shopping platforms like EnergySage make win-win situations like this possible.”   EnergySage is the country’s leading online comparison-shopping marketplace for rooftop solar, community solar, and solar financing, and is uniquely positioned to share solar market insights. This report furthers EnergySage’s mission to support the healthy growth of the solar industry via consumer education and empowerment, price transparency, and greater information sharing among all stakeholders.

The German car giant reported pre-tax profits of 3bn euros (£2.5bn), a 27% jump from the same period in 2016. BMW said the value of the stake in Here had risen by 183m euros. The car manufacturer also cited improved earnings from its Chinese joint venture, BMW Brilliance Automotive, for its higher profits. The US chip giant Intel said in January it would buy 15% of Here, which is co-owned by Audi, BMW and Daimler. Here develops technology that feeds mapping information to autonomous and semi-autonomous cars. It also makes digital products that provide information on the location of upcoming hazards, traffic, road signs and charging points for electric vehicles, as well as an alternative positioning system to GPS. BMW is due to publish its detailed first-quarter results on 4 May.

Pretax profit jumped 27 percent to 3.01 billion euros ($3.23 billion) in the first quarter, more than expected even taking into account one-off gains that included 183 million euros from revaluing HERE after Intel invested in it. Mercedes-maker Daimler last week posted an 87 percent jump in quarterly operating profit, while Volkswagen on Tuesday reported a 28 percent rise, helped by a return to earnings growth at its core VW brand. "The European market, China and some emerging markets are developing much better than expected. Only the U.S. market is tougher," said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, explaining the strong results from German carmakers. He rates BMW shares "in line". German auto association VDA expects global car sales to rise 2 percent this year, driven by China where sales are seen rising by 6 percent, while demand in the United States and western Europe is seen stable. But European car sales leapt 10.9 percent in March, led by buoyant demand in the region's top five markets and extra selling days due to a late Easter this year that saw the holiday fall in April. Analysts were impressed by the extent to which BMW beat expectations, noting increased profits from Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive. "While this beat might seem moderate compared to the one seen at VW, it is actually slightly better than the one at Mercedes Benz Car division ... despite a less favourable product cycle," wrote Barclays analyst Kristina Church, who rates BMW "overweight/neutral". BMW shares were little changed at 1350 GMT. The revaluation of BMW's stake in HERE came as little surprise after Daimler - a co-owner together with Volkswagen - increased the valuation of its stake. Other valuation effects lifted BMW's financial result by a further 122 million euros. Intel said in January it was buying a 15 percent stake in HERE for an undisclosed sum, after Navinfo, Tencent and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in December. BMW affirmed its guidance for a slight increase in full-year group pretax profit and an operating margin of 8-10 percent at its automotive business, which posted a first-quarter margin of 9.0 percent, down from 9.4 percent a year earlier. BMW's sales rose 12 percent in the quarter to 23.5 billion euros, above the average analyst forecast of 22.1 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. The luxury carmaker is due to publish detailed first-quarter results on May 4.

Chuck Rego is Chief Architect for Intel. Over the last decade, huge growth in demand for Internet and mobile services has driven rapid transformation in digital businesses.  This growth has been highly disruptive, and it has created new business opportunities and challenged the status quo.  In the data center, two forces have created much of this change:  the evolution of virtualization and the rise of cloud computing. Latest-generation technologies in computing hardware and software platforms, including but not limited to unified computing, pervasive virtualization, containerization, new rack designs, disaggregation of compute resources, improved telemetry and analytics have all added to lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO) but also greater return on investment (ROI).  This has set the stage for agile infrastructure and a further explosion in the number and type of instrumentation metrics available to today’s data center managers. Optimization, as applied to data centers, means always having the right amount of resources, to cost-effectively enable the business use of those data centers. Right resourcing means, in effect, enough to get the data center “job” done, but not so much as to waste money. Everything from enough power and floor space to enough “computes,” and everything else. Easily said, but increasingly challenging to accomplish. It used to be that one would optimize any given data center resource by measuring resource utilization; for example, how busy a CPU is, and then make a considered determination of what level was sufficiently busy to be upgraded or extended, or sufficiently non-busy to warrant consolidation. This approach was used, and useful, for everything from CPUs, memory and other server metrics, to things like power consumption, where metrics like PUE (power utilization effectiveness) were created and applied. However, these types of optimizations were always done in domain isolation – silos in effect. On the software side, pervasive virtualization, containerization and software automation have completely changed the measurement landscape. The increasingly rich metrics embedded in server chipsets open exciting new possibilities. Metric That Matters #1: Transaction Throughput and Response Time Because high levels of virtualization abstract the real hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) from the workloads using them, and those resources are ever more dynamically allocated to the workloads running upon them, the measurement of specific resource utilization is becoming increasing unrelated to how those workloads actually perform. This has driven an explosion in the adoption of Application Performance Management (APM) solutions that measure how much work applications are getting done and how quickly they are responding. This, at the end of the day is one of the key metrics of today’s data centers: how much business work is being accomplished and how responsively.  And, where such metrics are simply not available, reasonable proxies need to be found; typically anything that can measure “waiting” in and across the environment. Metric That Matters #2: Cost – Especially OpEx In a perfect world, one would be able to completely cost-optimize the entirety of the infrastructure used to deliver applications and services in an acceptably performant fashion. In other words, if each and every transaction is simultaneously cost AND performance optimized, and, importantly can be kept in that state, then one has reached the pinnacle of data center optimization. This implies a need to have a good basis for OpEx costing; a mechanism by which to allocate/ascribe a cost measure to transactions.   Again, because of the dynamic complexity of the environment when considering the “map” from transactions to the underlying supporting infrastructure, some type of management framework is clearly required to accurately accomplish this allocation. To be useful, system management frameworks need to be as dynamic and scalable as their underlying systems.  Management tools built on industry standards and open source reference implementations provide powerful automation solutions that increase performance, boost efficiency, and speed time to market.  New power and cooling management and metrics provide monitoring, optimization and prediction, capabilities all leading to reduced cost of ownership. Research now suggests that in many real world applications, storage performance is the main limiter of application performance.  New rack designs enable large gains in storage performance and cost without imposing a significant cost burden.  Like compute and network resources, storage resources are now increasingly software defined. Over the last few years, quantum leaps in technology and telemetry availability has provided excellent proxies for determining costs.  Metrics such as dollar-per-watt, power-per-transaction, dollar-per-VM, performance-per-watt, and many other performance metrics provide details in the actual operational expense of running the data center. Summary The closer that data centers can get to complete instrumentation of important metrics like transactional response time and throughput, the lower the overall associated costs will be to successfully deliver those business services, and the more efficient such data centers can become.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Scroll down to content Posts Posted on 21 April 2017 3 Questions: Jeanne Guillemin on the recent chemical attack in Syria On April 4, a suspected nerve gas attack killed at least 80 in Khan Sheikhun, in Syria’s Idlib Province. Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and the current UN Security Council president, stated shortly after the incident that members „are hoping to get as much information” as they can about the event. Jeanne Guillemin, a medical anthropologist and a senior fellow in the MIT Security Studies Program, recently answered a few questions on the attack. Guillemin is an authority on biological weapons and has published four books on the topic. Her latest, „Hidden Atrocities: Japanese Germ Warfare and American Obstruction of Justice at the Tokyo Trial,” will be published by Columbia University Press in September. Q. What do we now know about the attack? A. The process of investigation will be difficult, given the ongoing war and secrecy on the part of Syria and others. It seems certain that the regime of Syria’s President al-Assad or some element thereof not only violated treaty obligations regarding chemical weapons but could be complicit in a major war crime. On a technical level, the chemical agent that caused more than 80 deaths and many injuries has been identified by the United Kingdom as sarin, which accords with medical records. The timing of the attack was April 4 at just before 7 a.m. local time, optimal for dispersal. Much less or nothing is reliably known regarding the munition and its source. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the operational arm of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in The Hague, is the lead agency for investigating the nerve gas attack. The OPCW can count on assistance from the United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), created by the Security Council with all permanent members in agreement. OPCW investigations are kept secret until the final reports are released, which can take months, and their mandate does not extend to identifying perpetrators. The mandate of the JIM is broader and does extend to estimating perpetrators, which makes its eventual report important. Q. Based on your expertise on the historical use of chemical weapons, why would Assad strike now? Is he likely to strike again? A. The use of chemical weapons in war, starting in April 1915 with the German release of chlorine gas on Allied trenches at Ypres, has invariably been to break an impasse by targeting a defenseless enemy, those lacking protection such as gas masks or antidotes. For Syria, frustration with rebel holdouts in Idlib Province may have provoked the attack; one wonders, though, exactly what authorities reasoned that killing civilians with nerve gas could be carried out without controversy — and without jeopardizing the new potential for cooperation with the Trump administration. The political furor created by the social media images of the victims make it unlikely that President al-Assad, if he ordered or permitted the attacks, would venture any more. For years, though, Syria has been getting a pass from the international community regarding its less-than-complete compliance with the CWC, to which it acceded in October 2013. In 2014, the belief that Syria’s declaration of its chemical weapons contained gaps and inconsistencies prompted the Director-General of the OPCW to send a special team of technical investigators on 18 trips to Syria to do what proved impossible: to verify that Syria’s declaration was in accordance with the CWC. The UN Security Council was fully advised of OPCW reports, but no action was taken to bring Syria in line. Currently the Russian government is taking al-Assad’s protestations of innocence at face value. At the same time, though, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has spoken strongly in favor of UN investigations and asserted that Syria will be forthcoming about its military activities in the region at the time of the April 4 sarin attack. If evidence points clearly to al-Assad’s forces, which the U.S. government has already publicly blamed, Putin will have to address the difficult problem of regime change in Syria — or risk his own legitimacy by supporting a Syrian president many feel is at best a loose cannon and at worst the murderer of his own people.   Q. What are psychological and physical effects of this kind of attack, and how does one determine who was responsible? A. Follow-up information from the 1988 chemical attack in Halabja, Iraq, and the 2013 chemical attack in Ghouta, Syria, illustrates the terrifying impact of aerial chemical attacks on defenseless populations already under siege. In Halabja, the attacks with blistering mustard and with sarin, combined with conventional bombings, were part of Saddam Hussein’s punitive objective to eliminate the Kurds from Iraq. The unusual strikes on Ghouta and Khan Sheikhun seem more intended to terrify Syrian civilians, that is, to frighten survivors and witnesses (even those watching on the internet) into submission to the enemy aggressor, whose power to rapidly asphyxiate hundreds must seem mythic, especially when done with impunity, without legal repercussions. Over time, the criminal responsibility for the April 4 sarin attack might be put on Syrian officials, who may well be prosecuted at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The court’s statute contains language banning the use of poisons taken directly from the Geneva Protocol; the prosecution of murderous attacks on defenseless populations is, of course, central to the ICC mission, regardless of means. The broader responsibility for what has happened in Syria and for the extreme vulnerability of its civilian population throughout the war lies with the international community. This week, one hears the Chinese delegate to the United Nations calling for a political solution, rather than a military showdown between the United States and Russia. After this latest barbarism, is it too much to ask for international safe zones and a cease fire? Posted on 21 April 2017 Russia: Court Bans Jehovahs Witnesses (Moscow) – Russia’s Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah’s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia’s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom. The Justice Ministry, which had petitioned the Supreme Court to close the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization, should withdraw the case and refrain from taking further measures that violate its obligations to respect the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization’s right to freedom of religion and to association. The Jehovah’s Witnesses organization said it will appeal the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights. Yaroslav Sivulsky, member of the managerial center of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, gives an interview after the court hearing in the Supreme Court on April 7, 2017, Moscow. © 2017 Dmitry Tischenko/www.jw-russia.org “The Supreme Court’s ruling to shut down the Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia is a terrible blow to freedom of religion and association in Russia,” said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia are now given the heartrending choice of either abandoning their faith or facing punishment for practicing it.” The ruling declares the Jehovah’s Witnesses Administrative Center an extremist organization, closes the organization on those grounds, and bans all Jehovah’s Witnesses’ activities. The Jehovah’s Witnesses Administrative Center is the head office for 395 Jehovah’s Witnesses branches throughout Russia. If the ruling enters into force, people who continue to be involved with Jehovah’s Witnesses organization or their activities in Russia could face criminal prosecution and punishment ranging from fines of 300,00 to 600,000 rubles (US$5,343 to $10,687) to a maximum of six to 10 years in prison. People found to be leading such activity would face a maximum 10 years. The organization’s property will be confiscated. Jehovah’s Witnesses will not be able to congregate for worship at their church or anywhere else. People waiting for the Supreme Court decision in front of the Supreme Court building in Moscow, on April 7, 2017. © 2017 Dmitry Tischenko/www.jw-russia.org According to the Justice Ministry, since 2007, local courts have banned at least eight local Jehovah’s Witnesses organizations, and 95 pieces of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ literature have been banned and placed on the federal registry of banned extremist materials. In most cases the ban was triggered by claims in the literature of the superiority over other religions of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ interpretation of the Bible. Anyone found with large quantities of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ banned materials can be held responsible for the misdemeanor offense of distributing “extremist” materials. The Justice Ministry case followed an unannounced inspection, started in February 2017, of the Jehovah’s Witnesses Administrative Center in St. Petersburg. The inspection found that the Administrative Center had continued to fund branches that had been closed after a court banned them for extremism. It also found the organization had taken no action to change “extremist” literature and had continued to distribute it. Jehovah’s Witnesses have vigorously denied the latter allegation. The Justice Ministry suspended all Jehovah’s Witnesses’ activities when the ministry filed its lawsuit on March 15. Members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses Managerial Center during the court hearing in the Supreme Court of Russia, April 5, 2017. © 2017 Dmitry Tischenko/www.jw-russia.org A member of the Council of Europe and a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, Russia is obligated to protect freedom of religion and association. It has previously been found in violation of multiple obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights for actions taken through the courts to dissolve communities of Jehovah’s Witnesses (Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow v. Russia, application no. 302/02). The April 20 ruling to close the Jehovah’s Witnesses is a direct interference with freedom of religion, effectively denying its followers the right to worship, and cannot be justified as either necessary or proportionate. The closure order directly violates the pluralism of thought and belief that is foundational to a democratic society and as the court has repeatedly affirmed, is “at the very heart of the protection which [the convention] affords.” “It’s not too late for the Russian authorities to make right this serious move against religious freedom,” Denber said. “The Justice Ministry should withdraw the suit against the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization and stop interfering with group’s peaceful religious activity.” Posted on 21 April 2017 Petroleum demand last month highest for March since 2008 (includes monthly statistical report) Printer-friendly version Sabrina Fang 202.682.8114 WASHINGTON, April 20, 2017 – Total petroleum deliveries in March moved up 0.2 percent from March 2016 to average nearly 19.7 million barrels per day. These were the highest March deliveries in nine years, since 2008. For the first quarter of 2017, total domestic petroleum deliveries, a measure of U.S. petroleum demand, were up 0.4 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016 to average 19.5 million barrels per day. These were the highest first quarter deliveries since 2008. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) April 7, 2017 report, the U.S. added 98,000 jobs in March. In addition, the unemployment rate (4.5 percent) and the number of unemployed persons (7.2 million) were down from prior month and the prior year. Gasoline deliveries, a measure of consumer gasoline demand, in March were up from the prior month, but down from the prior year, and the prior first quarter. Total motor gasoline deliveries increased 4.3 percent from February, but were down 1.7 percent from March 2016 to average 9.2 million barrels per day. These were the second highest March deliveries ever recorded. “The strong steady demand for fuel expanded economic activity in the manufacturing sector last month and the overall economy grew for the 94th consecutive month. Good news for workers and the economy,” said Chief Economist, Erica Bowman. U.S. crude oil production increased for the third month straight in 2017 by 1.4 percent, but posted declines compared to the prior year, and the prior first quarter levels. At an average of 9.2 million barrels per day, U.S. crude oil production decreased 0.2 percent from March 2016, and was down 1.8 percent from the first quarter of 2016. Natural gas liquids (NGL) production, a co-product of natural gas production, was up from the prior month and the prior first quarter, but was down from the prior year. NGL production in March averaged 3.4 million barrels per day, which was the second highest level for the month on record. This was 0.4 percent above February’s output and 0.8 percent higher than the first quarter of 2016. U.S. total petroleum imports in March averaged nearly 10.0 million barrels per day. This was the second highest March total petroleum imports level in five years, since 2012. Total petroleum imports were down 3.8 percent from the prior month, and down 0.1 percent compared with the prior year. For the first quarter of 2017, total petroleum imports were up 4.4 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016.

Their first three operational priorities are Africa, South/Central America, and some parts of Asia. And then they will expand to the rest of the world. Conscious of the challenges ahead when it comes to IP, legal and operational structure Humaniq is preparing for its next challenges. The organisation has recently conducting pilot tech projects in India and is starting in Africa in the next few months, while managing its ICO that raised so far over $3.8M. Deloitte is a global powerhouse in auditing, legal, IP and a driver in blockchain identity technology, making it the right auditing and innovation firm to manage Humaniq’s structure and operational efforts in multiple countries and locations. Humaniq aims to repurpose science and technology for the good of the world. The beta version of their fintech application was recently launched in Google Play for Android phones and simply requires a new user to register using their biometric identity by snapping a photo through a face-recognition algorithm. The Humaniq application uses minimum language as it wants to be based on a simple user-interface and symbols, highlighting its international focus through the use of emoticons. This makes it simple to use even for the most illiterate people in the world. Humaniq will bring a great number of unbanked people into the world economy, enabling financial inclusion. One example of the Humaniq app’s benefits is a case-study of a Nigerian farmer who lives ninety miles away from the closest bank. Furthermore, he does not have a vehicle or any ID verification to access or open a new bank account. Humaniq enables this farmer to sell his corns or peppers and buy new seeds on an international scale, as long as he has a simple smartphone and basic access to the internet. And all of this happens for a fraction of the fee when compared with traditional banks or money-transfer companies. In a recent HBR report, Professor Michael Mainelli wrote; „2.4 billion poor people worldwide, about 1.5 billion of whom are over the age of 14, can‚t answer that question to the satisfaction of authorities. While they certainly know who they are, they are often excluded from property ownership, free movement, and social protection simply because they can‚t prove their identity. They are more exposed to corruption and crime, including people trafficking and slavery.„  In addition to enabling financial inclusion, Humaniq also aims to provide biometric identity to tackle serious issues such as human trafficking and modern slavery. So far Humaniq has raised just under $4m in its pre-seed Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which ends on 27th April 2017. While announcing a strategic partnership with global auditing firm Deloitte, Humaniq wants to highlight their intellectual property and legal efforts with a powerful global company. In addition to the aforementioned, Deloitte will also provide industry-leading audit, consulting, tax, and advisory support to Humaniq. Many of the world’s most admired brands including eighty-percent of the Fortune 500 work closely with Deloitte. Co-founded by blockchain technology visionaire Alex Fork and AI expert Dmitry Kaminskiy, Humaniq is breaking international crowdfunding records with a total value of $3,949,131 and 9,189 participants at the time of writing. Steering the wheel as CEO of this powerful new organisation is successful blockchain/fintech author and entrepreneur Dinis Guarda. In addition to the board of directors previously mentioned, Humaniq also has a world-class advisory board consisting of over twenty global thought-leaders. This includes people and alumni from organisations such as The Financial Times, The United Nations, Greenpeace, Right Relevance, University of Toronto, Cambridge University, and Save the Children to name just a few. Through this new partnership, Humaniq and Deloitte ultimately want to help establish sustainable and structured operations to enable more financial inclusion, justice and strong institutions on a global scale.

Giving Ms. Swanson these powers is like letting police write their own warrants to search people’s private papers and emails protected by the Fourth Amendment, while currying political favors or satisfying ideological grudges in the process.” Among the various FOIA requests that Swanson’s Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Velzen refused to answer in an April 14 denial of the FOIA requests submitted February 27 and supplemented on March 2 was: How many attorneys or other staff in the Office of the Attorney General are related by blood or marriage to the Attorney General, any former Attorney General, any statewide public official in Minnesota, or any member of the Minnesota state legislature?  Please provide their names, the names of the officials, and the nature of the relationship to the official. Swanson employs Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth Kremenak, the daughter of Swanson’s mentor, former Minnesota Attorney General and failed gubernatorial candidate Mike Hatch. It is not known to the public if she employs others who create conflicts of interest with her broad powers and obligation to be impartial. Swanson’s office also refused to respond to FOIA requests about how many civil investigative demands („CIDs”) it has issued since 2013 to businesses and nonprofit organizations, how many CIDs demanded the names of donors to nonprofit organizations (in violation of the 1958 landmark Supreme Court decision in NAACP v. Alabama), and what training its lawyers receive about protecting constitutional rights. Among its excuses, Swanson’s office claims the information is subject to an „attorney-client privilege” and is „classified as not public data.” CIDs are searches for documents issued without probable cause presented under oath and affirmation before neutral judges or magistrates, and are increasingly being questioned as violations of the Fourth Amendment and the constitutional separation of powers. See David Kravets, „We Don’t Need No Stinking Warrant: The Disturbing, Unchecked Rise of the Administrative Subpoena,” Wired.com, August 28, 2012, https://www.wired.com/2012/08/administrative-subpoenas/. Swanson is part of the combination of liberal state attorneys general called the „Green 20” that collaborated to target and investigate entities with dissenting opinions about climate change causes and policies. She has been subpoenaed by a congressional committee for her involvement in this possibly illegal combination looking to stifle First Amendment rights. Last November a New York judge ordered disclosure of the „common interest” secrecy pact and emails between these attorneys general after a similar denial of a FOIA request was litigated.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Scroll down to content Posts Posted on 21 April 2017 3 Questions: Jeanne Guillemin on the recent chemical attack in Syria On April 4, a suspected nerve gas attack killed at least 80 in Khan Sheikhun, in Syria’s Idlib Province. Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and the current UN Security Council president, stated shortly after the incident that members „are hoping to get as much information” as they can about the event. Jeanne Guillemin, a medical anthropologist and a senior fellow in the MIT Security Studies Program, recently answered a few questions on the attack. Guillemin is an authority on biological weapons and has published four books on the topic. Her latest, „Hidden Atrocities: Japanese Germ Warfare and American Obstruction of Justice at the Tokyo Trial,” will be published by Columbia University Press in September. Q. What do we now know about the attack? A. The process of investigation will be difficult, given the ongoing war and secrecy on the part of Syria and others. It seems certain that the regime of Syria’s President al-Assad or some element thereof not only violated treaty obligations regarding chemical weapons but could be complicit in a major war crime. On a technical level, the chemical agent that caused more than 80 deaths and many injuries has been identified by the United Kingdom as sarin, which accords with medical records. The timing of the attack was April 4 at just before 7 a.m. local time, optimal for dispersal. Much less or nothing is reliably known regarding the munition and its source. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the operational arm of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in The Hague, is the lead agency for investigating the nerve gas attack. The OPCW can count on assistance from the United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), created by the Security Council with all permanent members in agreement. OPCW investigations are kept secret until the final reports are released, which can take months, and their mandate does not extend to identifying perpetrators. The mandate of the JIM is broader and does extend to estimating perpetrators, which makes its eventual report important. Q. Based on your expertise on the historical use of chemical weapons, why would Assad strike now? Is he likely to strike again? A. The use of chemical weapons in war, starting in April 1915 with the German release of chlorine gas on Allied trenches at Ypres, has invariably been to break an impasse by targeting a defenseless enemy, those lacking protection such as gas masks or antidotes. For Syria, frustration with rebel holdouts in Idlib Province may have provoked the attack; one wonders, though, exactly what authorities reasoned that killing civilians with nerve gas could be carried out without controversy — and without jeopardizing the new potential for cooperation with the Trump administration. The political furor created by the social media images of the victims make it unlikely that President al-Assad, if he ordered or permitted the attacks, would venture any more. For years, though, Syria has been getting a pass from the international community regarding its less-than-complete compliance with the CWC, to which it acceded in October 2013. In 2014, the belief that Syria’s declaration of its chemical weapons contained gaps and inconsistencies prompted the Director-General of the OPCW to send a special team of technical investigators on 18 trips to Syria to do what proved impossible: to verify that Syria’s declaration was in accordance with the CWC. The UN Security Council was fully advised of OPCW reports, but no action was taken to bring Syria in line. Currently the Russian government is taking al-Assad’s protestations of innocence at face value. At the same time, though, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has spoken strongly in favor of UN investigations and asserted that Syria will be forthcoming about its military activities in the region at the time of the April 4 sarin attack. If evidence points clearly to al-Assad’s forces, which the U.S. government has already publicly blamed, Putin will have to address the difficult problem of regime change in Syria — or risk his own legitimacy by supporting a Syrian president many feel is at best a loose cannon and at worst the murderer of his own people.   Q. What are psychological and physical effects of this kind of attack, and how does one determine who was responsible? A. Follow-up information from the 1988 chemical attack in Halabja, Iraq, and the 2013 chemical attack in Ghouta, Syria, illustrates the terrifying impact of aerial chemical attacks on defenseless populations already under siege. In Halabja, the attacks with blistering mustard and with sarin, combined with conventional bombings, were part of Saddam Hussein’s punitive objective to eliminate the Kurds from Iraq. The unusual strikes on Ghouta and Khan Sheikhun seem more intended to terrify Syrian civilians, that is, to frighten survivors and witnesses (even those watching on the internet) into submission to the enemy aggressor, whose power to rapidly asphyxiate hundreds must seem mythic, especially when done with impunity, without legal repercussions. Over time, the criminal responsibility for the April 4 sarin attack might be put on Syrian officials, who may well be prosecuted at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The court’s statute contains language banning the use of poisons taken directly from the Geneva Protocol; the prosecution of murderous attacks on defenseless populations is, of course, central to the ICC mission, regardless of means. The broader responsibility for what has happened in Syria and for the extreme vulnerability of its civilian population throughout the war lies with the international community. This week, one hears the Chinese delegate to the United Nations calling for a political solution, rather than a military showdown between the United States and Russia. After this latest barbarism, is it too much to ask for international safe zones and a cease fire? Posted on 21 April 2017 Russia: Court Bans Jehovahs Witnesses (Moscow) – Russia’s Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah’s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia’s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom. The Justice Ministry, which had petitioned the Supreme Court to close the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization, should withdraw the case and refrain from taking further measures that violate its obligations to respect the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization’s right to freedom of religion and to association. The Jehovah’s Witnesses organization said it will appeal the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights. Yaroslav Sivulsky, member of the managerial center of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, gives an interview after the court hearing in the Supreme Court on April 7, 2017, Moscow. © 2017 Dmitry Tischenko/www.jw-russia.org “The Supreme Court’s ruling to shut down the Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia is a terrible blow to freedom of religion and association in Russia,” said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia are now given the heartrending choice of either abandoning their faith or facing punishment for practicing it.” The ruling declares the Jehovah’s Witnesses Administrative Center an extremist organization, closes the organization on those grounds, and bans all Jehovah’s Witnesses’ activities. The Jehovah’s Witnesses Administrative Center is the head office for 395 Jehovah’s Witnesses branches throughout Russia. If the ruling enters into force, people who continue to be involved with Jehovah’s Witnesses organization or their activities in Russia could face criminal prosecution and punishment ranging from fines of 300,00 to 600,000 rubles (US$5,343 to $10,687) to a maximum of six to 10 years in prison. People found to be leading such activity would face a maximum 10 years. The organization’s property will be confiscated. Jehovah’s Witnesses will not be able to congregate for worship at their church or anywhere else. People waiting for the Supreme Court decision in front of the Supreme Court building in Moscow, on April 7, 2017. © 2017 Dmitry Tischenko/www.jw-russia.org According to the Justice Ministry, since 2007, local courts have banned at least eight local Jehovah’s Witnesses organizations, and 95 pieces of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ literature have been banned and placed on the federal registry of banned extremist materials. In most cases the ban was triggered by claims in the literature of the superiority over other religions of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ interpretation of the Bible. Anyone found with large quantities of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ banned materials can be held responsible for the misdemeanor offense of distributing “extremist” materials. The Justice Ministry case followed an unannounced inspection, started in February 2017, of the Jehovah’s Witnesses Administrative Center in St. Petersburg. The inspection found that the Administrative Center had continued to fund branches that had been closed after a court banned them for extremism. It also found the organization had taken no action to change “extremist” literature and had continued to distribute it. Jehovah’s Witnesses have vigorously denied the latter allegation. The Justice Ministry suspended all Jehovah’s Witnesses’ activities when the ministry filed its lawsuit on March 15. Members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses Managerial Center during the court hearing in the Supreme Court of Russia, April 5, 2017. © 2017 Dmitry Tischenko/www.jw-russia.org A member of the Council of Europe and a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, Russia is obligated to protect freedom of religion and association. It has previously been found in violation of multiple obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights for actions taken through the courts to dissolve communities of Jehovah’s Witnesses (Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow v. Russia, application no. 302/02). The April 20 ruling to close the Jehovah’s Witnesses is a direct interference with freedom of religion, effectively denying its followers the right to worship, and cannot be justified as either necessary or proportionate. The closure order directly violates the pluralism of thought and belief that is foundational to a democratic society and as the court has repeatedly affirmed, is “at the very heart of the protection which [the convention] affords.” “It’s not too late for the Russian authorities to make right this serious move against religious freedom,” Denber said. “The Justice Ministry should withdraw the suit against the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization and stop interfering with group’s peaceful religious activity.” Posted on 21 April 2017 Petroleum demand last month highest for March since 2008 (includes monthly statistical report) Printer-friendly version Sabrina Fang 202.682.8114 WASHINGTON, April 20, 2017 – Total petroleum deliveries in March moved up 0.2 percent from March 2016 to average nearly 19.7 million barrels per day. These were the highest March deliveries in nine years, since 2008. For the first quarter of 2017, total domestic petroleum deliveries, a measure of U.S. petroleum demand, were up 0.4 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016 to average 19.5 million barrels per day. These were the highest first quarter deliveries since 2008. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) April 7, 2017 report, the U.S. added 98,000 jobs in March. In addition, the unemployment rate (4.5 percent) and the number of unemployed persons (7.2 million) were down from prior month and the prior year. Gasoline deliveries, a measure of consumer gasoline demand, in March were up from the prior month, but down from the prior year, and the prior first quarter. Total motor gasoline deliveries increased 4.3 percent from February, but were down 1.7 percent from March 2016 to average 9.2 million barrels per day. These were the second highest March deliveries ever recorded. “The strong steady demand for fuel expanded economic activity in the manufacturing sector last month and the overall economy grew for the 94th consecutive month. Good news for workers and the economy,” said Chief Economist, Erica Bowman. U.S. crude oil production increased for the third month straight in 2017 by 1.4 percent, but posted declines compared to the prior year, and the prior first quarter levels. At an average of 9.2 million barrels per day, U.S. crude oil production decreased 0.2 percent from March 2016, and was down 1.8 percent from the first quarter of 2016.

April mit einem Beitrag über Rindfleischnudeln aus Lanzhou, der Hauptstadt der Provinz Gansu im Nordwesten Chinas. Foto – http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/492304/6_for_US.jpg Posted on 21 April 2017 Blockchain Technology Startup Humaniq Raises $3.8M and Signs Contract With Deloitte LONDON, April 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Blockchain technology startup Humaniq and global auditing firm Deloitte join forces.      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/492568/Humaniq_Logo.jpg ) Humaniq is on a mission to provide financial inclusion products and services powered by blockchain technology to the 2 billion unbanked people across the globe. Their first three operational priorities are Africa, South/Central America, and some parts of Asia. And then they will expand to the rest of the world. Conscious of the challenges ahead when it comes to IP, legal and operational structure Humaniq is preparing for its next challenges. The organisation has recently conducting pilot tech projects in India and is starting in Africa in the next few months, while managing its ICO that raised so far over $3.8M. Deloitte is a global powerhouse in auditing, legal, IP and a driver in blockchain identity technology, making it the right auditing and innovation firm to manage Humaniq’s structure and operational efforts in multiple countries and locations. Humaniq aims to repurpose science and technology for the good of the world. The beta version of their fintech application was recently launched in Google Play for Android phones and simply requires a new user to register using their biometric identity by snapping a photo through a face-recognition algorithm. The Humaniq application uses minimum language as it wants to be based on a simple user-interface and symbols, highlighting its international focus through the use of emoticons. This makes it simple to use even for the most illiterate people in the world. Humaniq will bring a great number of unbanked people into the world economy, enabling financial inclusion. One example of the Humaniq app’s benefits is a case-study of a Nigerian farmer who lives ninety miles away from the closest bank. Furthermore, he does not have a vehicle or any ID verification to access or open a new bank account. Humaniq enables this farmer to sell his corns or peppers and buy new seeds on an international scale, as long as he has a simple smartphone and basic access to the internet. And all of this happens for a fraction of the fee when compared with traditional banks or money-transfer companies. In a recent HBR report, Professor Michael Mainelli wrote; „2.4 billion poor people worldwide, about 1.5 billion of whom are over the age of 14, can‚t answer that question to the satisfaction of authorities. While they certainly know who they are, they are often excluded from property ownership, free movement, and social protection simply because they can‚t prove their identity. They are more exposed to corruption and crime, including people trafficking and slavery.„  In addition to enabling financial inclusion, Humaniq also aims to provide biometric identity to tackle serious issues such as human trafficking and modern slavery. So far Humaniq has raised just under $4m in its pre-seed Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which ends on 27th April 2017. While announcing a strategic partnership with global auditing firm Deloitte, Humaniq wants to highlight their intellectual property and legal efforts with a powerful global company. In addition to the aforementioned, Deloitte will also provide industry-leading audit, consulting, tax, and advisory support to Humaniq. Many of the world’s most admired brands including eighty-percent of the Fortune 500 work closely with Deloitte. Co-founded by blockchain technology visionaire Alex Fork and AI expert Dmitry Kaminskiy, Humaniq is breaking international crowdfunding records with a total value of $3,949,131 and 9,189 participants at the time of writing. Steering the wheel as CEO of this powerful new organisation is successful blockchain/fintech author and entrepreneur Dinis Guarda. In addition to the board of directors previously mentioned, Humaniq also has a world-class advisory board consisting of over twenty global thought-leaders. This includes people and alumni from organisations such as The Financial Times, The United Nations, Greenpeace, Right Relevance, University of Toronto, Cambridge University, and Save the Children to name just a few. Through this new partnership, Humaniq and Deloitte ultimately want to help establish sustainable and structured operations to enable more financial inclusion, justice and strong institutions on a global scale. SOURCE Humaniq Posted on 21 April 2017 American Target Advertising, Inc.: MN AG Swanson Refuses to Disclose Nepotism and More MANASSAS, Va., April 20, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Mark Fitzgibbons, President of Corporate Affairs at American Target Advertising, America’s largest and oldest conservative direct response agency, issued the following statement today following the refusal by the Office of Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson to answer Freedom of Information Act („FOIA”) requests about nepotism within her office, and the quantity of judgeless warrants called civil investigative demands (also known as administrative subpoenas) issued by her: „The type of information that Ms. Swanson has refused to provide in response to my FOIA request should already be available to the general public, yet Ms. Swanson’s office has now taken the position that it will require litigation to force transparency,” said Fitzgibbons, who added, „Ms. Swanson’s obstruction combines darkness, potential conflicts of interest, and danger to constitutional rights, making her unworthy of the unchecked, unilateral search and enforcement powers she wields. Giving Ms. Swanson these powers is like letting police write their own warrants to search people’s private papers and emails protected by the Fourth Amendment, while currying political favors or satisfying ideological grudges in the process.” Among the various FOIA requests that Swanson’s Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Velzen refused to answer in an April 14 denial of the FOIA requests submitted February 27 and supplemented on March 2 was: How many attorneys or other staff in the Office of the Attorney General are related by blood or marriage to the Attorney General, any former Attorney General, any statewide public official in Minnesota, or any member of the Minnesota state legislature?  Please provide their names, the names of the officials, and the nature of the relationship to the official. Swanson employs Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth Kremenak, the daughter of Swanson’s mentor, former Minnesota Attorney General and failed gubernatorial candidate Mike Hatch. It is not known to the public if she employs others who create conflicts of interest with her broad powers and obligation to be impartial. Swanson’s office also refused to respond to FOIA requests about how many civil investigative demands („CIDs”) it has issued since 2013 to businesses and nonprofit organizations, how many CIDs demanded the names of donors to nonprofit organizations (in violation of the 1958 landmark Supreme Court decision in NAACP v. Alabama), and what training its lawyers receive about protecting constitutional rights. Among its excuses, Swanson’s office claims the information is subject to an „attorney-client privilege” and is „classified as not public data.” CIDs are searches for documents issued without probable cause presented under oath and affirmation before neutral judges or magistrates, and are increasingly being questioned as violations of the Fourth Amendment and the constitutional separation of powers. See David Kravets, „We Don’t Need No Stinking Warrant: The Disturbing, Unchecked Rise of the Administrative Subpoena,” Wired.com, August 28, 2012, https://www.wired.com/2012/08/administrative-subpoenas/. Swanson is part of the combination of liberal state attorneys general called the „Green 20” that collaborated to target and investigate entities with dissenting opinions about climate change causes and policies. She has been subpoenaed by a congressional committee for her involvement in this possibly illegal combination looking to stifle First Amendment rights. Last November a New York judge ordered disclosure of the „common interest” secrecy pact and emails between these attorneys general after a similar denial of a FOIA request was litigated.

It tried to convince hardware partners to invest in tablets running Windows for years. That didn’t work. Instead, it got into the market itself with Surface. 2015 wasn’t the first year we got a glimpse of a Surface Pro. It was the year that Microsoft perfected the Windows 2-in-1 with the Surface Pro 4. 2017 could be the year we get an even better Surface Pro 5. The Surface Pro 4 launched with Microsoft’s massive Windows 10 operating system update. It was a testbed for all sorts of new technologies. It came with Intel Skylake processors, infrared cameras for sign in, updated digital pen technology and a 12-inch high-resolution display that offered amazing colors. The Surface Pro 5, if it’s announced and released this year, could be as equally forward thinking as the Surface Pro 4 was. Microsoft uses Surface to prove concepts that it hopes hardware makers will attempt with their own designs. The Surface Pro 5 release can’t be too far off now. Read: 11 Surface Pro 4 Tips & Tricks Some are saying that the Surface Pro 5 release could mean the end of the device’s signature charging and docking port. These reports point to the tablet adopting a new port that’s already seeing widespread adoption in smartphones. Others believe that the Surface Pro 5 will include only rudimentary updates designed to help it better compete against the iPad Pro and devices that copied the Surface Pro 4’s design. They predict a modest update to its processor and memory. A Surface Pro 5 release is definitely happening. Microsoft has been on a hot streak with the line, releasing the Surface Book and Surface Studio in quick succession to help establish new areas for growth. Those devices are gaining mind share, but the Surface Pro is the most popular computer Microsoft makes by far. Read: Microsoft Surface: Everything New in 2016 The Surface Pro 5 release is coming. Here’s what we know. Surface Pro 5 Release Date The Surface Pro 5 release date hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s a generally agreed upon window that’s coming into focus. The Surface Pro 4 was revealed at an event in October 2015. Microsoft generally aims to replace a device around 13 months. The only exception to this is the Surface Pro 3, which effectively established the Surface Pro as a productivity powerhouse in the first place. The Surface Pro 4 just hit the 18-month mark of availability, roughly. Read: Surface Book vs Surface Pro 4 When a new piece of hardware is about to be released, Microsoft schedules an event. The last few events have focused on both hardware and software. That is, the company likes to give users a look at the entire package together. The company recently sent out invites to an education-focused event on May 2nd. It is believed that Microsoft will discuss a new Surface at this event. All About Microsoft believes this will be an all-new Surface form factor to show off Windows 10 Cloud, not a Surface Pro 5. Microsoft reveals the Surface Pro 4. It is worth noting that the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book launches came around the same time as Microsoft released a major update to Windows 10. The Windows 10 Creators Update launched in early April. The next major update to Windows likely won’t come until late in 2017. It’s in early development now. Surface Pro 5 Price Predicting the Surface Pro 5 price is a huge gamble, just as it is with the Surface Pro 5 release date. It’s hard to make a prediction because there’s nothing stable to base that prediction on today. The Surface Pro 4’s cheapest iteration cost $899 at launch, $100 more than its direct predecessor. Microsoft has said that it wants to keep the Surface in the premium hardware category, but there are Surface Pro 4 alternatives that you can purchase that have its specs for a lot less than it costs. Adjusted pricing for the Surface Pro 4. It doesn’t help that Microsoft has fiddled with Surface Pro 4 pricing often. The cheapest Surface Pro 4 now costs $799.99, $100 less than it did at launch. The company removed the Surface Pen from this model. Instead, it’s giving buyers a free Surface Dock worth $99. Microsoft could decide to leave well enough alone and stick with the $899 price tag. This would leave room open for cheaper alternatives from Lenovo, HP and Samsung. Whatever it’s priced at, it almost certainly will not include the Surface Type Cover. The company has sold them separately since the earliest iterations of Surface, despite advertising them together. Surface Pro 5 Features The list of Surface Pro 5 features runs the gamut. There are some features that Microsoft absolutely has to do something about to keep the line viable. Other things seem as if they’d be a good idea. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-size USB port, Mini DisplayPort, headphone jack and Surface Connect port for charging and docking. At least three of these could be combined into one USB 3.0 Type-C port. USB Type-C is already making huge inroads with smartphones. As it stands today, the Surface Connect port is only useful for charging and the $99 dock. A USB 3.0 Type-C port could handle those duties well. Read: iPad Pro vs Surface Pro 4: Which is Better? Another thing Microsoft has to address is battery life. With real-world use, the Surface Pro 4 gets around 6-5 hours of time between charges. This is at a time when the productivity-minded people who buy the device could use more battery life than ever. Surface Pro 5 needs to get well above the 9 hours of video playback the current model reaches. What’s more, it’d be nice if it didn’t take so long to charge. The ports of the Surface Pro 4. Support for mobile internet access support seems possible. The last Surface to support data through a carrier was the then mainstream Surface 3. The Windows team has moved to bolster support for those types of data connections in recent updates and the Surface Team usually builds its hardware around what it thinks will highlight the Windows Team’s work. Surface Pro 5 Specs As for potential Surface Pro 5 specs, we know with some certainty that Surface Pro 5 will have newer processors. The Skylake processors inside the Surface Pro 4 debuted in 2015, meaning it’s about time for a refresh to keep the line on the cutting-edge. Microsoft watcher Paul Thurrott has shared accurate information about the company’s plans before. His sources are saying that Surface Pro 5 will use Intel Kaby Lake processors and that it won’t have a USB Type-C port. Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told. Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic. — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 We don’t know if there’ll be storage and RAM upgrades. A Surface Pro 4 can have as little as 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and an Intel Core M3 fan that doesn’t require a fan. The most powerful Surface Pro 4 has 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an Intel Core i7 processor. Microsoft could aim for a bigger sharper display than the 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 display that’s in the Surface Pro 4 today, but that seems unlikely. People seem to like the tablet’s size already. A sharper display might have negative effects on battery life. Surface Pro 5 Accessories One patent points to some interesting things happening with Surface Pro 5 accessories. It’s an area where Microsoft has only had a few genuine success stories. Most people agree that the Surface Pen, with its rubber eraser cap, metal body and interchangeable tips, is solid. Microsoft’s ultra-thin touch-sensitive cover failed. The battery cover was killed off before the Surface Pro 4 launched. Read: 13 Essential Surface Pro 4 Accessories Remember, only the Surface Pen comes with the Surface Pro 4. Today, you have to replace its AAAA battery once a year. A magnet on the left side of the device hangs on to it. A patent discovered by Patently Mobile would allow the device to charge a Surface Pen and hold it in place. A patent for an upgraded Surface Pen found by Patently Mobile. The Surface Dial arrived last year with the Surface Studio desktop. The Surface Pro 4 supports using the Dial on your desk, but not on your screen the same way the Surface Studio does. It’s hard to imagine the Surface Pro 5 won’t offer this functionality. Surface Studio also sports connecting to an Xbox One Controller without the need for Bluetooth or a separate adapter. It’d be worthwhile for Microsoft to include this technology in the Surface Pro 5 for uniformity’s sake. Plenty of low-end games, like Minecraft Windows 10 Edition would benefit from it. It’ll be interesting to see if the Surface Pen continues to come bundled with the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft frequently discusses the accessory when talking about Surface, that cheaper Surface Pro 4 forces users to buy it separately. The Surface Dial being used with Surface Studio. It’ll also be interesting to see if the Surface Pen continues to come bundled with the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft frequently discusses the accessory when talking about Surface. However, that cheaper Surface Pro 4 that comes without it suggests a new line of thinking. Even if we don’t hear about the Surface Pro 5 at this May 2nd event, expect Microsoft to have something concrete to say about the device this fall. By then, the Surface Pro 4 well be a two-year old device surely ready to be replaced. 5 Best Surface Pro 4 Alternatives in 2017 Huawei MateBook - $399   1 / 5  Boasting nine hours of battery life and a slim profile, the Huawei MateBook is relatively new to the Windows 2-in-1 space. Its maker is known best for affordable Android phones with decent build quality. This machine offers 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core m3 processor for just $399. More expensive configurations add an Intel Core m5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of solid state storage. The Huawei MateBook goes for minimalism at all costs. Its metal frame has just a USB Type-C port, a headset jack and a connection for its add-on keyboard. The front is dominated by a 12-inch high-definition display that has a 2160 x 11440 resolution. Read: Huawei MateBook Review: If iPad and Surface Mated You’ll need to factor in the cost of the digital pen and the keyboard because neither of these come with the Huawei MateBook. They, like the tablet itself, are cheaper than what Surface offers. The MatePen is just $49 from the Microsoft Store. The keyboard, which has a kickstand for propping the device up and backlit keys, costs $99.

When McAfee formally separated from Intel this month, it brought with it 350 Oregon employees. That’s an increase of about 100 from 2010, when the company sold to Intel for $7.7 billion. Most of the company’s Oregon employees work in corporate product development, according to Jaime Le, McAfee’s head of public relations. Last year Intel announced plans to make McAfee its own company again. The chipmaker retains a 49 percent stake following the spinout, which valued McAfee at $4.2 billion. Private equity firm TPG controls the rest.

This sponsored article will focus on a brand new technology, the new 5Gbit Ethernet standard, and two motherboards that carry it; the Z270 SuperCarrier and Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming i7.   Both of these ASRock motherboards carry one of the latest NBase-T controllers, the Aquantia AQC108. ASRock is the only vendor I know of that is offering 5Gbit networking to consumers, and they also made sure that these two motherboards offered three M.2 slots and extra storage options. Modern storage protocols and devices using NAND provide very high transfer speeds. While back in the day, 1Gbit made sense with HDDs, nowadays with SSDs the system can take advantage of faster networking, if only locally.     Why 5Gbit? The story began when vendors started to see a need for network speeds faster than 1Gbps, but couldn't justify the cost for 10Gbit infrastructure. Newer generation Wireless-AC cards were starting to exceed 1Gbps in throughput and 10Gbps over Ethernet requires Cat6a cabling, while most small offices and homes are wired with Cat5e. The NBase-T alliance was formed in 2014 and includes multiple OEMs such as Cisco and HPE and chip companies such as Intel and Aquantia. In fact, in 2015, IEEE decided to use the NBase-T specification to produce the 802.3bz standard that would make 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps speeds over 100m Cat5e and Cat6 possible.     In September 2016, 802.3bz was standardized and approved. Come early 2017, and ASRock is the first consumer motherboard vendor to integrate 2.5Gbps/5Gbps NICs into their Z270 and even X370 motherboards. The benefit of the new Aquantia 2.5/5Gbit NICs is that they will work with older Cat5e cabling, and will work with many of the NBase-T routers, switches, and access points shipped in 2015.     The Modern Bottleneck       A byte is equal to 8 bits, and it's important to differentiate Megabytes per second (MB/s) and Megabits per second (Mbps or Mbits). You should be able to divide numbers in Mbps by eight and then see how many MB/s you would get, however, we also have overhead, so in reality, we never get a clean cut bits/8 to get throughput in bytes.   For instance, the DMI in modern Intel chipsets operates at 32Gbps (x4 PCI-E 3.0), which would give us 4GB/s throughput, but because of the 128b/130b encoding we lose 2% in theory, and in reality after all overhead, we are limited to roughly 3.5GB/s. When we test three fast NVMe drives in RAID 0, we are stuck with this maximum 3.5GB/s limited by the DMI.   SATA (realistically around 550 MB/s limit) and LAN protocols work in the same way, so we don't get 625 MB/s, but closer to 500 MB/s in real-world testing of the 5Gbit protocol. Keep this in mind with the chart and connection protocols, since overhead can be found in all connections. The one outcome that should be simple to see is that there is a need for a long distance local transfer protocol that is faster than the 1Gbit NIC, can reach the same distances, and doesn't cost as much as 10Gbit infrastructure.   For some, the 5Gbit NICs on ASRock motherboards teamed with other 5Gbit systems and NBase-T switches could be the perfect options, especially if the building is already wired with Cat5e.

Pretax profit jumped 27 percent to 3.01 billion euros (R43 billion) in the first quarter, more than expected even taking into account one-off gains that included 183million from revaluing Here after Intel invested in it. Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler last week posted an 87 percent jump in quarterly operating profit, while Volkswagen on Tuesday reported a 28 percent rise, helped by a return to earnings growth at its core VW brand. Share this story Workers clean a BMW 740Le. Pre-tax profit jumped e3.01 billion. Photo: Reuters “The European market, China and some emerging markets are developing much better than expected. Only the US market is tougher,” said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, explaining the strong results from German car makers. He rates BMW shares “in line”. German car association VDA expects global car sales to rise 2 percent this year, driven by China, where sales are seen rising by 6percent, while demand in the US and Western Europe is seen stable. Impressed But European car sales leapt 10.9 percent last month, led by buoyant demand in the region’s top five markets and extra-selling days due to a late Easter this year that saw the holiday fall into this month. Analysts were impressed by the extent to which BMW beat expectations, noting increased profits from Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive. “While this beat might seem moderate compared to the one seen at VW, it is actually slightly better than the one at Mercedes-Benz car division, despite a less favourable product cycle,” wrote Barclays analyst Kristina Church, who rates BMW “overweight/neutral”. BMW shares were little changed at 1.50pm. Read also: BMW to invest R400m in parts hub, offices The revaluation of BMW’s stake in Here came as little surprise after Daimler - a co-owner together with Volkswagen - increased the valuation of its stake. Other valuation effects lifted BMW’s financial result by a further 122 million euros. Intel said in January it was buying a 15 percent stake in Here for an undisclosed sum, after Navinfo, Tencent and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in December. BMW affirmed its guidance for a slight rise in full-year group pretax profit and an operating margin of 8 to 10 percent at its automotive business, which posted a first-quarter margin of 9 percent, down from 9.4 percent a year earlier. Sales rose 12 percent in the quarter to 23.5 billion euros, above the average analyst forecast of 22.1 billion euros, Thomson Reuters estimates show. BMW is set to publish detailed first-quarter results on May 4.

Its annual developer conference here showed a rich mix of creative and sometimes crude work toward its many ambitious aims. Under the hood, Facebook and its cloud computing rivals are essentially global giant data farms where harvesting the good stuff depends on machine learning. Facebook’s engine is unique in part for how it aims to leverage both its global warehouses of servers, and its users’ smartphones. Facebook’s new Caffe 2 framework takes a page -- and a key developer -- from rival Google’s Tensorflow. Caffe 2 is a significantly upgraded version of the machine-learning framework originally created at UC Berkeley by Yangqing Jia. After graduating, he spent two years at Google working on Tensorflow and other projects before Facebook hired him in February 2016 as engineering lead for its AI platform. “We needed more flexibility, so we made [Caffe] more modular and friendly to different hardware back ends…mobile is a major interest,” said Jia in an interview with EE Times on the F8 show floor. Smartphones will use Caffe 2 models to recognize and enhance objects in photos, creating AR effects similar to Pokemon Go and Snapchat filters. The so-called “style transfers” mark Facebook’s first strategic steps to draw consumers into AR. On the show floor, Qualcomm showed neural-network software handling image recognition at 50 frames/second on the Adreno GPU cores in its high-end Snapdragon SoCs. That’s much faster than the 12 f/s the SoC’s Kryo CPU delivers as a default. This summer Qualcomm will release the software in a version that also uses its Hexagon DSP as an accelerator. Facebook is clearly betting on such capabilities being widely available in the future. For today it will have to deal with a widely fragmented handset market that lacks such support. Processor vendors will want to support all broadly used machine learning frameworks, but their efforts will take time. For example, ARM and Ceva, whose cores are widely used in smartphones, have so far expressed support for Tensorflow, not Caffe 2. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm were quick to say they will support Caffe 2. Facebook already uses Nvidia’s GPUs on it training servers. Jia suggested the door open is for Caffe 2 inference accelerators on its servers, similar to the TPUs Google started deploying in 2015. “We see [potential for] a lot of hardware optimizations…There are quite a few computation patterns stabilized enough for hardware to use, and more and more computation patents will stabilize,” he said. However, all the frameworks are still evolving to support a wider range of neural networks with higher performance. “It’s a healthy competition, in general we’re all searching for a better solution for A.I.—it’s like the evolution of programming languages,” he said. For its part, Facebook is replacing a mix of frameworks including Torch with Caffe 2. Facebook made the framework open source and will use it on all its machine learning jobs including computer vision and machine translation on servers. It also is working with rivals Amazon and Microsoft to make it easier for business users to tap into their AI services. “It’s about setting up development environments easily, similar to using pre-installed software,” Jia said. For its part, Google’s Tensorflow is being used by AirBnB, Dropbox, SAP, Twitter, Uber and Xiaomi. Overall, Facebook is behind its Web rivals in machine learning, according to Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research. “AI remains essential to Facebook’s long-term growth as it is sitting upon a mountain of data but still is not in a position to really make the most of the insights and automation that it can provide,” Windsor wrote in a research note that cited progress in image recognition where the company has made significant hires. Qualcomm showed gains running Caffe 2 on its Adreno GPU. (Image EE Times) “Facebook had to move beyond Torch, which they use internally for research, since Torch is based on the Lua language,” said Karl Freund, a senior analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Most AI programmers use and prefer Python, which is native for many other frameworks, including Caffe,” he said. “The largest cloud and Internet sites have developed and promoted their own AI frameworks to keep a competitive edge and develop a loyal ecosystem,” Freund said. “They cannot use someone else’s open source versions as these always lag the code used internally by as much as a year. Each company will have their specific area of focus, for example, Facebook focuses on imaging and Amazon focuses on natural language processing,” he added. Indeed, Facebook AI specialist Joaquin Candela showed how its Mask R-CNN algorithms can now tightly detect and classify people and objects—even when they are moving in video or have parts blocked by other objects. Candela claimed the enhancements in Caffe 2 provided 100x speedups in inference jobs run on smartphones. Its use in Facebook’s image and texting apps — Instagram and Messenger — “makes it the largest A.I. deployment ever,” he said in a keynote.

View All Posts Something is causing great consternation among Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors, who are down nearly 6% on their investments so far in 2017. That’s after NVDA stock hit a high of more than $119 as recently as February. Source: Shutterstock In the original vision for cloud computing, a decade ago, it was an article of faith that the cloud was designed to harness cheap, low-power chips and combine their resources to get the most bang for a computing buck. The advent of artificial intelligence, and the need for clouds to support AI, is forcing a re-think. This is highlighted by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) — the artist formerly known as Google, the first company to bring the cloud to glory — designing its own machine learning chip, dubbed a Tensor Processing Unit. It is said to deliver a lot more price-performance than “competing” processors from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and, to our point, Nvidia. But those who are bearish on NVDA stock are missing an important point. Everybody Wins First, the new Google chip was compared against an old Nvidia chip, not its newest design. More importantly, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wrote in a recent blog post, this is a war where every advanced chip company is going to win. “Without accelerated computing,” he wrote, “the scale-out of AI is simply not practical.” Artificial intelligence, or deep learning, “is a new computing model that has required the invention of a new computing architecture.” The design models that Nvidia has been using for graphics are ideal for deep learning, and thus for delivering AI at scale. This was the point when Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) announced more than a year ago it would ally with NVDA on cloud AI for its “AliCloud.” Google may order production of a bunch of Tensor chips for its cloud processing centers, but do you think Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are going to be filing big orders for a direct cloud competitor’s processors? Not when there are alternatives around, and there are. As Mr. Huang noted, Nvidia has one. A Needless Kerfuffle Nvidia did $6.9 billion worth of business for the quarter ending in January, mainly for graphics processors used in game machines, and its last two quarters indicate fiscal 2018 sales will run well over $8 billion. The April quarter is notoriously weak because most new models come out in the fall for delivery at Christmas. Last year, NVDA had sales of $1.3 billion in the April quarter, from which $470 million, or 73 cents per share, flowed to net income.

Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya led a $10 million investment in the start-up. The Project is in secretive stealth mode. Ari Levy | @levynews 5 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Page Google has slowly been pulling back the curtain on homegrown silicon that could define the future of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some key creators of that project -- the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU -- recently left to team up with Chamath Palihapitiya, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent and outspoken young venture investors, on a stealth start-up. Groq Inc. is the name of the company, at least for the time being. There's no website and no promotional materials. All that exists online are a couple SEC filings from October and December showing that the company raised $10.3 million, and an incorporation filing in the state of Delaware on September 12. "We're really excited about Groq," Palihapitiya wrote in an e-mail. "It's too early to talk specifics, but we think what they're building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing." Groq names three principals in the SEC documents: Jonathan Ross, who helped invent the TPU, Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X "moonshot factory" and Palihapitiya, the founder of investment firm Social Capital. The listed address is Social Capital's headquarters. Palihapitiya told CNBC last month that he invested in a team of ex-Googlers who helped build the chip, which he first heard about on an earnings call two-and-a-half years ago. "They randomly mentioned that they built their own chip for AI and I thought, what is going on here, why is Google competing with Intel?" Palihapitiya said in an interview on "Squawk Box." show chapters Chamath Palihapitiya: I spent 1½ years trying to find the people who made Google's AI chip    Thursday, 16 Mar 2017 | 10:39 AM ET | 00:38 The company (which we now know is Groq) now has eight of the first 10 people from the TPU team "building a next-generation chip," he said. All start-ups are hard, but a new chip company is something most venture capitalists won't touch. The research and development costs required to get a working prototype can be exorbitant. Then there's manufacturing and the Herculean challenge of finding device makers to take a chance on unproven technology. Also, the incumbents -- Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia -- are massive, and Google, Apple and Amazon are developing their own silicon. As crazy as it may be, Palihapitiya is taking the plunge. This next wave of chip innovation "can empower companies like Facebook and Amazon, Tesla, the government to do things with machine learning and computers that nobody could do before," he said in last month's interview. Ross's LinkedIn page says he left Google in September and is currently "gainfully unemployed." According to Wightman's profile, he left the same month but doesn't say where he went. Wightman confirmed the funding in an e-mail and said, "we're still heads down right now." Launching the TPU Google made its first public pronouncement about the TPU in May with a blog post just ahead of the company's annual developers conference. Norm Jouppi, one of the project heads, said Google had been using the technology internally for over a year for things like improving the relevance of search results and the accuracy of its maps. It's also part of Google's Cloud Platform in a product called TensorFlow that lets other companies run machine learning workloads in Google's data centers. The essence of TPUs is the ability to squeeze heavy and highly sophisticated computation into less silicon. Machine learning, or the training of computers to get smarter as datasets increase and without the need of human interference, is weaving its way into all types of consumer and business apps. At Google's scale, that work is too taxing for today's processors. Palihapitiya said at a conference in January that the main reason he's bullish on Google as an investment is because "they're an order of magnitude ahead" of everyone else. He's not the only investor paying attention. Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Janus, said that Google is doing everything it can to ensure maximum performance and efficiency to handle the heft of machine learning workloads. Source: Google Google’s tensor processing unit or TPU. "They've said, if we're going to do this and win, we need the most efficient way using the least amount of power," he said. "They feel like they've cracked the code." Earlier this month, Google provided its first real update on TPUs in a 17-page report titled, "In-Datacenter performance analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit." In a summary blog post, Jouppi wrote that AI workloads using TPUs are running 15 to 30 times faster than contemporary processors, while efficiency is 30 to 80 times better. The study compared TPUs to chips from Intel and Nvidia. Ross was one of 75 authors of the report. He's also listed in the paper as an inventor on four patents, all tied to neural networks processors and computation, which you can think of as computing systems designed to mimic the brain. Ross's LinkedIn page says he started the TPU with one other engineer as part of a 20 percent project, the perk that lets Google employees spend one-fifth of their time working on a side project they think will benefit the company. From 2013 to 2015, he worked as a Google hardware engineer in Madison, Wisconsin, home to one of the principal hotbeds of TPU development. Wightman co-founded four companies prior to his Google days. At Google X he worked on futuristic projects like Loon, a network of balloons that's setting out to provide a more extensive internet.

Pai said on Thursday that his visits with executives at Facebook, Cisco, Oracle, and Intel were constructive and that he believed the companies wanted to find “common ground.” Advertisement Web companies have supported net neutrality, saying the protections guard them from paying tolls to get their content in front of consumers. Pai said that he agreed with the broad principles of net neutrality but that the rules, created in 2015, went too far in restricting broadband providers. “I think they were appreciative,” Pai said of the tech companies. “I have been soliciting thoughts on online protections.” Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About April 20, 2017 New Part Day: Very Cheap LIDAR 29 Comments by: Brian Benchoff April 20, 2017 Self-driving cars are, apparently, the next big thing. This thought is predicated on advancements in machine vision and cheaper, better sensors. For the machine vision part of the equation, Nvidia, Intel, and Google are putting out some interesting bits of hardware. The sensors, though? We’re going to need LIDAR, better distance sensors, more capable CAN bus dongles, and the equipment to tie it all together. This is the cheapest LIDAR we’ve ever seen. The RPLIDAR is a new product from Seeed Studios, and it’s an affordable LIDAR for everyone. $400 USD gets you one module, and bizarrely $358 USD gets you two modules. Don’t ask questions — this price point was unheard of a mere five years ago. Basically, this LIDAR unit is a spinning module connected to a motor via a belt. A laser range finder is hidden in the spinny bits and connected to a UART and USB interface through a slip ring. Mount this LIDAR unit on a robot, apply power, and the spinny bit does its thing at about 400-500 RPM. The tata that comes out includes distance (in millimeters), bearing (in units of degrees), quality of the measurement, and a start flag once every time the head makes a revolution. If you’ve never converted polar to cartesian coordinates, this is a great place to start. Although self-driving cars and selfie drones are the future, this part is probably unsuitable for any project with sufficient mass or velocity. The scanning range of this LIDAR is only about 6 meters and insufficient for retrofitting a Toyota Camry with artificial intelligence. That said, this is a cheap LIDAR that opens the door to a lot of experimentation ranging from small robots to recreating that one Radiohead video.

EDT April 20, 2017 Police officers block the access to the Champs Elysees near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris after a shooting on April 20, 2017. One police officer was killed and another wounded today in a shooting on Paris's Champs Elysees, police said just days ahead of France's presidential election. France's interior ministry said the attacker was killed in the incident on the world famous boulevard that is popular with tourists. / AFP PHOTO / THOMAS SAMSON (Photo credit should read THOMAS SAMSON/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: THOMAS SAMSON) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PARIS, FRANCE (USAT) - The Islamic State claimed responsibility after one police officer was killed in a rare exchange of gunfire on the famed Champs-Elysees in central Paris just days before a critical presidential election. Two other officers were seriously wounded in the attack in the popular tourist area in central Paris. The gunman was killed by police. The Islamic State identified the attacker as Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki through its Amaq news agency, according to SITE Intel Group, a U.S.-based organization that monitors terrorists' activity online. French President Francois Hollande said he is convinced the circumstances of the Paris shooting points to terrorist act, the Associated Press reported. Paris police spokeswoman Johanna Primevert told AP the gunman deliberately targeted police on guard near the Franklin Roosevelt subway station. She said he appeared to act alone. Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told BFM television that a man stepped from a car and opened fire on a police vehicle. A witness told Reuters that the attacker opened fire with a machine gun. Security has been high in France leading up to the first round of hotly contested presidential elections Sunday. A French station hosting a televised event with the 11 candidates briefly interrupted its broadcast to report the shootings, AP reported. As police blocked off key roadways in the heart of the French capital and told people to avoid the area, the broad avenues leading to the Arc de Triomphe were awash in police vehicles decked with whirling blue lights. French prosecutors opened a terrorism investigation into the attack. Two police officers told AP the attacker had been flagged as an extremist, but offered no further details. The officers spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity to share information about the ongoing investigation. In Washington, President Trump said the shooting in Paris “looks like another terrorist attack." "It just never ends, We have to to be strong and we have to be vigilant, and I've been saying it for a long time," he added. France has lived under a state of emergency declared following a terrorist attack in November 2015 that left 130 dead.   © 2017 USATODAY.COM CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Mark Whitaker turns himself in 4-year-old boy's father arrested for his death 3-year-old loses his life after being shot BREAKING: Elizabeth Thomas found safe, ex-teacher arrested Teenage fist fight video on Facebook causes controversy Viewer video records shots fired in downtown Seattle Is a basketball court to blame for rise in problems?

Germain • LinuxInsider • ECT News Network Apr 20, 2017 3:36 PM PT Docker this week introduced two new projects at DockerCon with an eye to helping operating system vendors, software creators and in-house tinkerers create container-native OSes and container-based systems. The projects are based on a new model for cross-ecosystem collaboration and the advancement of containerized software. Both projects aim to help users adopt container technology for all major technology platforms used in data centers and the cloud, as well as in the Internet of Things. The Moby Project provides a library of components, plus a framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems. It also provides a community center for container enthusiasts to experiment and exchange ideas. LinuxKit bundles the tools to build custom Linux subsystems with just the components the runtime platform requires for Linux container functionality. It provides the Linux elements otherwise missing as a component for a container platform on non-Linux systems such as Mac and Windows computers. The projects have a shared goal of advancing the software containerization movement and helping take containers mainstream. The two projects mark the start of Docker's next phase of container innovation, said David Messina, senior vice president of marketing at Docker. The new projects provide a way to create, share, use and build container systems that was not possible with any open source project in the past, he said. Moby's open source structure enables Docker to collaborate on architecture, design and experimentation with bleeding-edge features, Messina told LinuxInsider. Docker developed LinuxKit in collaboration with Silicon partner ARMl, infrastructure providers like HPE, and cloud companies including Microsoft and IBM. Docker released LinuxKit as an open source project to be managed by The Linux Foundation under its open-governance practices. The Moby Project and LinuxKit make customer use of Docker technology easier and more effective. The new phase of evolution is mainstream deployment, tied to the increasing specialization of use cases across all industries, said Messina. "Both these projects are about leveraging interchangeable containerized components to create new systems," he explained. Driving Factors The driving interest in Docker is getting one uniform packaging format, API and tooling from dev to ops. Its promise is the ability to develop software across any language, said Messina. It also creates applications that are portable across any infrastructure in a much more agile fashion. The new collaboration initiatives could lead to faster, simpler deployments, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "Both efforts are similarly aimed at simplifying critical parts of deploying and supporting container environments," he told LinuxInsider. "Docker's decision to open source the technology and enlist notable partners -- including HPE, Intel, ARM, IBM and Microsoft -- in the effort suggest that it is on the right path." How Moby Works Moby allows anything that can be containerized to become a Moby component, which will generate continuing opportunities for collaboration with other projects outside of Docker. Contributors can leverage well-tested common components to build highly specialized container systems more rapidly. With many deployments in place, contributors can differentiate on features. The Moby library provides participants with more than 80 components derived from Docker. Participants also can bring their own components packaged as containers with the option to mix and match among all of the components to create a customized container system. The new development phase grew out of a program Docker began building last year to develop a toolkit to assemble custom Linux subsystems. The intention was to create a more native experience for its desktop (Windows, Mac) and cloud platforms. That became the LinuxKit that provides the community with a solution to create a custom OS. "Moby gives the same tool that Docker uses internally to build, test and package Docker software to the community, so it will accelerate innovation and help produce specialized architectures for running containers," noted Giorgio Regni, CTO at Scality. "It also means we can use the same tools to build private VM images, bare metal images and public cloud images in a unified way," he told LinuxInsider. That is all part of what is driving interest in the use of container technology. Developers want choice and freedom, Regni said. Containers help them achieve freedom of coding language, freedom of Linux-based distribution, freedom of runtime -- public cloud, local virtual machines, servers or even laptops. Building From Kit LinuxKit allows users to create secure Linux subsystems. That security is anchored around the inherent secure container design. The kit makes it easy for users to assemble the Linux subsystem with only needed services. All the components run in containers. LinuxKit produces a minimalist boot environment to run containers, which provides a security advantage, as it creates a smaller attack surface than general purpose systems. It also provides a read-only root file-system for an immutable infrastructure approach to deployments enabled by InfraKit. The LinuxKit has a community-first security process. It will serve as an incubator for security-related innovations. LinuxKit's container-native nature gives it a very minimal size of only 35 MB and a minimal boot time. Since all system services are containers, everything can be removed or replaced. This container-native approach means that it is highly portable and can work in many environments: desktop, server, IOT, mainframe, bare metal and virtualized systems. Easier Adoption Driver Containerization can offer a simpler, faster and more elegant way than traditional virtualization platforms to deploy and support business workloads. Customers easily can build LinuxKit images optimized for the hardware platforms and operating systems they employ, said Pund-IT's King. Those are crucial points for technically savvy organizations that depend on distributed applications. "That said, there is not really an either/or choice between containers and virtualization," observed King. "Both can be powerful solutions for a range of processes. Both are intelligent extensions of container technology that also support Docker's business strategy." Although it is hard to predict the viability of LinuxKit and the Moby Project at this point, King added, you can not fault Docker's ambition. Jack M.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Worldwide Market for Internet of Things Is Expected to Reach $185.9 Billion by 2023; Finds New Report Lewes, DE — (SBWIRE) — 04/20/2017 — Worldwide Internet of Things (IoT) markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of sensors, cameras, and platforms that are used to help implement precision digital control and send alerts for all manner or management of devices and machinery. Visualization and digitization let people better control any device or mechanical thing. Providers of Industrial IoT aim to implement asset efficiency solutions. Designing the asset efficiency solution, developing the application, adapting advanced engineering knowledge for the use cases, and supplying the information platform is the composite task of the analytics engine. IBM is a premier supplier of an analytics engine with its Watson product. There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. Bosch supplies industrial IoT sensor technology, acquiring data from the edge, providing device management. Scalability is achieved by the Bosch IoT Suite and ProSyst IoT middleware. The Vorto code generator enables M2M modelling. PTC supplies the Thingworx Application Enablement Platform (AEP), used for creating dashboards, widgets and other user interface elements. Intel provides the Moon Island Gateway used for data aggregation at the edge, as well as horizontal infrastructure in collaboration with HP. Hitachi analytics is used to diagnose manufacturing process. Hitachi uses its analytics platform to integrate production and sensor data outputs to help visualize, analyze and diagnose a manufacture polymer mixing problems. A polymer mixing process was said to be producing inconsistent output quality, with yields dipping to 50%. Hitachi addressed the scrapping of poor batches and huge costs by addressing ever-changing product specifications and variations in a range of production parameters. Using IoT and the analytics platform, production engineers were able to stabilize the process even as new product formulations were introduced. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Users, partners, suppliers and other mega-datacenters communicate using digital systems that are automated and self-healing. The effect on the business is compelling, managers have much more responsibility to create maps of strategy and work with IT to see that developers tune the software to fit the current competitive environment. The explosion of data comes from smart phone apps and IoT digital onslaught of streaming data that needs to be processed in real time to look for anomalies, look for change, set alerts, and provide automated response to shifts. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the study, „Transparency is one of the benefits of IoT that sensors bring to digital controls. The benefits of digital manufacturing, farming, and automotive vehicles are higher productivity and more efficient use of resource. Transparency in is being asked for by consumers. Consumers want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used in food preparation, and when and how the food was harvested and transported. They want to know about consistent refrigeration during transport.” Use of IoT sensors and cameras represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry. Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying and driving, making ease of use, flight stability, and automated cars a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward. By furthering innovation, IoT continued growth is assured. The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is $16.3 billion in 2016 anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ForgeRock Edge Security Offers Complete End-to-End Security for Internet of Things Deployments /EINPresswire.com/ — SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwired – Apr 20, 2017) – ForgeRock®, the leading platform provider of digital identity management solutions, today announced ForgeRock Edge Security, offering complete end-to-end security for internet of things (IoT) deployments. These new edge security capabilities will be demonstrated at Hannover Messe on April 24. Through an innovative combination of cryptographic security and standards-based identity technologies, ForgeRock Edge Security bridges the gap between device/chip and cloud/web security paradigms with new software that runs on smart edge devices, providing a trusted device identity proofing and registration process. Recent cybercrime and hacking exploits have shown clearly that much of the IoT — devices, services and applications — is coming online largely in the absence of adequate security measures due to the weakness of legacy password- and certificate-oriented authentication. ForgeRock Edge Security provides a far superior solution that dramatically increases security by applying identity principles to establish and maintain trust of IoT devices and their communications. To empower partners and end users to leverage ForgeRock Edge Security, ForgeRock announced its Early Access Program. In mission critical environments, ForgeRock Edge Security can also leverage today’s leading edge chip security providers, including ARM TrustZone technology, Intel Software Guard Extensions, and Trustonic’s chip embedded Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  „Business processes are only as secure as their weakest link. Inadequate password, certificate-based authentication and encryption processes mean that many devices in IoT deployments today are weak links,” said Michael Horne, vice president and deputy general manager, IoT Business, ARM. „ForgeRock’s new Edge Security offering will enable IoT developers to fully realize the advantages of the ARM mbed™ IoT Device Platform and ARM TrustZone technology.” ForgeRock Edge Security includes a ForgeRock Trusted Application (TA) that runs in the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a secure area of the main processor. This allows ForgeRock to establish the all-important hardware root-of-trust on devices, and store cryptographic secrets in the most secure element of the device hardware — all without using any username/passwords or non-scalable PKI certificates. „We are very excited that the ForgeRock Edge Security solution leverages the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment, which is now available in more than 1 billion smart devices, taking full advantage of the latest security chip technologies such as ARM TrustZone,” says George Kanuck, SVP Global Sales and Marketing at Trustonic. To provide business value, IoT devices must seamlessly integrate with the connected world, including clouds, microservices, applications, and their protected APIs, and, of course, people. ForgeRock Edge Security includes a secure IoT message broker to provide client authorization for trusted devices and services, and rich data security using cryptographic secrets to sign and encrypt data for privacy and integrity. As the newest component within the Identity Platform, ForgeRock Edge Security allows organizations to securely and centrally manage digital identities, authentication and authorization for everyone and everything. As ForgeRock Founder and CTO Lasse Andresen describes it: „With the launch of ForgeRock Edge Security, we’ve extended our leadership in providing secure digital identity from chip-to-cloud, and will enable organizations of any size to provide end-to-end security at enormous scale.” In addition to Dell being an early tester of ForgeRock Edge Security, ForgeRock has also joined the Dell IoT Solutions Partner Program. Jason Shepherd, Director of IoT Strategy and Partnerships at Dell said: „Our customers are deploying Dell Edge Gateways in the world’s most rugged and industrial environments, so we understand that security and safety should never be an afterthought. We like that ForgeRock takes a purpose-built approach to IoT security, enabling end-to-end trust, so our customers can deploy IoT initiatives with functional integrity and device security assured. We’re excited to have ForgeRock on-board as a Dell IoT Solutions Partner and look forward to helping our customers see real ROI from their IoT deployments.” About ForgeRock ForgeRock® is the Digital Identity Management company transforming the way organizations interact securely with customers, employees, devices, and things. Organizations adopt the ForgeRock Identity Platform™ as their digital identity system of record to monetize customer relationships, address stringent regulations for privacy and consent (GDPR, HIPAA, FCC privacy, etc.), and leverage the internet of things. ForgeRock serves hundreds of brands, including Morningstar, Vodafone, GEICO, Toyota, TomTom, and Pearson, as well as governments like Norway, Canada, and Belgium, securing billions of identities worldwide. ForgeRock has offices across Europe, the USA, and Asia.

Both of them boast a relatively thin and light design, making them slightly more portable than your average gaming notebook. The GP62MVR X Leopard Pro is a 15.6” gaming notebook with a 1920 x 1080 IPS display with wide-viewing angles. MSI GP72VR X Leopard Pro on the other hand, is a bigger 17.3” gaming notebook with a Full HD 120 Hz IPS panel offering a low 5ms response time for a smooth, jitter-free gaming experience. In terms of the hardware specifications, both notebooks are more or less identical. The two notebooks run on a 7th Gen Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, with 16GB (upgradeable to 32GB) of DDR4 memory. Like most recent gaming notebooks, the new Leopard Pro models support the latest NVMe SSDs which offer read speeds of up to 2,200 MB/s. For storing all your multimedia and other personal data, they do include an additional 2.5” SATA HDD as well. To give you a competitive edge over rivals, the notebooks feature a Steel Series keyboard with RGB backlighting and GameSense support. They also include Killer Gb LAN (E2400) for low-latency gaming, 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.2 (Intel 3168). I/O connectors include 1 USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, 2 Type-A USB 3.0, 1 USB 2.0, 1 RJ45, 1 SD card reader, 1 HDMI output, and a 1 Mini-DisplayPort. Keeping the lights on is a 6-cell 41Whr battery. The new MSI Leopard Pro series gaming laptops will go on sale later this month with a starting price of $1,099 (SGD 1,536). For the 17.3-inch model, the price can go up to over $1,500 (SGD 2,096) when fully tricked-out.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Unofficial Patch Unblocks Windows 7 and 8.1 Updates for Kaby Lake, Ryzen Unofficial Patch Unblocks Windows 7 and 8.1 Updates for Kaby Lake, Ryzen By Ryan Whitwam on April 20, 2017 at 2:15 pm Comment It should be hard for Microsoft to make any more mistakes with its Windows 10 push, but it keeps finding new ways. After nagging everyone incessantly about upgrading, updating computers without asking, and making Windows 10 patches mandatory, Microsoft has started disallowing Windows 7 and 8.1 updates on machines running the latest hardware. One developer has had enough, and is releasing a patch to help users get around this artificial blockade. The unofficial patch from a developer calling him or herself ‘Zeffy’ on GitHub targets those running very new CPUs on older versions of Windows. Windows 7 and 8 are still supported with updates, but Microsoft has started blocking non-security updates for systems that run Intel 7th-Generation Kaby Lake processors, AMD “Bristol Ridge” Rizen chips, or the Qualcomm 8996 (Snapdragon 820 and 821) SoC. If you try to install the new April patches for Windows 7 or 8.1 on these systems, it will fail with error code 8024003. The only solution Microsoft offers for that error is to upgrade to Windows 10. To be clear, there does not seem to be any legitimate reason to block these updates. Microsoft just really, really wants you to use Windows 10. The Zeffy patch goes after a change Microsoft introduced in March that identifies the system’s CPU. As the changelog explained at the time, the patch “Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update.” Zeffy is very clear on his dislike for Windows 10 when he calls this “essentially a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10.” Should you install Zeffy’s fix, two functions found in wuaueng.dll update code will be disabled. It is these functions, IsCPUSupported(void) and IsDeviceServiceable(void), that are responsible for blocking the update. This patch reportedly does the job, allowing you to install the previously blocked non-security updates on Windows 7 and 8.1 on affected systems. However, the Zeffy patch will need to be reapplied every time wuaueng.dll is updated by Microsoft. It’s also possible a future update will try to prevent this workaround. Then, maybe someone will release another custom patch, Microsoft will block that one, and then the whole thing starts all over. The patch download is less than a megabyte and installs in a single step. The source code is available, so it’s unlikely Zeffy is up to anything shady. That said, using a third-party tool to modify Windows system files is not without risk.

(AP) Federal Communications Chairman Ajit Pai said Thursday he met with Silicon Valley leaders this week to discuss ways to protect consumers, even as he's working to eliminate the controversial Obama-era "net neutrality" regulation that provided some level of protection. Obama's net neutrality regulation was aimed at making sure people can't have certain content from companies prioritized just because people choose to use competitor companies for their Internet service. But that rule was also opposed by many Republicans and the telecommunications industry, since it subjected Internet service providers to the regulations that govern utilities. The net neutrality rules were approved by the FCC in 2015. Pai is poised to reverse the regulations, and the agency under his chairmanship has already voted to weaken them. But Pai declined to say whether his Monday talks with the companies, which included Facebook, Cisco, Oracle, Intel and others, involved how to unwind net neutrality. He also repeatedly told reporters he would not discuss any current pending proceedings in the works. "Outside of the context of any pending proceeding, I've simply soliciting thoughts on how to secure the online consumer protections that people have talked about," he said. Pai also responded to a report that he met this week with the Internet Association, a trade group representing companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon that want to preserve net neutrality. On those meetings, Pai said "the goal here is pretty simple. I've been consistent in my view that I favor a free and open Internet and that I oppose Title II." Title II is the classification that treats ISPs like utilities, and major telecom players have complained of the undue burden on competition and threats to innovation and infrastructure investment. An FCC spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that the agency had no further comment on the meetings beyond what Pai said. The press conference followed a meeting in which the FCC voted to pass multiple rules. Along party lines, the agency voted to ease regulations on the market for data services and to ease limits on TV station ownership, which could result in more mergers.

Military Military: The Intel VIDEO: Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter More than 1,000 desert tortoises are taking a trip with the Marine Corps this month. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. During the two-week long process, the hubcap-sized tortoises are being loaded into plastic containers, which are then stacked and strapped to a helicopter. More than 1,000 desert tortoises get a Marine Corps airlift. Their new home will be swaths of federal land to the north and southeast of the Twentynine Palms base, Marine officials said. The areas were deemed far enough away that the tortoises wouldn’t migrate back to the original habitat. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The cost of the whole effort, including a 30-year monitoring program to ensure the health of the federally protected species, is $50 million. The Marines at the Twentynine Palms base want to be able to practice large-scale exercises with live fire and combined-arms maneuvering. The campaign goes back to 2008, when the Corps began studying how to do it without breaking environmental law. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act handed land formerly managed by the Bureau of Land Management to the Defense Department. Tortoises living on that land are now being moved. In March 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a notice of intent to sue, arguing that the federal government failed to fully examine how the move might harm the tortoises. However, the move went ahead this month after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the Marine Corps that its review wouldn’t be done before the spring window for the move, Marine Corps officials said. It’s not the first time that the Corps has been in the tortoise-moving business. In 2006, the Twentynine Palms base relocated 17 adult tortoises in order to build a training range. Marine officials say no tortoises died during three years of post-move monitoring. This time, Marine Corps biologists will monitor tortoises intensely for the first five years. Then monitoring requirements will diminish over time until the 30-year obligation is met, officials said. About 235 juveniles too small for relocation are being admitted to the base’s “headstart facility,” where they will remain until they grow large enough to better survive on their own.

Español On Tuesday, the Federal Electoral Commission reported that Citgo Petroleum, the only remaning subsidiary in the United States of the Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), donated half a million dollars for the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Citgo, is currently mortgaged as collateral for a loan from Russia. However, it is among 11 companies that donated more than half a million dollars to the committee that was responsible for organizing the Republican candidate’s inauguration ceremony this past January 20th.

The organizing committee for Donald Trump’s inauguration collected USD $106.7 million, which was double the amount raised for former President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009. “The funds raised for the inaugural celebration allowed President Donald Trump to give the American people the opportunity to experience an incredible moment in our democracy where we witnessed the peaceful transition of power, the cornerstone of American democracy,” said Tom Barrack, chairman of the inaugural committee, in a statement. While this information was made public, the US State Department issued an appeal to “stop violations and demand accountability in Venezuela‘s protests”, where over the past month seven people have already died and hundreds of people have been arrested for protesting against Nicolas Maduro’s dictatorial regime. Trump shows no signs of buddying up with Venezuelan dictator Maduro. He and Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently welcomed Lilian Tintori, wife of political prisoner Leopoldo Lopez, to the White House, and he has taken a hard stance against the South American regime.

On Wednesday, in his first hearing in Guatemalan courts, the former official stated that he will not oppose being extradited to Mexico, but will wait for Mexican authorities to formalize the petition for that procedure. Javier Duarte, who was notified by the Guatemalan prosecutor's office about the accusation against him, said: "I cannot approve my extradition until my defense evaluates the formal request, which has to arrive from Mexico."

This detention, as reported by the PGR, is the result of: "An arrest warrant issued by the District Judge Specialized in the Accusatory Criminal System of the Federal Criminal Justice Center in Mexico City, residing in the northern prison for the crimes of operations with illicit funds and organized crime." Javier Duarte's alleged accomplice was arrested "for purposes of extradition in the city of Cabrils, Barcelona" by agents of the General Directorate of Police of the Ministry of Interior of the Kingdom of Spain.

PurchasingB2B Subscribe News Features Opinions Events More Digital Edition Digital Archives Salary Calculator Subscribe About Us Contact Us Advertise Canadian universities selected for North American self-driving car competition GM and SAE International launched the competition for undergraduate students dubbed the "AutoDrive Challenge" April 20, 2017 Categories Fleet Topics Automotive Tags autonomous vehicles General Motors University of Toronto University of Waterloo April 20, 2017 The Canadian Press Two Canadian universities have been chosen to participate in a North American competition to develop a self-driving car in three years. The University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo will compete against each other and six American schools with the goal of autonomous driving in an urban setting by 2020. General Motors and SAE International, an engineering association, have launched the competition designed for undergraduate students that they’ve dubbed the “AutoDrive Challenge.” Tim Barfoot, an engineering professor with the University of Toronto who is overseeing his school’s team, said student demand is intense just days after last week’s announcement that the university had been accepted as a competitor. “There’s something about turning a robot into a vehicle that really captures people’s imaginations,” Barfoot said, adding 250 students have expressed interest in joining the team. “When you can sit inside the robot and it’s driving around, that’s a totally different experience than watching it from the outside.” The other schools competing are Kettering University, Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, North Carolina A&T University, Texas A&M University and Virginia Tech. Each school will receive a Chevrolet Bolt, General Motors’ new electric car, to work on. Intel will provide the computers needed and third parties will provide sensors. The rest will be up to the students. Next spring the schools will enter the first phase of the competition that will test straight roadway driving and object avoidance. By the third and final phase, which will take place at General Motors’ test facility in Yuma, Ariz., the cars will be navigating a complex urban setting, according to General Motors Canada spokesperson Uzma Mustafa. The upshot for General Motors is simple: they’re looking to create a pipeline of well-trained engineers to hire in the company’s big push towards self-driving cars and related technologies. At an event with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last June, the Detroit-based car company announced it was looking to hire about 700 engineers in the next few years, many of whom will work at a new automotive software development centre in Markham, Ont. “We have cars being tested in the United States and this is a good talent pool to see where the ideas are,” Mustafa said. Derek Rayside, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Waterloo who is overseeing his school’s team, said the competition is unique because it is geared for undergraduate students. Artificial intelligence research is a booming field at his school, he said, with at least 20 professors working on various aspects of it, including many in the automotive area. But much of that research is limited to professors, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. “At the undergraduate level, it’s often difficult for those students, to get into that area of research,” Rayside said. “You can’t just do this on your own—you need all this infrastructure, like the car, the computers, the sensors.” Both schools say their teams will be large. Barfoot thinks his team will have 100 students, but he’s now scrambling to figure out how to accommodate everyone who is interested. Rayside thinks his team will be upwards of 50 students, but admits that could number could grow. “There is huge, huge interest here, in just a few days,” Rayside said, noting his university has already selected a name for the car: WATonomous. The goal is to achieve what’s known as “level four” autonomy by the end of the competition, Rayside said. “That’s a very ambitious goal, but it’s good to have ambitious goals,” he said. Level zero is no automation, Rayside explained. “Level one is stuff like lane-keeping, so you start drifting out of the lane and the car can nudge you back into the lane and that’s on the market now,” he said. “Level two is stuff like the car senses there might be a collision and it applies emergency braking before you can get your foot down. That is on the market now and there is data that shows that this is making the world a safer place.” At level three, the car starts driving on its own, which isn’t available to the public, but exists at research facilities, he said, including at the University of Waterloo, where the self-driving “Autonomoose”—developed by a team of professors, researchers and graduate students—is being tested. “For levels three and four, the car is allowed to ask the human for help, if it’s confused and not sure what to do,” Rayside said. “At level five, the car is not allowed to ask for help. Nobody can do level 5 and nobody is even close to level 5.” News from © Canadian Press Enterprises Inc. 2016 Share This Post Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Print this page Related Posts Honda Civic named North American Car of the Year GM announces plan to expand self driving car research Ford teams up on autonomous driving Chevrolet Volt wins 2011 North American Car of the Year Tesla unveiling electric semi truck in September Hydrogen fuel cell cars gain on electrics Services Advertise Contact Us Subscribe Print Subscribe E-News View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives Manufacturing Network Sitemap Copyright Notice Privacy Policy © Copyright 2017 Annex Business Media × Close REDWIRE Powered by FRASERS REDWIRE is News you can use from Leading Suppliers.

Most notably: How to pull off a successful heist while under pressure from a government agency. Or how to avoid a mattress falling off a truck on the freeway. The latter, according to Bloomberg, is just one of the in-game scenarios being used by researchers and engineers to train autonomous vehicle technology. That’s right: Your self-driving car is taking cues from a system that rewards violent joyrides and police evasion. As Bloomberg pointed out, manufacturers need to start relying more on these types of endless simulators in order to meet their daunting autonomous-tech deadlines. Scientists at Germany’s Darmstadt University and Intel Labs discovered that last year when they partnered to create a new method for sourcing visual data from GTA, which can be fed to computers to teach vehicles how to drive independently. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” Davide Bacchet, head of simulation at startup NIO—which plans to release its first autonomous electric vehicles in the US in 2020—told Bloomberg. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” Boasting more than 260 types of vehicles, 1,000-plus unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 different weather conditions, and a myriad of bridges, traffic signals, tunnels, and intersections—i.e. real-life circumstances—Grand Theft Auto V is the ideal fictional world for self-driving lessons. The game provides “the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” Princeton University professor and advisor to the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team, Alain Kornhauser, said in a statement to Bloomberg. Self-driving car development company Waymo has already realized the benefits of always-on software, which can simulate driving more than 3 million miles in one day. At the Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system,” Bloomberg reported, using the Quick Brown Fox test: running endlessly in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ForgeRock Edge Security Offers Complete End-to-End Security for Internet of Things Deployments Along with expanded solution offering, ForgeRock establishes Early Access Program and introduces initial participants, including ARM, Dell, and Trustonic SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwired – Apr 20, 2017) – ForgeRock®, the leading platform provider of digital identity management solutions, today announced ForgeRock Edge Security, offering complete end-to-end security for internet of things (IoT) deployments. These new edge security capabilities will be demonstrated at Hannover Messe on April 24. Through an innovative combination of cryptographic security and standards-based identity technologies, ForgeRock Edge Security bridges the gap between device/chip and cloud/web security paradigms with new software that runs on smart edge devices, providing a trusted device identity proofing and registration process. Recent cybercrime and hacking exploits have shown clearly that much of the IoT — devices, services and applications — is coming online largely in the absence of adequate security measures due to the weakness of legacy password- and certificate-oriented authentication. ForgeRock Edge Security provides a far superior solution that dramatically increases security by applying identity principles to establish and maintain trust of IoT devices and their communications. To empower partners and end users to leverage ForgeRock Edge Security, ForgeRock announced its Early Access Program. In mission critical environments, ForgeRock Edge Security can also leverage today’s leading edge chip security providers, including ARM TrustZone technology, Intel Software Guard Extensions, and Trustonic’s chip embedded Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  „Business processes are only as secure as their weakest link. Inadequate password, certificate-based authentication and encryption processes mean that many devices in IoT deployments today are weak links,” said Michael Horne, vice president and deputy general manager, IoT Business, ARM. „ForgeRock’s new Edge Security offering will enable IoT developers to fully realize the advantages of the ARM mbed™ IoT Device Platform and ARM TrustZone technology.” ForgeRock Edge Security includes a ForgeRock Trusted Application (TA) that runs in the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a secure area of the main processor. This allows ForgeRock to establish the all-important hardware root-of-trust on devices, and store cryptographic secrets in the most secure element of the device hardware — all without using any username/passwords or non-scalable PKI certificates. „We are very excited that the ForgeRock Edge Security solution leverages the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment, which is now available in more than 1 billion smart devices, taking full advantage of the latest security chip technologies such as ARM TrustZone,” says George Kanuck, SVP Global Sales and Marketing at Trustonic. To provide business value, IoT devices must seamlessly integrate with the connected world, including clouds, microservices, applications, and their protected APIs, and, of course, people. ForgeRock Edge Security includes a secure IoT message broker to provide client authorization for trusted devices and services, and rich data security using cryptographic secrets to sign and encrypt data for privacy and integrity. As the newest component within the Identity Platform, ForgeRock Edge Security allows organizations to securely and centrally manage digital identities, authentication and authorization for everyone and everything. As ForgeRock Founder and CTO Lasse Andresen describes it: „With the launch of ForgeRock Edge Security, we’ve extended our leadership in providing secure digital identity from chip-to-cloud, and will enable organizations of any size to provide end-to-end security at enormous scale.” In addition to Dell being an early tester of ForgeRock Edge Security, ForgeRock has also joined the Dell IoT Solutions Partner Program. Jason Shepherd, Director of IoT Strategy and Partnerships at Dell said: „Our customers are deploying Dell Edge Gateways in the world’s most rugged and industrial environments, so we understand that security and safety should never be an afterthought. We like that ForgeRock takes a purpose-built approach to IoT security, enabling end-to-end trust, so our customers can deploy IoT initiatives with functional integrity and device security assured. We’re excited to have ForgeRock on-board as a Dell IoT Solutions Partner and look forward to helping our customers see real ROI from their IoT deployments.” About ForgeRock ForgeRock® is the Digital Identity Management company transforming the way organizations interact securely with customers, employees, devices, and things. Organizations adopt the ForgeRock Identity Platform™ as their digital identity system of record to monetize customer relationships, address stringent regulations for privacy and consent (GDPR, HIPAA, FCC privacy, etc.), and leverage the internet of things. ForgeRock serves hundreds of brands, including Morningstar, Vodafone, GEICO, Toyota, TomTom, and Pearson, as well as governments like Norway, Canada, and Belgium, securing billions of identities worldwide. ForgeRock has offices across Europe, the USA, and Asia.

User-created patch lets Kaby Lake and Ryzen PCs receive Windows 7 updates But it may be more trouble than it's worth. Ian Paul (PC World (US online)) on 21 April, 2017 00:01 0 - - - - print email Less than a week ago, Microsoft beganÂ actively blocking users from receiving updates on PCs running Windows 7 or 8 with a modern Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen processor. Surprise! An open-source patch is already available that lets affected users start snagging Windows updates yet again. That sure didn't take long.Â GitHub user Zeffy published a patch that supposedly defeats Microsoft's block, as first spotted by techPowerUp. (PCWorld has not tested this patch.) What the patch boils down to is two flags: IsCPUSupported(void) and IsDeviceServiceable(void). On an unmodified system running a Kaby Lake or Ryzen processor, Windows would discover that the CPU was not supported, and therefore the device was not serviceable. But with the patch applied, Windows is told that everything's fine and the hardware is supported. There's a lot more to it than that, of course, but it all centers around those two checks on a user's system. The down side is that the patch supports a specific set of Microsoft updates. Zeffy also warns that the patch will have to be reapplied any time that Microsoft updates a file called "wuaueng.dll." Zeffy also says the patch is likely to trigger SFC scannow errors--SFC stands for System File Check--because Windows will suspect the system has been compromised since you're messing with system files when using this patch. The impact on you at home: It's possible this could turn into a cat-and-mouse game where Microsoft shuts down the patch and then developers make tweaks to keep it going. That's if Zeffy and others keep working on it, and assuming the code doesn't get pulled from GitHub over legal claims made by Microsoft. If you really feel strongly about not using Windows 10 this patch may be worth it for you. Just be prepared to do a bit of work every month when it comes time to update your system. And don't forget to create a system restore point before letting this patch mess with your system files.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

But sometimes, proprietary software is required.

LibreOffice is the king of free office suites. It's unlikely to replace Microsoft Office in a business environment, but it's an excellent alternative for casual users. Here's what's new in LibreOffice 5.1. Read More — or it could be a proprietary driver. 99% of your hardware will run with open-source drivers, but graphics drivers are another story. Diehard Linux users will accuse you of sacrilege for even thinking about running proprietary drivers. However, if you’re keen on Linux gaming, then they are pretty much required. Why Do You Need Proprietary Graphics Drivers? Almost all Linux distributions ship with open-source drivers. These are provided so that your hardware works out of the box. Install Linux, and use your PC’s hardware as you always had. When it comes to graphics drivers, however, the situation is somewhat different. Open-source graphics drivers will (in most cases) let you run the operating system and perform basic tasks, but when it comes to gaming (and perhaps image/video editing and other heavy lifting) failure can occur. Image credit: Stefan Ledwina via Flickr. The result is that AMD and Nvidia graphics systems can run at a reasonable level with open-source drivers, but need proprietary drivers — those produced by AMD and Nvidia, respectively — to enjoy the power the brands promise. (Intel graphics drivers are already open-source and included with the Linux kernel). Getting proprietary drivers, also known as “restricted” driver, used to be tricky or fiddly, but these days it’s straightforward. Here, we look at installing proprietary graphics drivers on three popular distros: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Fedora. (Proprietary drivers for other hardware devices — such as wireless network interface cards — are also often available.) Pre-Installing Proprietary Graphics Drivers Installing proprietary graphics drivers has become far simpler in recent years. Previously, you may have had to run some specialist software or go looking for the drivers and install them manually. Happily, you can now simply install them as you install your Linux operating system (a feature available in most popular distros). To do this, just work your way through the installation process, paying close attention to the boxes that pop up. Towards the end of installation, you’ll find a dialogue box concerning graphics drivers. This box requires your action, and gives you the choice of installing proprietary graphics drivers or open-source drivers. Choosing the proprietary drivers option will save you the bother of installing them later. Fortunately, this isn’t too tricky. Ubuntu To find proprietary drivers in Ubuntu, open the menu, type “drivers,” and select Additional Drivers. Upon opening, the system will run a quick scan. This will find out if your system has hardware that would benefit from having proprietary drivers installed. It is here that you will find proprietary drivers. It can be tricky to make the right decision as to which drivers to choose, so opt for the defaults (usually the most recent). This method is far more straightforward than using the command line, which can result in problems. Rather than risk system stability (and even your graphics card itself), it is safer to use the Additional Drivers utility. Although you may not be instructed to, it’s often useful to restart your computer after installing a graphics driver. Once rebooted, your Linux system should be ready to offer an enhanced graphics experience! Fedora If you’re running a Fedora system with an Nvidia video card, things are a little trickier. This is because the default repositories for Fedora only list open-source software. You’ll need to begin by checking your video card details: lspci | grep -i VGA If you see details for an Nvidia card, head to the RPM Fusion site and install the free and nonfree packages for your version of Fedora. This should be done via the Firefox browser, using PackageKit to install the packages. It’s also possible to use the command line to install these packages with a single command: sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm Once installed, these packages will add repository information that you can use to search and install the drivers for your card. For Nvidia cards, search for kmod-nvidia. Remember to reboot your PC after this. Have an AMD card? If so, the AMDGPU driver is automatically enabled for newer hardware. Older devices, meanwhile, will have to rely on the Catalyst driver, which is no longer maintained. Linux Mint The main version of Linux Mint is based on the most recent Ubuntu release 5 Reasons Why Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak Is Worth a Look 5 Reasons Why Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak Is Worth a Look A year on from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, a new version has been released. But is the interim release, Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak, even worth installing? Or should you stick with your current Ubuntu version? Read More , and the path to installing restricted/proprietary drivers is the same. However, be aware that there are several variants of Mint 5 Flavors of Linux Mint 18 You Can Try Today 5 Flavors of Linux Mint 18 You Can Try Today Linux Mint is a distro that has roots in Ubuntu but lots of changes that make it worthwhile. In this article, we explore the five flavors of desktop environment that you can try. Read More so you might find that you need to check the correct procedure to get this working. For “mainstream” Mint, open Menu > Administration > Driver Manager, where you’ll find the drivers that you can install. The resulting Driver Manager screen will be laid out in a similar way to the Additional Drivers screen in Ubuntu. Make your choice, click OK, and reboot. In the case of Nvidia cards, you might be offered several versions of what appears to be the same driver. The one you should select will be named something like nvidia-[recent_version]. If it doesn’t work so well, however, you may have to try the nvidia[recent_version]-updates driver instead. When Proprietary Drivers Don’t Help You might have noticed reading the above that you’ve been dealing mostly with Nvidia drivers. Happily, when it comes to AMD video cards, these are (mostly) supported with open-source versions of the Radeon drivers. Better still, they’re incorporated into the Linux kernel. You can find out more about the AMD’s open-source program on their development website. However, there are occasions when proprietary drivers don’t help. Although rare, if you’ve bought a brand-new graphics card Nvidia Graphics Cards: Which One Is Right for You? Nvidia Graphics Cards: Which One Is Right for You? Nvidia graphics cards are the most popular for a reason. But which model should you buy and why? We explain the jargon, the cards, and their performance. Read More , it is unlikely to work with the most recent drivers. In such cases, the best option is to rely on the most recent driver available. And in all cases, in the event of failure, rely purely on the built-in Intel graphics processor until you’re able to resolve the problem. Want to Enjoy Gaming and Multimedia on Linux? You Need Proprietary Drivers! While the prospect of open-source graphics drivers that are of the same quality as the proprietary drivers is attractive, it probably won’t ever happen. Although weaker and older graphics cards are usually 100% supported by open-source drivers, high-end, newer models are not. As such, proprietary drivers are a vital aspect of gaming on Linux. Do you prefer open-source or proprietary graphics drivers? Do you think proprietary drivers should be open-source? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments!

I recently used Kubuntu with an ATI Radeon graphics card and not only I have the default Radeon drivers in the System Settings -> Device Configuration, I also have 2 propriety drivers from ATI installed that I can use already installed and listed in the Drivers list. Of course, the system is set to use the one that is defined as "recommended" and my new graphics card works like a charm. The whole article and the comments are totally out of date. If you can't provide and update to this article why not take it down or rewrite it? Ubuntu has change dramatically over the past few years and it's not nice to present information that is simply out of date. Reply Sue September 6, 2012 at 11:04 pm Hi Danny, There's just one problem -- my screen goes black in the middle of installing -any- GUI on Ubuntu Server 12.04. I think it needs the drivers before installing the GUI. Any ideas how I can load those with access only to a command prompt? Thanks, Sue in Colorado Reply Tina September 15, 2012 at 4:37 am Sue, In case you are still looking for a solution, may I recommend asking a question at MakeUseOf Answers. This is a quick way to receive some ideas. Reply Igor Rizvi? August 1, 2012 at 11:56 pm Good think the default drivers work like a charm since the day one :) Reply Shehan Nirmal May 31, 2012 at 3:05 pm It makes me angry when I cannot install my nVidia graphics card drivers on Ubuntu... So I changed my Ubuntu to Hanthana Linux... A fedora distro... It works great with any VGA card. Reply Rey Aetar April 15, 2012 at 10:58 am it would be nice if an article is posted on how to install proprietary drivers from packages available in the manufacturers web site its relly a headche installing those manually Reply Danny Stieben April 15, 2012 at 6:53 pm Ah yes, a guide like that would indeed help. There are guides out there to do that, but it's always recommended to use the packages meant for a distribution whenever possible. It turns into a massive mess once you install the drivers from their website and then update your kernel. Reply ernestyalumni May 13, 2016 at 2:26 am I've detailed that mess in my own wordpress blog post https://ernestyalumni.wordpress.com/2016/05/07/fedora-23-workstation-linuxnvidia-geforce-gtx-980-ti-my-experience-log-of-what-i-do-and-find-out/ I also explicitly wrote about how I recovered from it by uninstalling and reinstalling from the command line the kernel and video driver. Ugh. Reply Trevor L April 15, 2012 at 12:37 am It would be really nice if card manufacturers supported their products on Linux just a little bit more than they do now. I have no problems with them wanting to keep their code private but I do want my video card to work without the rigamarole of installing proprietary drivers. I just finally got my hybrid graphics running under arch, the only issue I have now is HDMI audio. Reply Danny Stieben April 15, 2012 at 6:53 pm I agree. It's not that it's hard to get it to work under Linux, they just don't care as much. Reply barney April 14, 2012 at 10:36 pm I'll probably get burned for saying it, but the driver(s) issue is why I treat Linux as a toy. It's fun to play with it, but when I have serious work to do, I revert to Windows. Linux is too fractured to have mainstream vendor support. If I have new hardware (or software) that will not function in Linux, then I have to go where it will function in order to get my job(s) done. I have not the skills, nor time to acquire them, to compensate for inadequate drivers of any sort - nor should I have to have them. That's the responsibility of the OS and the vendor(s). Reply Danny Stieben April 15, 2012 at 6:55 pm I know that Linux seems fragmented with all of the different distributions, but they all have at least one thing in common: the Linux kernel. And as far as I understand it, they just need to make it work with the kernel, and it will automatically work with all distributions. Reply Anna Summers October 18, 2016 at 6:38 pm That's the great thing about modular architecture! Maybe someone should tell the hardware manufacturer's that before they have pissed off any more of their prospective customers. Reply Anna Summers October 18, 2016 at 6:29 pm Agree 100% Reply Anna Summers October 18, 2016 at 6:36 pm Agree 100%. As new Linux user, I'm building a Linux machine. I put AMD in my old one, the new one will have Intel, because Intel plays nice with Linux. After what I've read here, nVidia is now also on my no-fly list; I will be buying Radeon instead. Wake up manufacturers - you are losing sales by not providing Linux drivers for your hardware; and that loss will only expand in the future. I will not be disposed in the future to buy hardware from a manufacturer who dissed me today by being slow to provide full-function Linux drivers for their products.

Name: Subject: Message: Huawei admits buying a P10 or P10 Plus is a bit of a lottery Newsby Bogdan Petrovan15 hours ago 91 985 Huawei just admitted what Chinese users of the P10 and P10 Plus have been claiming for weeks. In a statement released in response to an inquiry from Android Authority, the Chinese giant admitted it’s using memory chips of multiple specifications on the recently launched Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus. While Huawei did not go into specifics, empiric checks show that the two phones can feature any combination of LPDDR3 or LPDDR4 RAM chips, and UFS 2.0, UFS 2.1, or eMMC 5.1 storage. “Huawei has employed the standard industry practice of sourcing solutions from multiple trusted suppliers to ensure a balance between user experience, quality and sustainable supply,” the company said. While it’s true that many electronic devices feature a small level of variance when it comes to their components, the differences shouldn’t have a noticeable effect on user experience. One well-known example of component variation is Samsung’s choice of SoCs on its flagship phones, which usually ship with Exynos or Qualcomm chips based on the market. In another recent example, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with modem chips from either Intel or Qualcomm; the latter offer a “significant performance edge” compared to the Intel variant, according to phone testing firm Cellular Insights. LPDDR3 or LPDDR4 RAM? UFS 2.0, UFS 2.1, or eMMC 5.1? Who knows? Huawei insists that it does not make any false claims when it comes to the P10. The company says its marketing makes no mention of the memory generation. “Among all Huawei P10 marketing collateral, there has been no commitment to the use of only one specific flash memory,” it said. That might be true, but the performance difference between LPDDR3 and LPDDR4 chips, and UFS 2.0, UFS 2.1, and eMMC 5.1 storage chips respectively, can be significant. Understandably, P10 customers would like to know if they’re getting an older technology. When it’s convenient, Huawei does advertise the use of LPDDR4 and UFS 2.1 chips. On the Mate 9 product page, for instance, both new standards are presented prominently and contrasted with the older and slower LPDDR3 and eMMC 5.1. It looks like only some P10 and P10 Plus are “born fast.” No mention of the RAM and storage technology can be found on their specs pages. Huawei says it’s using chips “randomly,” based on the component shipments it receives from suppliers. “There are no period batches or manual selection for chip batches,” the company said. What this means is that getting a “good” unit is a matter of luck. You could run benchmarks on the phone prior to purchasing it, but that’s simply not feasible in many cases. Read:  What is UFS storage and why it matters LPDDR4 – everything you need to know Huawei denied any “discrimination or intention to defraud consumers.” “The performance of a single component can’t exactly reflect the overall system performance of a smartphone and these scores are not applicable in actual use scenarios.” Here’s the full statement: “We are aware that there has been some recent online discussion in China regarding the flash memory in HUAWEI P10/P10 Plus. Huawei employs the highest standards when selecting technologies and components for use in its products; we prioritize user experience, product quality and stability of supply. The HUAWEI P Series of smartphones is one of the company’s global flagship series and has become hugely popular worldwide, thanks to the excellent photography experience it provides. This popularity has led to enormous demand. To meet global demand of millions of units, Huawei has employed the standard industry practice of sourcing solutions from multiple trusted suppliers to ensure a balance between user experience, quality and sustainable supply. Relying on a single component supply can lead to a shortage, meaning delays for consumers who wish to buy our new products. In the case of flash memory, in this instance, Huawei has chosen multiple simultaneous mainstream solution suppliers. Huawei is and always has been, above all, committed to providing an extraordinary user experience. The performance of a single component can’t exactly reflect the overall system performance of a smartphone and these scores are not applicable in actual use scenarios. Among all HUAWEI P10 marketing collateral, there has been no commitment to the use of only one specific flash memory. Different flash memory components are shipped randomly based on the supply at that time. There are no period batches or manual selection for chip batches, nor is there any discrimination or intention to defraud to consumers. Our approach is to measure the overall performance of our phones through software algorithms and chip tuning, rather than to focus on any single component. In the HUAWEI P10/P10 Plus, we use multiple different suppliers for flash memory, which have been subject to strict and rigorous testing as part of our finished products, so as to ensure the excellence and consistency of user experience that we strive for. This has been reflected in the overwhelmingly positive worldwide response to the HUAWEI P10 since its launch, thanks to its beautiful design and the stunning artistic portrait photography experience it delivers. Smartphone manufacturing is an industry with a very long supply chain. Huawei is committed to making the user experience the core factor in product design and innovations. We will continue to work closely with our partners to optimize the industry ecosystem and deliver even better products and experiences to consumers.” Let us know your thoughts!

Follow the CAPEX: Cloud Table Stakes The capital expenditures (CAPEX) going into the cloud are Sagan-esque, with billions upon billions being spent on sprawling complexes of interconnected datacenters scattered across the planet. The hyper-scale public cloud operators (Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft) operate BFGCs (big, uh, freakin’ global computers) at immense industrial scale, with townships of well-ventilated warehouses that collectively hold millions of servers, connected by their own transoceanic cables. Just to give a feel, here is a Microsoft datacenter complex in the eastern United States: It seems pretty impressive until you see the expansion under way, which dwarfs the original complex (in the distance at the top of the following picture) and will result in a facility a mile long: Beyond being mind-blowing to people like myself who come from the traditionally asset-light-to-the-point-of-no-assets-beyond-a-couple-laptops software business, the vast sums being spent to move dirt, pour concrete, bend metal, and sling electrons also help us handicap the race for the trillion dollar cloud “jackpot”. CAPEX is not sufficient to win the cloud, but it is surely necessary. Not only is massive CAPEX outlay a prerequisite to offer cloud services globally at scale, but also a strong indicator of on-going success. Customer adoption and utilization necessitate further CAPEX spending. And there are significant economies of scale operating at hyper-scale. You get efficiencies of operation, specify your own highly-optimized and cost-reduced servers and network equipment, get exclusivity on the latest CPUs (and probably soon will just design your own) and increasingly run a private global fiber network so you don’t have to pay telco retail (where there is no Moore’s Law). It is an unprecedented level of vertical integration. And these accumulated CAPEX expenditures, given their sheer scale and the time required to translate balance sheet cash into a global footprint of fully operational and interconnected datacenters, constitute a significant competitive moat. This cumulative investment is a proxy for the size of those moats. This post examines when the hyper-scale players had their “cloud inflection point”, i.e. when they began to devote CAPEX to their cloud, as well as the magnitudes of their cumulative and on-going CAPEX investment. From this analysis we get a sense of just how big a check new entrants will have to write if they want to play this game seriously. Unhelpfully for our task, the cloud players don’t break out their cloud-specific CAPEX. It requires some work, speculation and reading tedious financial documents to glimpse the portion dedicated to cloud as opposed to other investments. Every company at this scale makes non-trivial investments on mundane things like office buildings and other facilities. But each also has CAPEX unique to their businesses. Amazon spends big on warehouses and the robots scurrying around inside. Google has (or at least had) investments in self-driving cars, a veritable air force of flying objects (balloons, drones, satellites), retail fiber networks and one still hopes the odd space elevator that all require some degree of CAPEX. All three companies build hardware products for which they may invest in manufacturing tooling which their outsourced manufacturing partners then operate. Our analysis begins in 2001, as this is the first year for which we have Google CAPEX numbers (a whopping $13 million). We start with the investment section of the cash flow statements in their publicly reported financials. For Amazon and Microsoft we combine the Plant and Equipment line on the cash flow statement with their separately, contentiously and somewhat ambiguously reported capital leases (equipment that is financed and is paid for over time instead of up front, which maps very well to servers that have a limited useful life and are generating revenue over that time, plus we live in a zero interest rate world so why not). While bean counters and finance wonks can argue about the accounting impact of these leases, in real terms they constitute even more CAPEX. Including the capital leases makes the CAPEX numbers significantly higher. In 2016, Amazon did $5.7 billion in capital leases on top of $6.7 billion in CAPEX. We find an extra almost $1.1 billion in CAPEX for Microsoft in 2016 when we check their couch cushions for capital leases. Google does not appear to be using capital leases to fund their infrastructure. The Microsoft numbers have also been mapped from their July to June fiscal year to the calendar year, which the other two companies use as their fiscal year, for a true annual comparison. All three companies show roughly similar trajectories, with annual CAPEX spending in 2016 between $10 and $12 billion. There is some variation from trend around the financial crisis, with Google pulling back sharply in 2009, Microsoft in 2010 and Amazon going parabolic out of the crisis. The magnitude of these expenditures is even more impressive when compared to some of both the biggest companies on the planet and the biggest spenders on CAPEX. It is stunning that Microsoft now outspends Intel on CAPEX. When we look at cumulative spend since 2001 through 2016, the curves are also similar. Google has spent $58 billion on CAPEX since their founding, while over the same time period Microsoft has spent over $48 billion, and Amazon almost $45 billion (though it is the most backloaded): When we normalize against revenue, things are choppier: Google is the biggest relative spender, though fluctuating dramatically from 4% in the aftermath of the financial crisis to as much as 18%, averaging 12% over the entire period. The Microsoft numbers may be the most interesting as they illustrate the transition from an asset-light software company into one with a global cloud footprint, going from under 4% to 12% of revenue spent on CAPEX today. I’m also told these numbers understate the increase as the cloud build-out began while Microsoft was in the midst of a big office building spree, meaning the typical CAPEX for a pure software business is even lower (hmm, Oracle might be interesting to look at in this regard…). Next we’ll drill down on each company. Google Google pioneered the cloud computing model to support their search and ad business, so their cloud inflection point is basically coincident with the company’s inception. It is only much more recently that they have begun to try to dumb down and expose a tiny fraction of their infrastructure externally as a public cloud. Given this data cover almost the entire lifespan of the company, it also includes things like office space for over 70,000 employees (with slides a de rigueur if extraordinary facilities expenditure). Google’s cloud infrastructure supports search, YouTube and a billion some odd Android devices, amongst other things. Google Search is the biggest application in the world, entailing trillions of annual queries against the many copies of the entire Web they store (which they size at a modest 60 trillion URLs). The ad business relentlessly tracks every click by billions of users. YouTube, which Google bought in 2006, serves up millions of hours of video daily and no doubt has required totally insane CDN and network investments, contributing to its continuing lack of profitability. Google Cloud Platform is basically a rounding error compared to these other applications, but nevertheless gets to leverage the underlying infrastructure. Google’s extracurricular “Other Bets”, aka Google “X-cess”, also consume CAPEX. Google started to break out the CAPEX associated with “Other Bets” in 2014. Despite the sheer amount of metal involved in many of these activities, the CAPEX involved is actually a smaller percentage of the overall spend than might have been expected (and this is probably bad news for hopes of a grand societal bargain wherein we accept the all-surveilling eye of Google tracking our every move in exchange for a space elevator). However, CAPEX for “Other Bets” has grown rapidly from $501 million in 2014 to $1.39 billion in 2016 (over 13% of total CAPEX). It will be interesting to see what effect jettisoning various satellite and drone programs as well as approaching “put-up-or-shut-up” time for self-driving cars will have on this spend going forward. It isn’t crazy to think Google may have spent upwards of $50 billion on their infrastructure over the lifetime of the company. No small part of that represents multiple generations of servers and exabytes of disks that have been replaced due to obsolescence and failure, as opposed to purely incremental capacity (so with a three year useful life, Google could have deployed six generations of hardware for some of its capacity). Broadly, Google’s public cloud efforts get to piggyback on these efforts, although they are also making some incremental investments just for Google Cloud Platform. They have had to deviate from their historic and highly centralized “just do it our way” attitude and are investing in smaller datacenters located in more geographies to address data sovereignty demands. While Google faces a variety of challenges in its public cloud efforts, it is safe to say they are much more likely to involve fickle humans, product-market overshoot, and finding the right software face to put on their infrastructure as opposed to infrastructure itself. Microsoft Microsoft’s cloud inflection point is pretty easy to discern. We see two big accelerations in Microsoft’s CAPEX spending. One starts with an perhaps overly optimistic build-out for search in 2005-2009 that got the company cloud expertise and a global infrastructure footprint. The second begins in 2012 and continues to accelerate through 2016, driven presumably by Azure and Office 365. The bulk of that growth is for cloud CAPEX though some may also support the Surface and Xbox hardware businesses. It is notable that Nokia came and went with little or no discernable impact on Microsoft’s CAPEX spend (presumably Nokia had outsourced their manufacturing by that point). Microsoft also has a search business. While they have only a fraction of Google’s queries, it still requires ginormous global infrastructure. Microsoft has spent $43 billion in CAPEX since 2006. Taking a stab and saying 80% of that is for cloud infrastructure suggests a cumulative cloud CAPEX investments of on the order of $30 billion (similarly summing total CAPEX above 2% of revenue yields similar number). Amazon As with all things Amazon, there is frenetic activity on multiple fronts. CAPEX spending barely registers before 2009 and in that year we see the knee of the proverbial hockey stick, with CAPEX growing 40-fold since. This CAPEX explosion includes AWS infrastructure (and Amazon isn’t leveraging an existing search-scale infrastructure, so this spend is driven by AWS), a massive expansion of e-commerce distribution centers to get ever closer to ever more of the buying public, and an office building frenzy that has turned Seattle into the “crane capital of America”. Figuring out how much of this is for AWS is difficult. Amazon, not renowned for its transparency, actually provides a little more breakdown on its CAPEX spend than the other companies, breaking out both capital and build-to-suit leases (hat tip to The Next Platform for charting): Unfortunately, like Amazon’s infamous charts with no units on the vertical axis, this additional information isn’t particularly useful. We can speculate that buildings (datacenters, distribution centers, office buildings, and/or biospheres) are constructed on build-to-suit leases and the computing stuff that goes into the AWS datacenters is purchased via capital leases. Amazon does say about their capital leases: “the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time.” Amazon has spent about $11.4 billion via capital leases since 2009. The challenge is teasing apart what has gone into AWS vs. the traditional Amazon e-commerce business (that AWS now subsidizes). We know AWS has seen explosive growth since its debut in 2006, but so too has the the rest of Amazon which has grown revenue by $115 billion (not including AWS) in the same period. And they have grown their distribution footprint at least five-fold in that time: These warehouses are occupied by at least 30,000 Minion-esque Kiva robots. Even if these robots were funded by capital leases, at a cost on the order of $1000 per robot, they’re not likely to be material. My guess is AWS’ infrastructure spend is on the order of $15 billion between servers and buildings. One area where AWS is behind both Google and Microsoft is owning their own network, which means they are paying a lot more to move bits. Presumably they are planning to rectify this and will add it to their CAPEX spending. We can expect Amazon’s CAPEX investment to continue to grow based on the three vectors above, plus they are opening a new vector as they expand their distribution business with 40 planned air freighters plus long haul and delivery truck fleets (FWIW, FedEx spends $5 billion a year on CAPEX, 10% of revenue). And maybe the Prime Air drones will be more than a PR stunt. Cloud Table Stakes This reading-between-the-lines analysis suggests the hyper-scale clouds collective CAPEX spend on their infrastructure could be approaching $100 billion ($50B for Google, $30B for Microsoft, $15B for Amazon). Given the cloud jackpot is a trillion plus dollar annual opportunity, that doesn’t seem crazy at all. Are there are other estimates or disclosures of CAPEX spend on cloud infrastructure out there? Am I missing anything (e.g. I ignored amortization because I’m interested in the gross spend, not accounting values)? In a future post, we’ll play follow the CAPEX for two companies that keep telling us they are leaders in the cloud contest: IBM and Oracle. The CAPEX will tell us if they have real clouds or are just clowns… Share this: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tumblr Google Pocket Email Print More Reddit Pinterest Posted on April 18, 2017Author Charles FitzgeraldTags Amazon, AWS, CAPEX, Cloud Computing, Google, Microsoft, Space Elevators 6 thoughts on “Follow the CAPEX: Cloud Table Stakes” Richard Hintz says: April 19, 2017 at 1:28 am Why are you assuming Amazon doesn’t own its network? Even if it doesn’t own fiber in the ground or ocean, it may have IRUs, which amount to the same thing. I have no specific knowledge one way or the other, but it’s common for larger network users to get dedicated resources using IRUs. Charles Fitzgerald says: April 19, 2017 at 8:05 am I’m focused on pricing – owning pipes let’s you avoid paying telco retail rates which never come down. How are IRUs priced? Richard Hintz says: April 19, 2017 at 10:44 am IRUs are priced as the market allows and can be difficult to get where capacity is limited. Also, some holders of fiber assets don’t want to lease capacity to a competitor, so there’s that. IRUs are common, though. Another option is a muxed wave on a fiber, which can amount to the same thing, that is, dedicated fiber capacity. So there are at least a couple of ways to get private network capacity, even if you don’t own the actual strands. I’m not sure that Amazon doesn’t own a lot of fiber, especially metro, and we just don’t know it. They aren’t exactly forthcoming, though James Hamilton has mentioned a lot of detail about their interconnections. Charles Fitzgerald says: April 19, 2017 at 3:32 pm Amazon may have some fiber but not nearly as much as Google and Microsoft, which puts them at a relative cost disadvantage. The fact they have complained about telco pricing publicly reinforces this. I am sure they will be spending more here. Richard Hintz says: April 20, 2017 at 4:51 am Reasonable people can differ, but I don’t think complaining about telco fiber prices equates to any conclusions about how much or how little fiber Amazon controls relative to their competitors. I think we just don’t know. It’s common to complain about telco pricing as a sourcing strategy, as with any good where there’s a high barrier to entering the market. Your piece is a useful addition to the discussion. Charles Fitzgerald says: April 20, 2017 at 8:46 am Not sure why we care about telcos’ feelings. One of the areas Google and Microsoft appear to have spent a lot more on CAPEX than Amazon is in owning their own fiber. At the time time, Amazon who say almost nothing publicly about their infrastructure, have complained about their telco dependency. Seems relevant when handicapping the big cloud players’ infrastructure investments and their relative cost structures. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

These new edge security capabilities will be demonstrated at Hannover Messe on April 24. Through an innovative combination of cryptographic security and standards-based identity technologies, ForgeRock Edge Security bridges the gap between device/chip and cloud/web security paradigms with new software that runs on smart edge devices, providing a trusted device identity proofing and registration process. Recent cybercrime and hacking exploits have shown clearly that much of the IoT -- devices, services and applications -- is coming online largely in the absence of adequate security measures due to the weakness of legacy password- and certificate-oriented authentication. ForgeRock Edge Security provides a far superior solution that dramatically increases security by applying identity principles to establish and maintain trust of IoT devices and their communications. To empower partners and end users to leverage ForgeRock Edge Security, ForgeRock announced its Early Access Program. In mission critical environments, ForgeRock Edge Security can also leverage today's leading edge chip security providers, including ARM TrustZone technology, Intel Software Guard Extensions, and Trustonic's chip embedded Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  "Business processes are only as secure as their weakest link. Inadequate password, certificate-based authentication and encryption processes mean that many devices in IoT deployments today are weak links," said Michael Horne, vice president and deputy general manager, IoT Business, ARM. "ForgeRock's new Edge Security offering will enable IoT developers to fully realize the advantages of the ARM mbed™ IoT Device Platform and ARM TrustZone technology." ForgeRock Edge Security includes a ForgeRock Trusted Application (TA) that runs in the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a secure area of the main processor. This allows ForgeRock to establish the all-important hardware root-of-trust on devices, and store cryptographic secrets in the most secure element of the device hardware -- all without using any username/passwords or non-scalable PKI certificates. "We are very excited that the ForgeRock Edge Security solution leverages the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment, which is now available in more than 1 billion smart devices, taking full advantage of the latest security chip technologies such as ARM TrustZone," says George Kanuck, SVP Global Sales and Marketing at Trustonic. To provide business value, IoT devices must seamlessly integrate with the connected world, including clouds, microservices, applications, and their protected APIs, and, of course, people. ForgeRock Edge Security includes a secure IoT message broker to provide client authorization for trusted devices and services, and rich data security using cryptographic secrets to sign and encrypt data for privacy and integrity. As the newest component within the Identity Platform, ForgeRock Edge Security allows organizations to securely and centrally manage digital identities, authentication and authorization for everyone and everything. As ForgeRock Founder and CTO Lasse Andresen describes it: "With the launch of ForgeRock Edge Security, we've extended our leadership in providing secure digital identity from chip-to-cloud, and will enable organizations of any size to provide end-to-end security at enormous scale." In addition to Dell being an early tester of ForgeRock Edge Security, ForgeRock has also joined the Dell IoT Solutions Partner Program. Jason Shepherd, Director of IoT Strategy and Partnerships at Dell said: "Our customers are deploying Dell Edge Gateways in the world's most rugged and industrial environments, so we understand that security and safety should never be an afterthought. We like that ForgeRock takes a purpose-built approach to IoT security, enabling end-to-end trust, so our customers can deploy IoT initiatives with functional integrity and device security assured. We're excited to have ForgeRock on-board as a Dell IoT Solutions Partner and look forward to helping our customers see real ROI from their IoT deployments."

(Reuters//Philippe Wojazer) Share Written by Khe Hy Obsession The Office April 20, 2017 I once had a boss who would send me a series of two-word emails throughout the day, each one bearing the same message: “Call me.” Each time I received one of these emails, the hairs on the back of my neck would stiffen and my stomach would churn violently. This reaction made no sense—I was reliable and organized, consistently ranked in the top performance tier at work. Still, when I saw those ominous words, I feared the worst. When I did call my boss, our conversation was always friendly. It might be that he wanted to get an update on a project, or ask me a quick question, or even compliment me on a presentation. It was almost never bad news. But I still experienced unnecessary stress because of the difference in our communication styles. My manager’s approach was very spur-of-the moment, which made sense because he had many reports and a slew of fast-moving responsibilities on his plate. But I found this style of communication anxiety-provoking; it put me on the defensive, even though I was a responsible worker. Eventually, I realized that there was a solution—I needed to learn more about how to manage up. We typically think of management as a one-way street, with the manager giving “downstream” instructions and feedback to the direct report. But that’s an incomplete way of thinking about this relationship. In the management classic High Output Management, the late Andy Grove, founder and CEO of Intel, said that for one-on-ones to be effective, they should start with an “agenda and tone set by [the direct report].” Peter Drucker, another prominent management thinker, also recommended that employees take the reins when communicating with their managers. His 1954 book The Practice of Management recommends instating “a twice-yearly missive, written to one’s supervisor, (…) for the employee to spell out not only his or her own goals but also what he or she sees as the boss’s objectives.” Inspired by Grove and Drucker’s approaches, I created my own standardized, habitual communication with my boss. My goal was to make sure that we would always be in sync, and that he had an up-to-date understanding of all my projects—which meant that we could cut down on phone calls. The approach was simple. Every Friday afternoon, I’d send my boss a short email with three categories: The work I had completed that week What I was working on, including any deadlines that may have shifted or obstacles I’d encountered What I was waiting on—that is, tasks that I’d completed, but require sign-off from my boss or contributions from someone else Over the years, I refined the practice. I used a timer to ensure that the weekly update would not take longer than 15 minutes to write. I used a simple template where I could pop in information, so as to expedite the process. If you’d like to adopt a similar approach, I’d recommend running it by your manager to ensure that it doesn’t conflict with their preferred method of communication. And every couple months, check-in with them to see if the e-mail is still helpful and how its contents could be improved. It’s all about communication, after all! I’ve employed this practice for over a decade, and when I had direct reports, strongly recommended that they employ it as well. It’s quick, habitual, and if you’ve had a productive week, a great excuse to sprinkle in a humblebrag or two. But most importantly, you’ll save yourself from countless hours of dealing with a churning stomach. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

Shares Whether you’ve been knocked off-line due to the dastardly deeds caused by one of those pesky squirrels chewing on the lines of your power generator, your computer was infected with a nasty virus or ransomware, or you just misplaced your phone for the umpteenth time, then you’ve likely learned a tough but unfortunate lesson about the importance of data access and backup. Take heart; you aren’t alone. According to the experts at World Backup Day, 30 per cent of people have never backed up their data, which is why the organisation promotes the annual observance of World Backup Day (March 31) to serve as a reminder for businesses and individuals to review best practices for backing up and securing their most critical files in order to avoid a data loss disaster.    Backing up data is a crucial part of a disaster recovery plan Human error, technical glitches, cybersecurity failures, natural disasters, and yes, even squirrels, can all lead to a catastrophic loss of data for your businesses. Without safeguards in place, the consequences can be devastating. That’s why every disaster recovery plan must include the use of redundant and highly available infrastructure and the backup of critical data as a part of a secure file transfer system.  While most managed file transfer (MFT) technologies integrate with and leverage a variety of data storage platforms like those offered by Microsoft, NetApp, or Cisco, a high level of responsibility is on the IT staff to make sure all available options have been taken into consideration to ensure the ongoing execution of reliable backups. With so much valuable information stockpiled on our computers—things like personally identifiable information (PII), and corporate intellectual property such as business plans, customer and partner logs, financials, etc.—the stakes are too high for shortcuts.   Six things to remember about developing a backup process  Are your disaster recovery plans up-to-date? Are your valuable files stored safely?  As you answer these questions and evaluate your business’ commitment to your backup practices, here are some important tips to keep in mind:  Create a Schedule – Enterprise or basic backup solutions normally run on a schedule and create copies or incremental updates to a backup set. If a backup schedule hasn’t been created for your business, identify what’s best for you (continuous/automated backup, once a day, twice a day, etc.) so that you can “set it and forget it.” Don’t Forget about your Hosting Operating System – Best practices dictate that your hosting operating system should also be backed up. In most cases the Intel or Windows Server Administration Team has a predefined standard for backup and recovery of the server OS. Check your MFT Configurations/Settings – While MFT configuration and site settings are normally scheduled for backup within the application, you should still verify that keys, certifications, and any special code/scripts are included in the MFT backup; if not included, some items may warrant a special manual backup. You should also investigate options to backup and restore individual items like SSH keys, SSL certs, event processing workflow logic and PGP keys. Data Retention Policy – Many MFT solutions include options to create a data retention policy, which will allow you to remove files of a certain age located in specific folder structures. Use Event Rules – Create archives or backup files as part of your event rule logic to make life easier in the event of an unexpected loss of power or data. Consider the Impact on Storage – Some file transfer solutions require the use of a SQL or Oracle database that also requires backup. The data stored in this database is collected over years and can be very large in size. While it is possible to archive these databases, it’s most efficient to work with smaller databases. A common misconception with any backup process is that, just because you’ve backed up, your data will be safe and secure. Wrong! You’re not done yet.  It’s important to take it one step further and make sure to perform thorough validation and testing to guarantee that when you use your backups, they will actually work. Test, test, and test again. Trusting the safe keeping of proprietary product details, customer history, payment methods, personnel files and other high-value data to a MFT solution managed backup process should include regular maintenance, testing and upkeep. Lost data, lost money: When not backing up your data increases your security risk  Any loss of data is costly, but when those losses are a result of cybercriminal activity, the stakes are much higher. And with an already complex cybercriminal landscape in a constant state of evolution, businesses must plan their approach to data backup not only as a hedge against data theft, but also with cybersecurity roadblocks in mind.   One such threat that has become a major security challenge in recent years is the scourge of ransomware. Ransomware is a relatively new hacking threat where hackers gain access to high-value files, encrypt them, and then demand payment to unlock the files. In many cases a business may not have their data backed up and so paying the attacker may be best—and maybe the only—option. As ransomware attacks become more profuse affecting more and more organisations, victims find themselves giving in to hackers to keep their names out of the press and their customer and partner information private. According to a report published by PhishMe, ransomware attacks grew by more than 600 per cent in 2016 as compared to 2015, at a cost of more than $1 billion to the organisations unfortunate enough to fall prey. The good news is that investment in cybersecurity continues to rise in response to the various threats. However, data backup is far too often treated like an afterthought. And while you may have invested resources into implementing strong security measures, why not include data backup as preventative security measure so that you’re always prepared for the worst? Whether its cybercriminals or mischievous squirrels, we must always be ready for the unexpected because until it’s too late, it’s never too late for data backup.

A new audio driver, available on Windows Update, will now let Surface Studio owners wake their machines simply by saying “hey Cortana.” The new wake functionality is something that Intel’s Skylake processors have long supported, but the Surface Studio is one of the first to support waking from what Microsoft calls a “modern standby” state with the voice command. Microsoft has started supporting this wake functionality as part of the recent Creators Update to Windows 10, and the software maker is planning to enable this Cortana wake functionality in new devices from partners this year. Harman Kardon announced its Cortana-powered speaker last year that will take advantage of Cortana's wake from sleep mode, and it’s the first of many devices that will compete with Amazon’s Echo range. Microsoft’s Surface Studio update also arrives just as the all-in-one PC debuts outside of the US. The Surface Studio launches in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand today, alongside the updated Surface Book with performance base in Austria, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Portwell, which was an early member of the Intel Internet of Things Solutions Alliance, has released several x86-based Internet of Things gateways in recent years (see farther below). Now, the company has launched an ambitious family of highly modular ARM and x86 XM-1 gateways designed to offer a consistent hardware platform that can serve a variety of IoT applications including smart home, smart factory, and smart farm scenarios. The company also launched a line of Arduino-compatible DS-1/DS-1B Wireless Sensor Nodes (see farther below). Portwell XM-1 60xx (left), DS-1 (middle), and DS-1B The initial XM-1 60xx systems have a standard 215 x 163 x 72mm form factor and run Linux, Windows, or Windows CE on a choice of Intel processors. These include single, dual, or quad-core “Bay Trail” Atom E3800, dual- or quad-core “Braswell” Celeron N3000, or dual-core “Broadwell” 5th Gen Core i5 and i3 processors. An upcoming XM-1 variant will also ship with an ARM motherboard, according to Portwell’s April 18 announcement. This may well be a Raspberry Pi, according to a bullet point on a separate product page that says the XM-1 can be designed with a motherboard in various form factors, including Portwell Nano-ITX, Intel NUC, or Raspberry Pi. The XM-1 is “the first IoT gateway to feature international patents of highly composable structure,” says Portwell. The company offers little clarification except to say the XM-1 will provide a “modularization mechanism with patents.” XM-1 60xx detail view (click image to enlarge) The XM-1 design calls for hot pluggable ZigBee, LoRa, WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, or 2G/3G/LTE modules. Wired I/O is also highly modular. The initial XM-1 60xx ships with a standard allotment of a Gigabit Ethernet port and 5x USB 3.0 ports, but these appear to be optional, as well. Other options include 4-port Ethernet and RS-232/422/485. XM-1 4-port GbE The fanless XM-1 systems can be purchased with -40 to 85°C support. It’s unclear if that pertains to the initial XM-1 6060 (Bay Trail), 6061 (Braswell), and 6050 (Broadwell) models, which list a 0 to 60°C range. Other standard features for the XM-1 60xx include up to 8GB DDR3L-1066-1333, a microSD slot, and LEDs and antenna holes. The 12V system ships with an AC 100-240V adapter, and there are power and reset buttons. Desktop, DIN, and VESA mounting are available.   DS-1 and DS-1B Wireless Sensor Nodes In addition to the hot-swappable wireless modules available for the XM-1, Portwell announced a line of somewhat similar looking standalone, Arduino IDE compatible DS-1 and DS-1B Wireless Sensor Nodes. The 95 x 40 x 33mm DS-1 is powered by micro-USB, while the 95 x 80 x 33mm DS-1B integrates dual Lithium batteries that can be charged by micro-USB or solar panel. DS-1 and DS-1B (click image to enlarge) Both models offer the same modular support for ZigBee, LoRa, WiFi, and BLE. They can be configured with different assortments of sensors, including temperature, humidity, UV, light, soil moisture, water, vibration, and infrared. The nodes can control different sensors with different 3V or 5V voltages at the same time. DS-1B mainboard detail (click image to enlarge) The Ds1/DS1B devices are built around an Arduino-like mainboard that runs on an 8MHz Atmel ATmega32U4 with optional 3.3V SPI flash. External I/O is limited to a micro-USB port and a GPIO button, and on the DS-1B, a JST 2.0 solar connector. Internally, there’s a PAN network socket that support the different wireless modules. The devices include 4x jumpers, as well as headers for I2C, SPI, GPIO, and digital and analog interfaces. The 5V, 0 to 60°C ready devices support extreme power saving and sleep modes, and ship with an external antenna.   Other Portwell IoT gateways Portwell also lists some more traditional IoT gateways that are still available. No OS is listed except for the Quark-based PI-81A0, which uses the Linux- and Windows compatible Wind River Intelligent Device Platform. The other two systems likely run Linux and Windows, as well. Portwell PI-81A0 (left) and CAD-0225 (click images to enlarge) Portwell’s other three IoT gateways include: PI-81A0 — The entry level PI-81A0 features a 400MHz Intel Quark X1000 with support for up to 2GB RAM. Other features on the 5V device include dual 10/100 Ethernet ports, USB 2.0 host and device ports, 8-channel analog-to-digital converter inputs, and optional WiFi or “wireless” module. CAD-0225 — Although it’s included on the IoT gateway page, the CAD-0225 is further identified as a network security appliance. The 180 x 150 x 42mm system features an Atom E3800 with up to 8GB DDR3L and 4x PCIe-based GbE ports. There’s also a 2.5-inch HDD, dual USB 2.0 ports, and a serial console port. WEBS-2190 — The industrial focused, Atom E3800 based WEBS-2190 supports -25 to 60°C temperatures, and offers IP40 protection and shock and vibration resistance. You can load up to 8GB of DDR3L, and there’s a microSD slot and 2.5-inch SATA bay. The 12V, 150 x 150 x 53mm system provides 2x GbE, 2x USB 3.0, VGA, DisplayPort, and RS-232/422/485 ports. There’s also a half-size mini-PCIe socket, an antenna socket, an audio jack, and a watchdog. Portwell WEBS-2190 (left) and detail view (click images to enlarge)   Further information No pricing or availability information was provided for the XM-1 gateway or DS-1 and DS-1B Wireless Sensor Nodes. Links to both, as well as the other Portwell IoT gateways listed above may be found on Portwell’s IoT Gateway Solutions page, as well as the XM-1 and DS-1/DS-1B announcement.   Related posts: Nano-ITX SBC and industrial PC tap Broadwell chips OpenWrt-driven LoRa gateways feature indoor and outdoor… Arduino compatible IoT board offers LoRa wireless Qseven COM offers Apollo Lake and a security chip IoT gateway runs Linux on i.MX6UL, offers Thread and ZigBee Wireless IoT gateway features Linux/Java programming stack Wireless-crazed, customizable IoT gateway uses ARM or x86… First Apollo Lake Nano-ITX SBC emerges Yocto-driven IoT gateway does Thread and BLE COM Express Type 6 quartet sings Braswell's praise (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" RX 1440p AMD's new RX 500 series promises affordable, yet capable gaming performance By Rich Edmonds Tuesday, Apr 18, 2017 at 10:06 am EDT 21 Comments AMD has launched a new series of GPUs in the RX 500 family. This new batch of dedicated graphics processing cards promises a butter-smooth 1440p gaming experience at an affordable price. AMD is on a roll as-of-late. Not only has the company pulled things back in the CPU market to better compete against Intel but it's also gearing up for the upcoming Vega announcement to hit back at Nvidia. Unfortunately, while we're still holding off for the latter, AMD has in the meantime decided to launch a new batch of GPUs in the RX 500 series to offer affordable and capable 1080p and 1440p gaming experiences. As noted by Engadget, the RX 480 is more than capable of Virtual Reality and 1080p/1440p gaming, but the RX 500 series of cards will take gaming to 60 frames per second and above. The RX 580, which is the most powerful card in the mid-range series, will be able to achieve this, according to AMD. The company is also releasing the RX 570, 560, and 550. These cards aren't only more efficient than the RX 400 series of GPUs, thanks to being 2nd-gen Polaris chips built on 3rd-gen 14nm FinFET architecture, they're also clocked at higher speeds. It gets interesting when you look at the RX 560, however. This GPU is rocking Polaris 11 and thus enjoys gains in more areas than mere efficiency and increased clock speeds. The 550 is even more unique thanks to sporting Polaris 12. Starting with the RX 580, prices start from just $199 with 4GB of VRAM ($229 for 8GB), while the 570, 560, and 550 will set you back $169, $99, and $79, respectively. Availability commences from today for the 580 and 570, while the 550 comes out on April 20 and the 560 will reportedly arrive in May. If you're holding out for a GTX 1080 competitor offering, we're afraid you'll have to continue waiting for Vega. Still, AMD is killing it in the mid-range sector by bolstering its affordable collection of GPUs.

But the RX 580 actually needs more energy. The whole system with 580 is over 300Watt while with the 1060 just over 200Watt. And even the 480 needs less than the 580. 0 2 days ago Reply Keith Wallace You should research such claims before makign them up. Like was already said, reviews disagree with you. The 1060 more than holds its own against the 580, just as it did the the 480. The performance improvements on the 580 (versus the 480) are minimal, and they come with a severe power penalty at igh load (though power is down under light loads and idle). The 580 does nothing to kick the 1060 to the curb, it just lets AMD have something "new" on the shelf while Vega takes its sweet time. -1 2 days ago Reply Techngro LOL, no, just no. The 1060 beat the 480 easily in the majority of games, and the 580 is literally a few frames faster than the 480. So, while it closes the gap slightly, the 1060 is still the clear winner in MOST games.   -5 2 days ago Reply ogi96 yeah at release.after driver updates...not so much. read some re-reviews before you LOL 2 2 days ago Reply Cryio No, with the 1060 6 GB 9 Gbps ram. 0 2 days ago Reply Kyle Stilkey Just ordered my 580 Sapphire Nitro today. This will compliment my 1700X very nicely. I've been running a 290 since around launch and I'm ready for the upgrade. I would love VEGA but I know it will be out of my current price range. Maybe if I win the lotter or something I'll get one. 3 2 days ago Reply Cryio The 580 isn't that big of an upgrade ... apart for twice the VRAM. 2 2 days ago Reply Hildr It's the 4xx serie renamed and a little boosted (~+5%). RX580 should competes with GTX1060. Not something someone with recent GPU will need cause of the little boost, but can be an affordable upgrade for old ones. 1 2 days ago Reply Apfel Schorle I was waiting for this not because it's a huge improvement to the 4xx series. I was waiting for this because the price for the RX480 and RX470 will drop now. 2 2 days ago Reply Keith Wallace Yeah, these were a letdown. I was going to do a build with one soon. Instead, might as well take a 470 or 480 (which will perform almsot identically) and save probably $30-50. 1 2 days ago Reply Techngro I was in the same boat and feel the same way. I have all of my other parts for my new Ryzen build sitting here and was anxiously awaiting what the 500s would do. Not very excited anymore. I think I'll stick with my 280x for now and then save up for a 1070. 1 2 days ago Reply Keith Wallace Oh, I won't ever go to Nvidia, haha. I got a 460 (to replace my big, clunky 5850) for a short-term card while waiting for Vega. This first build is actually a friend's, and he's doing a fresh Ryzen build. I'm going to check out the 470 and 480 prices and probably pick from those, since you're talking such a small change in performance. For myself, I'll keep holding onto the 460 until Vega drops, then decide. 0 2 days ago Reply drewsuruncle Oh man, I've been debating on a new build. Those prices look so nice! 0 2 days ago Reply Daniel Ratcliffe I'm glad to see this. Can only force NVidia to improve even more. What's not to love? Still hoping for a GTX 1070 myself though. 0 2 days ago Reply Keith Wallace These don't force Nvidia into anything. They aren't as efficient as Nvidia's stuff and they aren't able to compete with Nvidia's high-end products. Vega will have to make Nvidia think, if anything. The 5xx cards do nothing the 4xx cards didn't do already, in terms of promoting competition. There's nothing exciting in this release, just a questionable efficiency move (Better at idle, worse under load) and almost identical performance to the preceding iterations. -2 2 days ago Reply DragonPoo I realise saying this would be over-simplifying a lot, as graphics and computation aren't the same; but when I see a decent GPU and 4GB of GDDR5 RAM for around $100, it really makes me wish it was possible to have a small all-in-one system with similar processing power and graphics for around twice that, $200. 0 2 days ago Reply Cryio The 580 is a 1080p60 card, 1440p with lower settings. 0 2 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Peter Wennink, ASML's president and CEO, told analysts following the company's first quarter financial report Wednesday that the company continues to make progress toward its goals for EUV of 125 wafers per hour productivity and 90 percent light-source availability. Wennik alluded to presentations at the recent SPIE Advanced Lithography Conference from Intel, Samsung and TSMC showing their latest results with EUV systems and the status of the EUV infrastructure. "And while there is still work to be done on things like the pellicle, there appear to be no major roadblocks for EUV insertion in the timeframes as indicated by our customers," Wennik said. After years of often frustrating and painfully slow development, EUV is now poised to be deployed in production in the next couple years beginning with the 7nm node by the likes of Intel, TSMC and Samsung -- all of which invested in ASML as part of a customer investment program to help the company develop the technology. ASML said Wednesday it has an order backlog in the pipeline of 21 NXE:3400B EUV systems—its most advanced EUV tool which started shipping this year—worth 2.3 billion euro (about $2.46 billion). ASML also has 14 older 3300 and 3350 systems in the field, most of which are expected to be upgraded. G. Dan Hutecheson, CEO of semiconductor industry market watcher VLSI Research Inc., told EE Times that ASML's report didn't contain an unexpected news about EUV lithography. "It’s pretty much moving along as planned," Hutecheson said. "Of course, the big issue now is can you get it to where it’s really systematically reliable and have it fully integrated into manufacturing, and that’s what everyone is working on now."

In Q4 2016 and Q1 2017, 35 immersion tools were sold, this is more than the booklog and field EUV tools combined. And this adds to the already hundreds of immersion tools in the field. And we know EUV tools are slower. They can't be used on enough layers to make an impact.

Once upon a time, an all-in-one PC meant weak specs with a high price. They were more like a piece of furniture than a computer.

The model tested contains a B150 chipset motherboard, Intel i5-6500 CPU, Nvidia GTX1050 Ti GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 240GB SATA SSD. The LCD is a 1080p 32-inch curved panel. All fairly stock standard stuff. There’s loads of configuration options on the Pioneer Computers website, including a variety of CPUs, upgrades to RAM and range of additional hard drive options to suit your needs. It’s not surprising there’s so many configuration options, as unlike most all-in-one computers, the guts are not some unique motherboard or parts designed to keep the size down. It’s literally an ITX motherboard screwed in behind an LCD. The GPU isn’t even internally connected to the LCD - a short DVI cable runs out from the monitor’s enclosure, into the GPU’s external monitor socket. There’s a regular SFX power supply and a full size PCIe GPU too.  There’s nothing particularly wrong with this setup, but it is a bit tacky and ergonomically, accessing the ports is a massive pain, as everything faces down towards your desk. At least there’s two USB ports on the side of the display. There’s also no VESA mount options for anyone who would like to hook this up to a monitor arm or mount it on a wall with a bracket.  The upside of this approach however, is that replacement parts should be a piece of cake to find, as there’s nothing proprietary. You can go to your local PC store and pick up bits to replace or upgrade it. An unusual surprise with the DreamVision is a little lever that can be pulled out of the side of the case, which one could assume is an antenna for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but no, it’s simply a place to rest your headphones. Rather oddly, there’s no built-in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The LCD’s quality is nothing to write home about. It looks fine, but it’s a rather low resolution 1080p. Good for TV and games, but not so much for day to day web browsing and productivity. Curved screens are primarily a gimmick at this size, so besides looking cool there’s no real benefit here.  Performance wise, there’s also nothing particularly special. In the PCMark 8 Home Conventional 3.0 benchmark, the DreamVision scores a respectable 3975 and in 3DMark Cloud Gate benchmark, it performs on par with other GTX1050 Ti machines, achieving a score of 17542. Pioneer’s support options are worth a mention too. The standard 1 year return to base warranty is typical of the industry, but for $49 extra, you can add on-site pickup, so you don’t have to pack this big boy up and worry about it in the back of some courier’s van.  There aren’t that many big screen all-in-one PCs on the market. There’s plenty of 24-inch and 27-inch units, but when it comes to displays over 30 inches, the Pioneer DreamVision’s only competition is the very impressive HP Envy 34-A001A, which retails for $3,999 - much more than the Pioneer’s $2,826 for an X32 configured like the HP. Despite the initial cheap feeling of the DreamVision 32-inch Curved All-in-One VR PC X32, it is great value for money if you’re after a big screen all-in-one computer. The 32-inch display makes it perfect to use with a USB TV tuner to sit in a bedroom and be a television, as well as a competent games machine.  Pioneer also sell a non-curved 32-inch LCD all-in-one computer, the DreamVision 32-inch All-in-One Gaming PC 6X, that is a few hundred dollars cheaper, making it a much better buy than this machine. Curved displays just aren’t that amazing to justify the extra cost. But if you actually want an all-in-one computer with a curved LCD it’s going to be hard to find one any cheaper than the DreamVision 32-inch Curved All-in-One VR PC X32.

TIM SHEEHAN tsheehan@fresnobee.com Local April 19, 2017 6:55 PM Columnist Thomas Friedman says big forces are changing things in Fresno and the world By Tim Sheehan tsheehan@fresnobee.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Economics, politics, ethics, employment and communities are being greatly affected by three major global forces – and places like Fresno are squarely in the path of that change. That’s the message that Thomas L. Friedman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times and best-selling author, brought to an audience Wednesday evening at Fresno State’s Save Mart Center. Friedman’s lecture, which was free to the public, was sponsored by The Fresno Bee, Valley PBS and Channel 24 (KSEE). Friedman told reporters before his talk that it would focus on themes in his latest book, “Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist’s Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations.” “What I argue is that it’s actually three big things happening at the same time: Market, Mother Nature and Moore’s Law,” Friedman said. “The market is digital globalization – not your grandfather’s globalization, which was containers on ships and airplanes – the way everything is being globalized and digitized (by) Facebook, Twitter, PayPal, etc.” What I argue is that it’s actually three big things happening at the same time: Market, Mother Nature and Moore’s Law. Columnist and author Thomas L. Friedman “Mother Nature is climate change, biodiversity loss and population growth,” he added. “And Moore’s Law was coined in 1965 by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, who said the speed and power of microchips will double every 24 months. But now it’s closer to 30 or 32 months … and it’s the driver of all technology.” If one were to chart each of these factors, Friedman said, “it would look like a hockey stick” with a sharp rise compressed into a short amount of time. “The three together are what are shaping more things and more places in more ways in more days,” Friedman said. “More technology drives more globalization, (and) more globalization actually drives more climate issues and more solutions to all these problems at the same time.” Friedman acknowledged that he’s not a fan of President Donald Trump, who campaigned last year on a platform to “Make America Great Again.” That slogan would seemingly make Trump no fan of globalization, but “he is – he just wants it to be tilted more our way,” Friedman said. Globalization is a key concern to places like Fresno, Friedman added. “In Fresno, I suspect you’re exporting a lot of agriculture all over the world,” he said. “So this community is deeply affected by all those trends, and the book is really about how all of those trends are reshaping the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics and community.” Because of the changing pace of technology, the days when when someone could make a middle-class living with middle-range skills are long gone, as is the era where one can earn a college degree and remain comfortably in one career with one company for 30 years. “You can still be in the middle class with a high-wage job, but not a middle-skills job,” Friedman said. What digitization and globalization of technology are creating is an employment environment in which workers need to be lifelong learners to keep up with the skills needed for a changing workplace. “If technology is changing every three to five years, we’re required to learn all kinds of new things,” he said. “People need to retool themselves so much faster.” Tim Sheehan: 559-441-6319, @TimSheehanNews LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 5 hours ago New Fresno city manager is named 0:35 5 hours ago New Fresno city manager is named 2:11 6 hours ago Religious leaders hold prayer walk for victims of Tuesday's triple-homicide in Fresno 1:24 9 hours ago In wake of the deadly shooting rampage, Catholic Charities receives $15,000 donation View More Video Local Wind-driven grass fire in Coalinga threatens 40 buildings Fresno police ask for help finding alleged Napa Auto Parts crook Modesto doctors mum on allegations of large fraud, kickback scheme Wilma Quan-Schecter is Fresno’s new city manager, first woman to hold the job Malloch Elementary library technician arrested on teen sex assault charge Local Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery e-Edition Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile Options Mobile Alerts Newsletters RSS Advertising Advertising with the Bee Place Classified Ads Classified Ad Help Local Deals Shopping More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

But there's one area where virtual reality (VR) is lacking: human emotion. The technology doesn't effectively relay nonverbal cues like facial expressions between VR users. However, there's a company that plans to change that. And investors are lining up to get in on the action, investing $100 million in the last funding round. MindMaze, a Switzerland-based tech company founded in 2011, created "MASK," which synchronizes physical emotions with digital emotions. "By syncing the physical body in all its expressive capacity with a digital avatar, MASK allows developers to build playable characters that emote in pre-real-time," MindMaze said on its website. According to TechnologyReview.com, MASK recognizes 10 different expressions, some of which include smirking, grimacing, and eyebrow-raising. And investors are buying into this being the next big trend in VR… In February 2016, MindMaze raised $100 million, led by multinational conglomerate Hinduja Group. That brought MindMaze's valuation to $1 billion. Video MindMaze CEO Tej Tadi Presents MindLeap New technology like this is at the center of the next big trend that Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson is calling Neural Imprinting. In Robinson's 35-year career, he's been a board member of a venture capital firm and an advisor for two more. And he's been watching this trend closely, as some of the most influential companies and investors are rushing to fund this exciting new technology. Microsoft's CEO jumped in with a $150 million investment, saying this technology has "mind-blowing potential." Google headed up a funding round worth $542 million. After spending less than two hours with this technology, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg invested $2.1 billion. By 2020, Robinson believes just one major factor in this Neural Imprinting trend could create $2.86 trillion in new wealth. Here's how you can take part… Watch This One VR Stock Right Now In 2016, Neural Imprinting devices generated $70 million in revenue. For 2017, they could generate $684 million. That's an increase of 877% in just one year. And because this one tiny company in Silicon Valley has 7,300 patents for a key component behind this technology, every major player in tech is beating down its doors. Already, this company has established contracts with Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL), Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC), and Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO). To make things even better, this company has been selected to take part in a $425 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy. Of course, like any investment, there are risks involved. That's why Robinson has thoroughly vetted the opportunity and would like to tell you everything you need to know about this company. But before Robinson's full presentation, we want to make sure Money Morning readers know more about our Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research and his many accomplishments. Who Is Tech Guru Michael A. Robinson? Michael is one of our most prominent and respected investing "gurus" here at Money Map Press – and for good reason. He is one of the top financial analysts working today. Make no mistake: Michael's ideas are completely his own. He's a true original. He works solely for Money Map Press… and receives absolutely no compensation from companies he writes about. His book "Overdrawn: The Bailout of American Savings" was a prescient look at the anatomy of the nation's S&L crisis, long before the word "bailout" became part of our daily lexicon. He's a Pulitzer Prize-nominated writer and reporter, lauded by the Columbia Journalism Review for his aggressive style. Michael's 30-year track record as a leading tech analyst has garnered him rave reviews, too. As editor of the financial newsletter American Wealth Underground, Michael amassed an amazing track record using rigorous investing. The first analyst to uncover the rare earth mineral crisis, he amassed cumulative gains of 990% for his readers in just 16 months. His research is world class, too. The Oakland Tribune, Detroit News, The San Francisco Examiner, The Kansas City Times, Wealth Magazine, and American Banker all publish his reporting. He has appeared on Larry King's syndicated radio show. Robinson has an honors economics degree from the University of Missouri at Columbia with a minor in journalism. And today, we're excited to share his thoroughly vetted opportunity. You can see the full presentation, right here. New Technology Could Create $2.86 Trillion in Wealth: The revenue growth is shocking. Last year, with a very limited release, it generated $70 million in revenue. This year, it's on track for $684 million. But over the next three years, the core technology could create $2.86 trillion in new American wealth. And this isn't just for the billionaires of the world.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Public Safety LTE & Mobile Broadband Market Technology Advancement, Innovation 2016 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts Due to the bandwidth limitations of their traditional voice-centric LMR (Land Mobile Radio) networks, public safety agencies are keen to leverage commercial cellular network technology to support their growing broadband application needs. Considering its thriving ecosystem, spectrum flexibility and performance metrics, LTE has emerged as the leading candidate for public safety mobile broadband networks. In addition, with the recent approval of the MCPTT (Mission Critical Push to Talk) voice standard as part of 3GPP Release 13, LTE has also become an attractive substitute for providing LMR-like voice services. The Qatar Ministry of Interior made headlines when it deployed a private 800 MHz LTE network in 2012. Since then, numerous public safety LTE networks have sprung up across the globe, including the UAE, China, Laos, Turkey and Kenya. Several early adopter LTE deployments are also operational in the United States, as part of the planned FirstNet nationwide public safety broadband network. While most initial public safety LTE investments are limited to small-scale networks, nationwide rollouts in the United States and South Korea are expected to trigger significant large-scale investments throughout the globe. The European market is largely dominated by MVNO arrangements, such as the UK Home Office’s ESN (Emergency Services Network) program that will use EE’s commercial LTE network to deliver prioritized mission critical voice and data services for the UK’s public safety agencies. As part of the program, EE is enhancing its existing network with additional sites, satellite backhaul and a dedicated mobile core for first responders, among other investments. Download Sample Copy Of This Report : www.marketresearchreports.biz/sample/sample/804859 Driven by the thriving ecosystem, SNS Research estimates that annual investments on public safety LTE infrastructure will reach $600 Million by the end of 2016. The market, which includes base stations (eNBs), mobile core and transport networking gear, is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 33% over the next four years. By 2020, these infrastructure investments will be complemented by over 4.4 Million LTE device shipments, including smartphones, rugged handheld terminals and vehicular routers. The “Public Safety LTE & Mobile Broadband Market: 2016 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts” report presents an in-depth assessment of the global public safety LTE market, besides touching upon the wider LMR and mobile broadband industries. In addition to covering the business case, challenges, technology, spectrum allocation, industry roadmap, value chain, deployment case studies, vendor products, strategies, standardization initiatives and applications ecosystem for public safety LTE, the report also presents comprehensive forecasts for mobile broadband, LMR and public safety LTE subscriptions from 2016 till 2030. Also covered are public safety LTE service revenues, over both private and commercial networks. In addition, the report presents revenue forecasts for public safety LTE infrastructure, devices, integration services and management solutions. The report comes with an associated Excel datasheet suite covering quantitative data from all numeric forecasts presented in the report, as well as a list and associated details of over 90 global public safety LTE network commitments (as of Q2’2016). View Full Report : www.marketresearchreports.biz/analysis/804859 Key Findings: The report has the following key findings: SNS Research estimates that annual investments on public safety LTE infrastructure will reach $600 Million by the end of 2016. The market, which includes base stations (eNBs), mobile core and transport networking gear, is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 33% over the next four years. By 2020, these infrastructure investments will be complemented by over 4.4 Million LTE device shipments, including smartphones, rugged handheld terminals and vehicular routers. Following the Qatar Ministry of Interior’s private 800 MHz LTE network deployment in 2012, multiple private LTE rollouts are underway by security forces throughout the oil rich GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) region, including the Abu Dhabi and Dubai police forces. Driven by nationwide public safety LTE network rollouts in the United States and South Korea, the North America and Asia Pacific regions will account for nearly 70% of all public safety LTE investments over the next four years. Almost all major LMR industry players are leveraging partnerships with established LTE infrastructure OEMs such as Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei and Samsung, to offer end-to-end LTE solutions. Consolidation efforts are continuing to take place throughout the industry, particularly among the largest LTE infrastructure OEMs and public safety system integrators.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Gadgets Six things to consider when buying laptops Published April 21, 2017April 21, 2017 Share Tweet Share Pin it +1 We will all need a laptop at some point in our lives, and there are some broad guidelines you should keep in mind when buying a laptop so that you can buy the right one. Here are six of these broad guidelines to help you out: The screen When buying a laptop, be sure to go for one that gives you the best screen within your price range. A good screen typically considers three things: resolution, viewing angles and size. Laptops with higher resolution screens are generally the best ones to choose. For portability, smaller screens are better, but if you intend to use the laptop for entertainment and architectural or artistic functions, then a bigger screen is best. According to Jumia Travel, in terms of viewing angles, a laptop screen that touts IPS (in-plane switching) technology offers the widest viewing angles for the best user comfort. Screen quality You should consider laptops that are comfortable to look at because you are likely to be looking at them for quite some time during the day. Many laptops these days have touch screens, but these touch screens tend to be glossy and glossy screens leads to reflections that negatively affect your eyes. You should, therefore, try to avoid these glossy screens and maybe opt for laptops that aren’t touch screen; but if you must buy one, go for the ones that don’t have glossy screens. Random Access Memory Typically, more RAM is better. For a decent laptop experience, 4GB RAM can be considered, but 8GB RAM is recommended. If you intend to do a lot of video and photo editing, you can consider buying one with 16GB RAM. More RAM allows for more applications to run at the same time, and for more data to be quickly accessible to the system at any one time. When buying a laptop, it is always best to consider the ones with more RAM compared to others within your favoured price range. Keyboard quality It is advisable to choose a laptop with a keyboard that is comfortable for you, rather than one that packs in every key and forces you to start hunting for keys. You should go for a keyboard with a comfortable layout with full sized keys and some space around the arrow keys. The keys should have a sort of ‘snappy responsiveness’ and should be easy on your fingers. When buying a laptop, it is best to get a feel of the keyboard rather than ‘buying blind’ (asking someone to buy it for you or ordering online). Central Processing Unit Intel’s Core-based CPUs are one of the best to consider when buying a laptop. Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 offer some of the best performance when it comes to multitasking and multimedia tasks. However, for Core i7-based systems, though they offer the best performance for your laptop, the heat emitted from the base of the laptop tends to be a cause for concern if you plan to use the laptop for a long time. Battery life Pay attention to the rating of the battery in Watt-hours (Wh) or milliamp-hours (mAh); typically, the larger the figures, the longer the battery can last. Copyright PUNCH.

The White House announced that the president is keeping his promise to make America first by proclaiming that the policy of the executive branch is to buy American goods and to hire American workers. In addition, the executive order tells the four government agencies that handle the guest-worker visas to do a complete review of the core programs. The White House indicated that the president wants to see whether or not any programs discriminate against U.S. workers and, if so, what changes need to be made. Speaking aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, the senior administration official answered press questions regarding the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order. That official did not give a specific time frame for completion of the departmental review. “When a President issues an executive order and it says ‘move as soon as practical,’ then that,” he said, “is what is going to happen.” The official told the press that the president wants to find ways “to avoid allowing guest workers to be used at beneath-market pay” and that an executive order “is a very muscular way of getting the agencies to begin that process.” An April 18 press statement from the White House specifically mentions the H1B visa. The H1B allows non-farm foreign skilled workers to take jobs in the U.S. These jobs are not seasonal and workers can stay longer, even reapply. Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, Qualcomm, Apple and Google are among companies that take advantage of the H1B. How does an employer hire a foreign worker? First they have to prove they can’t find American workers to fill the positions and then make the request to the Department of Labor. The DOL certifies the pay rate, so American workers don’t get undercut. The program has always been controversial. While many companies could not stay in business without the program, unscrupulous company owners and scheming staffing agencies are well known for their abuses. Some business owners claim they can’t hire dependable employees and must turn to foreign labor. Critics claim the program undermines American workers. While there’s a multi-layered chart of visa types, 76 in fact, the H2A and H2B are two much-used types of visas that allow foreign workers – not immigrants – to legally work in the U.S. The H2A visa is for foreign workers that can be hired to work seasonally for farms, ranches, fruit growers and others with general agricultural seasonal needs. Trump has not made reference to this visa. The H2B program is the blue-collar version of the H-1B visa outsourcing program. The number of H2B visas is capped at 66,000 per year. The program offers temporary and seasonal jobs for “unskilled” labor, up to 10 months at a time. The largest employer of these temporary workers is the landscaping industry, followed by the crabbing industry, vacation resorts, fishing industry, forestry operations and others. Companies that use the H2B program to hire foreign workers also include trucking companies. Trump has yet to specifically mention the H2B visa program.

They praised Zephyr, but dinged the review tools and governance. The Linux Foundation’s open source Zephyr Project received considerable attention at this February’s Embedded Linux Conference (ELC). Although there are still no shipping products running this lightweight real-time operating system (RTOS) for microcontrollers, Fabien Parent and Neil Armstrong of the French embedded firm BayLibre shared their experiences in developing a wearable device that may end up being the first Zephyr-based consumer electronics product. BayLibre’s device has an ARM Cortex-A SoC connected via an SPI bus to a Cortex-M4 STM32L4xx. This is linked via I2C to other, more lightweight Cortex-M cores. Parent and Armstrong could say no more about the design, but they explained why they chose Zephyr and discussed the project’s pros and cons. Neil Armstrong reveals basic architecture of BayLibre’s wearable (click image to enlarge) Parent and Armstrong needed a free, permissively licensed RTOS for a small-footprint wearable device, and they required drivers for UART, I2C master, and SPI slave. They also needed features like a scheduler, timers, tasks, threads, and locks. The list was quickly narrowed down to the Apache 2.0 licensed Zephyr, the 3-clause BSD licensed NuttX, or rolling an OS of their own. After having already committed to Zephyr, Apache myNewt launched, and they realized this might have worked, as well. Parent and Armstrong first considered the DIY approach. “Developing our own OS had the advantage of being fun,” said Armstrong. “It could be tailored to our needs and our development process, and we would better understand the entire code base. The drawback is that it takes time, and there is no community to help. It would be hard to maintain, and there would be little time to mature and fix the bugs.” With BayLibre’s customer deadline essentially negating the homegrown option, the developers looked into NuttX, which had the advantage of being around longer than Zephyr. Although Parent and Armstrong were embedded Linux developers and fairly new to RTOSes, Parent had become familiar with NuttX from working for two years at Google’s recently abandoned Project Ara. NuttX is best known for running on Pixhawk drone controllers. “NuttX had the advantage of being familiar, and it already supported our STM32L4xx SoC,” said Parent. “But the build system is completely unreliable. At Project Ara, whenever we changed the configuration, we could not be sure it would work. Also, there’s no real NuttX community — it’s basically one guy who wrote almost everything, and there is basically no peer review.” Finally, despite NuttX’s BSD license, “inside its repository there is a lot of code with licenses such as GPL, so there’s a chance you might accidentally include some, which is scary,” added Parent.   Zephyr pros and cons Zephyr had only been announced a few weeks before they began the project, yet it already had several appealing features. “It’s much like Linux in the coding style, build system, and the concept of maintainers,” said Armstrong. “Zephyr also has great documentation, and they are quickly growing a strong community. Zephyr supports low memory usage, and it’s highly configurable and modular. It offers modern cooperative and preemptive threading, and will eventually add security pre-certification.” At the time, Zephyr’s biggest drawback was its immaturity, and the fact that it did not support the STM32L4xx SoC, only an older STM32F1xx model. The latter turned out to be a much easier challenge than they had imagined. The SoCs turned out to be very similar, so updating the port took only a day and a half, with testing finished within a week. “Most of the time was spent on I2C and SPI, and debugging a stupid register issue,” said Armstrong. Zephyr’s accelerated schedule vs. Linux. Parent: “As soon as you have clean code, try to upstream it.” (click image to enlarge) The challenges came with the upstreaming process itself, and the fact that Zephyr was changing so quickly. “We made the bad choice of waiting a month before upstreaming the code,” said Parent. “When we did the first rebase, nothing worked, and we had to rewrite the power management code three times. As soon as you have clean code, try to upstream it. Otherwise, you will spend hours rebasing everything.” The upstream patch review process, which is now undergoing revision, was also more cumbersome compared to Linux. “Zephyr uses Gerrit for patch review, and JIRA for the feature requests, and there’s also a mailing list,” said Parent. “Sometimes you don’t know where to look for answers.” Gerrit makes it easy to not forget patches, but “it’s really slow, and is very complicated,” said Parent. “One of the biggest issues is that you have to individually select the reviewers instead of broadcasting. There is no concept of patch series, so you have to add topics to your patch series, which makes sending patches more complicated. Its archive search is really bad, and it’s really hard to get a full view of a patch.” JIRA also posed some challenges. “JIRA is manager friendly and makes it easy to do graphs, but it’s not developer friendly, and there’s no good information on how to use it,” said Parent. “It’s yet another communication medium that is overlapping with mailing lists and Gerrit.”   A HAL of a surprise Parent and Armstrong uploaded the ST port patches to Gerrit and waited for reviews. There was no response, but they kept pinging the maintainer on IRC. They waited almost a month for a review response, and when it came it was rather vague. They also received a discouraging note from a Zephyr developer from a large corporation. “He said please stop your work because we want to push our own HAL to Zephyr based on the STM32 Cube SDK,” related Armstrong. “He said that after he did his proposal we could redo our patch.” They were surprised about the acceptance of HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) technology. “Our patch was fully rewritten in native code with no external links to anything,” said Armstrong. “We were used to the Linux kernel, where you can only have native, maintainable code. And the maintainers never told us from the start about HALs.” “There was a discussion on the Zephyr mailing list as to whether we should use HALs before moving to native code,” added Parent. “Input was requested from the maintainers, but there was no reply. Right now, most of the Zephyr maintainers are from SoC companies. The result is that vendor HALs are slowly replacing native drivers, or at least for ST. Personally, I would love to not have HALs.” Parent noted that the Linux kernel project prefers that their top-level maintainers do not work for SoC companies. He asked Linux DRM maintainer Dave Airlie about the situation, and Airlie was quoted as saying: “The reason the top-level maintainer (me) doesn’t work for Intel or AMD or any vendors it that I can say NO when your maintainers can’t or won’t say it.” Parent also suggested that the Zephyr Project is not as transparent as some other open source projects. The technical leadership is determined by voting members of the Zephyr Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC is open to community members to participate, but you must be invited to attend the meetings. “Most meeting minutes require permission to access, and it can take up to two weeks,” he said. “Decisions are spread across JIRA, Gerrit, and the mailing lists, and blog posts are controlled through a separate committee, which makes it kind of hard to post a blog.” There are also challenges in working with a new project driven by “top-down development,” said Parent. The priorities appear to be planned features like a Unified Kernel, a new IP stack, and Thread protocol support, he added. “They need to clarify their priorities and let us know if planned features have priority vs. community contributions.” In conclusion, Armstrong summed up their first Zephyr experience. “We don’t like the HALs, and the review tools made us really sad,” he said. “The code is still really young and the APIs change fast, so you need to test your code for every release to see if it’s still working.” Yet, Armstrong also emphasized Zephyr’s advantages, not least of which is the fact that it’s one of the few open source RTOSes optimized for wearables. “Zephyr is a good design for low memory or low performance on small CPUs,” said Armstrong. “It’s really similar to Linux, and the APIs are simple and well documented. There’s a real and active community, and the flaws are getting fixed very quickly.” Armstrong also noted a possible improvement on the reviews front: “There was a rumor this morning that Zephyr is moving from Gerrit to GitHub,” he said. “It’s not perfect. but it’s better than Gerrit for sure.” Other Zephyr sessions from ELC 2017 now available on YouTube include: Intel’s Anas Nashif summarizes Zephyr’s progress, as well as plans for next year. Linaro’s Andy Gross talks about plans to integrate device tree in Zephyr. Intel’s Marcel Holtmann discusses using Zephyr on the BBC micro:bit board. Intel’s Sakari Poussa explains how to jumpstart Zephyr development by using JavaScript Runtime for Zephyr, including a “shell” developer mode and Web USB. ARM’s Vincenzo Frascino, who works on the Linaro LITE group, describes how Zephyr runs on the ARM Beetle test-chip implementation of the IoT subsystem for Cortex-M processors. Intel’s Johan Hedberg discusses Zephyr’s Bluetooth support, including its IPv6/6LoWPAN stack for implementing IPv6 over BLE and the emerging Bluetooth Mesh.

I am very careful with licensing and if there is ANY GPL code in the components that link together to produce that NuttX binary, that would be a MAJOR screw-up and I would most certainly like to know about it. Unless someone can point out the case, I believe that the statement is false. If you can find such a case, the GPL code will be removed immediately. There are some GPL tools in separate repositories that are not linked to produce NuttX. These I know about, but that is a different story. Greg Nutt Reply Gregory Nutt says: Apr. 20, 2017 at 5:35 pm The other statements are basically true. If you use a new, unverified combination of features you will likely have to invest some of your time making it work. And, yes, there are many, many contributors to NuttX but there is only me behind the desk. Greg Reply Please comment here...

The 2-1 vote is a blow to companies such as Sprint Corp and others that claim prices for business data are too high and backed a 2016 plan under former President Barack Obama that would have cut prices. It marked a significant step in FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's aggressive agenda to roll back many existing telecommunications rules and Obama era regulations. Small businesses, schools, libraries and others rely on business data services, or special-access lines, to transmit large amounts of data quickly. The services are used, among other applications, to connect banks to ATM machines or gasoline pump credit card readers. Wireless carriers rely on them to get data from an end user to a node in a major network or the so-called backhaul of mobile traffic. Thursday's vote scrapped most regulatory requirements in the business data services market, although some price caps in areas with little competition will be retained. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who accused her Republican colleagues of siding with "the interests of multibillion-dollar providers," said the ruling "opens the door to immediate price hikes" to small businesses. The rule deregulates pricing in a majority of counties and more than 90 percent of buildings using the services. Pai defended the decision, saying regulatory requirements had threatened competition and investment. Pai plans as early as next week to unveil plans to dismantle the Obama administration's "net neutrality" rules, even as he favors a free and open internet under a different regulatory scheme. He declined to discuss his plans, but said he had met this week with executives at Facebook Inc, Oracle Corp , Cisco Systems Inc and Intel Corp to discuss internet issues. In recent days, the independent Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy, the European Union and Democratic members of Congress have raised concerns about the lifting of net neutrality rules. Under Obama, then FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in April 2016 proposed a sweeping reform plan for business data services that aimed to reduce prices paid. Wheeler had proposed maintaining and lowering lower price caps using legacy data systems with a phased-in 11 percent price reduction. Sprint, which backed Wheeler's proposal, told the FCC in a March 22 letter that "thousands of large and small businesses across the country were paying far too much for broadband because of inadequate competition." CenturyLink praised Thursday's decision as something that aligned regulations with "competitive market realities." Comcast Corp said the vote would help minimize "burdensome and investment-killing regulations, specifically on new entrants." Advocacy group Public Knowledge said the decision "doubles down on incumbent market power, forcing businesses, hospitals, schools, and ultimately consumers to pay more for essential connectivity."

List your Business on Economictimes.com for Free & Grow your Business List Your Business Find Service Near You Last month Andhra Pradesh's coastal city Visakhapatnam, or Vizag, was buzzing with financial technology startups showcasing products, competing in front of various stakeholders and help ring in Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's vision to make Vizag the fintech hub of India. "By 2019, Vizag will become the financial technology hub of India and by 2023 it will become the financial technology hub of the world," said Naidu presenting his optimistic outlook. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were restarting life as independent states missing the start-ups, innovation and disruption boom set across the country. "When a state is bifurcated, economic advantages and disadvantages are divided between the two states," said professor K Nageshwar, political analyst and editor of the Hyderabad-based Hans India newspaper. "When the IT sector is concerned, the entire advantage went to Telangana through Hyderabad." He further added that Vizag doesn't have the technological foundation Hyderabad does. Naidu, former chief minister of united Andhra Pradesh, played a major role in bringing Hyderabad to the map as a major IT hub. Now he has to recreate the same magic without Hyderabad. Though many believe that while Hyderabad has an advantage over Vizag, the city [Hyderabad] nevertheless missed out on opportunities due to the political upheaval leading up to the bifurcation of united Andhra Pradesh. "Hyderabad took a massive backseat during that time — everyone acknowledges it, including the government," said Srinivas Kollipara, COO of T-Hub, the Telangana government-backed startup incubator. "There was instability, bandhs all the time — the start-up activity came to a halt for almost four years. Before the political upheaval, I don't think Hyderabad was too far behind Bengaluru." In 2014, the year of bifurcation, Hyderabad founded 340 start-ups, according to the data-tracking platform, Tracxn. Presently, the city boasts of a total 1895 startups founded till date and a state government which has made innovation as one of its priorities. Hyderabad has the advantage of leveraging the infrastructure and the IT industry already established, while for Vizag it is being built one block at a time. Vizag has only founded 57 start-ups till date and Naidu intends to change that. VIZAG, THE FINTECH CAPITAL? After a series of experiments, Andhra Pradesh government recently adopted a single-sector focus approach by taking up the ambitious task of turning Vizag into the fintech capital of India, a title currently reserved for Mumbai. "Financial technology is growing at 26% the world over, which made it the obvious choice of focus for us," said JA Chowdary, IT advisor to Naidu. "We will make Vizag, which is our business capital, into the fintech capital." The Vizag event saw the fintech stakeholders from the across the globe converge. But how does the government plan to achieve their vision of making this city a hub of financial technology? The first leg of this process includes creating manpower. The state has signed MoUs with HSBC, Thomson Reuters and Visa to set up financial technology academies within the current academic institutes in the city. "We have to get senior and most established people from the industry to Vizag and only then would we be able to attract investments and create a fintech ecosystem," said Chowdary. The state is inviting established fintech startups and companies to set up their centres in Vizag — with online payment company Paytm being one of them. "We sincerely appreciate Mr Naidu's efforts to develop Vizag as a fintech valley by offering world-class infrastructure, important facilities and necessary guidance to companies like ours willing to set up offices in the city. This will go a long way in setting up an industry-friendly environment at par with metropolitan cities," said Amit Sinha, senior vice president, Paytm. The government also plans to set up a repository of use cases to provide startups with its lifeblood. "Use cases are what startups would need to survive," added Chowdary. DOES VIZAG HAVE WHAT IT TAKES? "Fintech is scattered around in India. Other countries like Israel and Australia have one specific hub for fintech. India doesn't have an equivalent of that. Vizag could be the one for India — and Mumbai and Vizag could have a twin city approach. They could be virtually connected. Fintech needs an ecosystem — Vizag can provide that by bringing all the stakeholders together," said Neha Punater, partner and head of Fintech at KPMG, which was involved in organizing the Fintech Valley Conference in Vizag last month. But there are others who are not as optimistic. An expert from one of the big four accounting firms is not too convinced Vizag has it. "While it may be a good idea to bring necessary fintech stakeholders to Vizag, accessibility is an issue. What would make them drag themselves to a small city in India for financial technology now that the entire world is virtually connected? I don't see a good frequency of flights to Vizag, which is not the case with other cities like Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi," said the analyst, requesting anonymity. Professor Nageshwar echoes similar concerns. "You may have a leader in Chandrababu Naidu. But political leadership and business policies are just one aspect of developing an economy," he said. Connectivity and climate conditions are other factors that contribute to the growth of a sector in a state, he added. "AP can focus on logistics, agroprocessing, and food processing. They have more promise in these areas and should capitalize on the same," said Nageshwar, though he feels the idea of making Vizag a fintech hub is a good one. He just fears the state should not put all its eggs in one basket. This is why Hyderabad's T-Hub, which runs a host of corporate innovation programs with companies like Intel, Qualcomm, and Novartis, among others, has decided to diversify its bets. "It's a little too early to say what Hyderabad would be known for. However, agriculture and life sciences seem like the ones standing out. Also, smart cities and IoT (Internet of Things) are what the state government is focusing on, so those could be sectors of expertise as well,” said T-Hub’s Kollipara, who believes that the startup ecosystem in the city has come alive in the last two years. "It's not just T-Hub. The city has so many incubators and co-working spaces that have come up in the last two years." Telangana government is trying to reshape the Hyderabad start-up ecosystem after Silicon Valley — bringing together academic institutes, start-up incubators, and mentors. "We have invested Rs. 40 crores in the first phase of T-Hub and Rs 180 crore for its second phase. A lot of states may talk about helping start-ups, but which other state has put over Rs 200 crores in startups?" questions Telangana IT secretary Jayesh Ranjan. The state also set up a Rs 100 crore fund for start-ups with a fifth of its money from the state government. "AP tried to come up with a startup incubator called Sunrise Village, but it comes as no surprise that it has been shut down now," added Ranjan. "The cities are moving in the right direction, but it will surely take time. Such visions are usually 5-10 year plans and not short term," said investor Sateesh Andra of Endiya Partners, the Hyderabad-based early-stage investment firm which has only two companies from the city in its portfolio of six. While it can leverage the presence of companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, among others, Hyderabad does have its share of challenges. "In every start-up ecosystem, one company has done very well and helped the others out. Chennai had Zoho. It was the semiconductor companies in the US. Hyderabad doesn't have any such company yet. That is a major challenge. We need to find our Zoho," said T-Hub's Kollipara. SO, WHO IS LIKELY TO WIN? As both the state governments go all out to make up for the lost time and become prominent players in the start- ecosystem, it remains unclear if they will succeed. Hyderabad's already established infrastructure gives Telangana an edge over Vizag, which is starting with a clean slate. However, Andhra's Naidu has the legacy of accelerating development of a city, which makes his vision of making Vizag the fintech hub plausible. When it comes to IT, Professor Nageshwar believes that Telangana and Andhra Pradesh cannot compete. He said that Naidu doesn't have the same advantage he had with Hyderabad during the 1990s. "IT was an upcoming industry at that point. However, Naidu has to build it now in a saturated IT economy. Vizag doesn't have the IT strong foundation like that of Hyderabad."

X Investor MML buys €12m stake in Fastway Couriers Firm delivers for Littlewoods, Boohoo and Missguided and other organisations about 13 hours ago Barry O'Halloran Fastway delivers through a franchised network of about 300 drivers around the Republic. Photograph: Getty Images         Irish and multinational-backed investor MML has bought a minority stake in Fastway Couriers for a figure said to be about €12 million. Fastway delivers for online retailers such as Littlewoods, Boohoo and Missguided, small businesses and other organisations, through a franchised network of about 300 drivers around the Republic. It also owns the Parcel Connect drop off and collection service. MML, whose backers include Enterprise Ireland, AIB, US-based Cigna Corporation and the European Investment Bank, has invested in the business alongside chief executive, Bobby O’Keeffe. The fund has taken a minority shareholding – thought to be more than one third – of the five key companies that make up the group, including Fastway’s Dublin regional franchise, its sorting facility, logistics network and Parcel Connect. It is understood that it spent a figure somewhere in excess of €10 million buying the stake. MML generally invests up to €12 million in the companies in which it buys shares. The move has paved the way for two of Fastway’s original shareholders, Gerry Riordain and Andy Hennessy, to cash in their investments. Mr O’Keeffe intends to re-invest in the business, which he says needs to continue to adapt to its customers’ needs. He said that customers wanted to receive deliveries at their convenience rather than at a time and place that suited the courier. “If you look at the e-commerce market it is changing at a rapid pace,” he said. “Customers want to get control of their deliveries, they don’t want their deliveries controlling them; that requires a lot of innovation.” Mr O’Keeffe and Fastway Couriers Ireland developed Parcel Connect, which allows for deliveries to be dropped off and collected through a network of 1,000 convenience stores around the Republic. Fastway’s original franchisors in New Zealand and Australia have since taken the idea and adapted it to their businesses. Couriers in the UK use a similar model developed at around the same time as Parcel Connect, according to Mr O’Keeffe. The franchise began in New Zealand in 1983 and spread to Australia and South Africa before arriving here in 2001. Mr O’Keeffe became interested while he was working for tech giant Intel. He invested in the midlands regional franchise in 2002 and in Dublin three years later. He subsequently left Intel and joined Fastway, becoming chief executive in 2009. Fastway hired accountants Mazars last June to aid it in finding new investors. The firm advised Fastway on the deal, while AIB Corporate Banking provided some finance. MML Growth Partners Ireland is a €125 million fund specifically focused on small and medium-sized businesses. It typically invests between €2 million and €12 million in each company. Neil McGowan, a director and the firm’s co-head of investment, said that Fastway was “growing very quickly against the backdrop of a rapidly changing and developing e-commerce retail space”.       Topics: Andy Hennessy Bobby O Keeffe Gerry Riordain Neil Mcgowan Enterprise Ireland AIB Boohoo Cigna Fastway Intel Littlewoods Mazars Missguided Mml Growth Australia Dublin(IE) Ireland New Zealand South Africa United Kingdom Read More Rival to An Post promises to give 20% discount Carlow’s Netwatch taps into US demand for remote security Future Proof: Stables pulls a stunt to beat recession One51 sells ClearCircle for €30m ‘Twitter is like word of mouth on speed’ Japanese firm buys Northern Irish security systems firm UDG expands capacity in US and UK for healthcare services firm Angels could invest €85m in Irish start-ups after ‘record-breaking year’ Teneo Holdings to combine its two Irish businesses Paddy Power Betfair chief executive gets £798,000 bonus  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy State opens new avenue to raise money ahead of €29bn refinancing Work Strategies so you are not adding to unnecessary workplace stress Rugby Liam Toland: Stop the Vunipola boys and you stop Saracens Manufacturing Accounts show Vita Cortex group had net losses of €2.3m Sponsored ‘I just love it, it’s a lovely place to work,’ says ‘Burlo’ concierge The Story of Home: the designer self-build Ten thrifty tips to brighten up your home Let a Hume PhD scholarship unlock your potential at Maynooth University Latest Business Tobacco company fails to offset decline in cigarette demand 07:56 Durex maker reports flat like-for-like sales in Q1 07:40 Philips Lighting Q1 earnings beat 07:18 Strategies so you are not adding to unnecessary workplace stress 07:09 When nudging staff pushes them to do more 06:59 Most Read in Business 1 Prominent Dublin pub baron’s group to open other new boutique hotels in 2018 2 Finding a fair way to compare public and private pay rates 3 Electricity users shoulder €400m burden of renewables scheme 4 Tesla to recall 53,000 cars over parking brake issue 5 Trump order on steel imports review sparks fears 6 State opens new avenue to raise money ahead of €29bn refinancing 7 Strategies so you are not adding to unnecessary workplace stress 8 EU shuts British firms out of contract bids 9 Russian bank bankruptcy renders Irish bonds worthless 10 So what do multinationals look for when hiring new recruits?

A Global Industry First: Industrial Internet Consortium and Plattform Industrie 4.0 to Host Joint IIoT Security Demonstration at Hannover Messe 2017 Download Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 20, 2017 01:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time HANNOVER, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) and Plattform Industrie 4.0 are pleased to announce their plans to host a joint demonstration at Hannover Messe, April 24-28, 2017, in Hannover, Germany, highlighting Industrial Internet security, interoperability and collaboration. With the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industrie 4.0, manufacturers are adding more connected devices, sharing operational data with IT systems within both their own factories and businesses, as well as extending information exchange across their entire value chain. This increased digitization offers a host of benefits to manufacturers, their partners, suppliers and customers. In a connected world, this robust connectivity amplifies the importance of security both within a single manufacturer’s plant and across every participant in the value chain. There is no single, homogeneous security environment; rather there are multiple companies and systems that need to work together. The joint real-time demonstration at Hannover Messe shows how the IIC’s recently released Industrial Internet Security Framework and the concepts of secure cooperation in cross company environments developed by the Plattform Industrie 4.0 can be applied to solve this challenge. Mimicking a real-world, multi-vendor, distributed environment, the demonstration integrates Hannover Messe demos from over 20 IIC member companies and Plattform Industrie 4.0 partner companies respectively into a single security demonstration. It spans multiple booths at Hannover Messe and remote sites around the world. The IIC and Plattform Industrie 4.0 have been collaborating for just over a year to combine the cross-domain approach of the IIC with Plattform Industrie 4.0’s focus on the manufacturing industry. The concept of this demonstration was launched only four short months ago. The demonstration highlights how multiple unique, existing security systems can be consolidated in a set of interacting industrial security systems, leveraging products and technologies available today that demonstrate secure integration of existing systems without disrupting operations. Security events are shared across the entire ecosystem, letting each member in the value chain see all security events that are relevant to them. “It’s really terrific to see so many global IIC members from multiple disciplines, working together with Plattform Industry 4.0 to achieve this industry first manufacturing-based real-time demo in a secure environment,” said John Tuccillo, Chair of the IIC Steering Committee, and Senior Vice President, Schneider Electric. “The joint demonstration is an important milestone in our cooperation. It shows that the exchange between the partners creates practical and transferable solutions. We are very thankful to our Joint Technology Group Security for this successful work,” said Henning Banthien, General Secretary of the Plattform Industrie 4.0. “Security is critical to industrial deployments and the Hannover Messe demonstration highlights the fact that deploying a robust industrial security monitoring solution in a heterogeneous environment across multiple companies and organizations can be achieved using today’s technology,” said Sven Schrecker, Co-Chair of the IIC Security Working Group and Chief Architect, IoT Security Solutions, Intel. “Our work result illustrates: secure data exchange across domains can be done. This means a central precondition for secure cross-company value networks is met,” adds Michael Jochem, Robert Bosch GmbH and Chair of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 Working Group Security of Networked Systems. Live Demonstration at the Hannover Messe The central presentation can be found in Stands C24 and D24 of Hall 8 of Hannover Messe and live demonstrations can be found in many participating member stands and halls throughout the event, in other parts of Germany and in other parts of the world. There will be a joint press conference on April 25, 2017 from 9 – 10 am CET at the Hannover Messe, Convention Center, Saal 15. You can join the live telephone conference via this link where you can submit written questions.

The joint real-time demonstration at Hannover Messe shows how the IIC’s recently released Industrial Internet Security Framework and the concepts of secure cooperation in cross company environments developed by the Plattform Industrie 4.0 can be applied to solve this challenge. Mimicking a real-world, multi-vendor, distributed environment, the demonstration integrates Hannover Messe demos from over 20 IIC member companies and Plattform Industrie 4.0 partner companies respectively into a single security demonstration. It spans multiple booths at Hannover Messe and remote sites around the world. The IIC and Plattform Industrie 4.0 have been collaborating for just over a year to combine the cross-domain approach of the IIC with Plattform Industrie 4.0’s focus on the manufacturing industry. The concept of this demonstration was launched only four short months ago. The demonstration highlights how multiple unique, existing security systems can be consolidated in a set of interacting industrial security systems, leveraging products and technologies available today that demonstrate secure integration of existing systems without disrupting operations. Security events are shared across the entire ecosystem, letting each member in the value chain see all security events that are relevant to them. “It’s really terrific to see so many global IIC members from multiple disciplines, working together with Plattform Industry 4.0 to achieve this industry first manufacturing-based real-time demo in a secure environment,” said John Tuccillo, Chair of the IIC Steering Committee, and Senior Vice President, Schneider Electric. “The joint demonstration is an important milestone in our cooperation. It shows that the exchange between the partners creates practical and transferable solutions. We are very thankful to our Joint Technology Group Security for this successful work,” said Henning Banthien, General Secretary of the Plattform Industrie 4.0. “Security is critical to industrial deployments and the Hannover Messe demonstration highlights the fact that deploying a robust industrial security monitoring solution in a heterogeneous environment across multiple companies and organizations can be achieved using today’s technology,” said Sven Schrecker, Co-Chair of the IIC Security Working Group and Chief Architect, IoT Security Solutions, Intel. “Our work result illustrates: secure data exchange across domains can be done. This means a central precondition for secure cross-company value networks is met,” adds Michael Jochem, Robert Bosch GmbH and Chair of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 Working Group Security of Networked Systems. Live Demonstration at the Hannover Messe The central presentation can be found in Stands C24 and D24 of Hall 8 of Hannover Messe and live demonstrations can be found in many participating member stands and halls throughout the event, in other parts of Germany and in other parts of the world. There will be a joint press conference on April 25, 2017 from 9 – 10 am CET at the Hannover Messe, Convention Center, Saal 15.

Retailers looking to maintain a competitive edge will need to invest in these three areas. IoT and the Connected Retail Environment Connecting appliances to the Internet has a strong appeal to consumers, and it comes down to consumer convenience. The ability to preheat an oven, start a dishwasher, or order groceries from a connected device simplifies the life of the consumer. The more that retailers can address consumer needs for simplifying tasks and saving time, the better positioned retailers will be in the crowded retail market. Another benefit that connected retailers are experiencing involves product  performance. Image recognition technology, as shared by both Intel and Trax, delivers insight to retailers from store shelves on how their products are performing. This allows sales associates to monitor and reduce out-of-stock occurrences, ultimately increasing revenue and improving customer experience. IoT is also improving the customer experience by helping retailers personalize shopping.. At NRF Ron Jon showcased its interactive Smart Digital Surfboard, which determines important customer information, including gender, age bracket, and dwell time, to help customize the shopping experience for each person.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170420006245/en/ With the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industrie 4.0, manufacturers are adding more connected devices, sharing operational data with IT systems within both their own factories and businesses, as well as extending information exchange across their entire value chain. This increased digitization offers a host of benefits to manufacturers, their partners, suppliers and customers. In a connected world, this robust connectivity amplifies the importance of security both within a single manufacturer’s plant and across every participant in the value chain. There is no single, homogeneous security environment; rather there are multiple companies and systems that need to work together. The joint real-time demonstration at Hannover Messe shows how the IIC’s recently released Industrial Internet Security Framework and the concepts of secure cooperation in cross company environments developed by the Plattform Industrie 4.0 can be applied to solve this challenge. Mimicking a real-world, multi-vendor, distributed environment, the demonstration integrates Hannover Messe demos from over 20 IIC member companies and Plattform Industrie 4.0 partner companies respectively into a single security demonstration. It spans multiple booths at Hannover Messe and remote sites around the world. The IIC and Plattform Industrie 4.0 have been collaborating for just over a year to combine the cross-domain approach of the IIC with Plattform Industrie 4.0’s focus on the manufacturing industry. The concept of this demonstration was launched only four short months ago. The demonstration highlights how multiple unique, existing security systems can be consolidated in a set of interacting industrial security systems, leveraging products and technologies available today that demonstrate secure integration of existing systems without disrupting operations. Security events are shared across the entire ecosystem, letting each member in the value chain see all security events that are relevant to them. “It’s really terrific to see so many global IIC members from multiple disciplines, working together with Plattform Industry 4.0 to achieve this industry first manufacturing-based real-time demo in a secure environment,” said John Tuccillo, Chair of the IIC Steering Committee, and Senior Vice President, Schneider Electric. “The joint demonstration is an important milestone in our cooperation. It shows that the exchange between the partners creates practical and transferable solutions. We are very thankful to our Joint Technology Group Security for this successful work,” said Henning Banthien, General Secretary of the Plattform Industrie 4.0. “Security is critical to industrial deployments and the Hannover Messe demonstration highlights the fact that deploying a robust industrial security monitoring solution in a heterogeneous environment across multiple companies and organizations can be achieved using today’s technology,” said Sven Schrecker, Co-Chair of the IIC Security Working Group and Chief Architect, IoT Security Solutions, Intel. “Our work result illustrates: secure data exchange across domains can be done. This means a central precondition for secure cross-company value networks is met,” adds Michael Jochem, Robert Bosch GmbH and Chair of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 Working Group Security of Networked Systems. Live Demonstration at the Hannover Messe The central presentation can be found in Stands C24 and D24 of Hall 8 of Hannover Messe and live demonstrations can be found in many participating member stands and halls throughout the event, in other parts of Germany and in other parts of the world. There will be a joint press conference on April 25, 2017 from 9 – 10 am CET at the Hannover Messe, Convention Center, Saal 15. You can join the live telephone conference via this link where you can submit written questions.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) lead in acquiring smaller companies, but there are plenty of big players. Why the gold rush? According to a report out Wednesday morning from IDC, worldwide revenues for cognitive and AI systems will rise 59.3% this year to $12.5 billion and global spending on AI will explode at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54.4% through 2020 when revenues will top $46 billion. That’s enough to get anyone’s attention. Of this year’s total spending, some $4.5 billion is targeted at cognitive applications that automatically learn, discover and make recommendations or predictions. Cognitive applications are expected to see a CAGR of 69.6% over a five-year period. IDC research director David Schubmehl noted: Intelligent applications based on cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are the next wave of technology transforming how consumers and enterprises work, learn, and play. These applications are being developed and implemented on cognitive/AI software platforms that offer the tools and capabilities to provide predictions, recommendations, and intelligent assistance through the use of cognitive systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Cognitive/AI systems are quickly becoming a key part of IT infrastructure and all enterprises need to understand and plan for the adoption and use of these technologies in their organizations. In addition to Google, which paid $600 million for U.K.-based DeepMind Technologies in 2014 and has made 11 acquisitions since 2013, and Apple, which has made a total of 7 acquisitions of AI-related firms, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) have also made multiple acquisitions of AI technology firms. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) has made three acquisitions and has been pushing its Watson technology hard for some time now. Non-tech firms are also making acquisitions. Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) recently paid $1 billion for a one-third stake in Argo AI and General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) acquired Bit Stew and Wise.io last November. IDC research manager Marianne Daquila noted which sectors are most likely to spend the most on AI: Heavily regulated markets such as banking and securities investment services are among the early growth drivers. Collectively, these two financial industries will represent a quarter of worldwide spending on cognitive/AI solutions. Stringent compliance requirements are key drivers for these industries as they seek new innovations in fraud and risk detection. Additionally, companies in this sector are adopting cognitive-based program advisors and recommendations to better match products with clients. Elsewhere, manufacturing, retail, and healthcare are also expected to see very strong spending growth over the forecast period. Of the projected $12.5 billion in 2017 spending, U.S. firms are expected to spend nearly $9.7 billion.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Driving the day: A busy morning at the FCC By Li Zhou 04/20/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Alex Byers, Ashley Gold, Margaret Harding McGill and Nancy Scola DRIVING THE DAY: A BUSY MORNING AT THE FCC — FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is facing arguably the biggest day yet of his tenure atop the agency, with seven items up for a vote at today’s open meeting. Two of those items — a report and order on business broadband and a plan that relaxes how media ownership levels are calculated — have garnered significant attention from Capitol Hill, making this morning’s activity more politically charged than other agency work this year. Story Continued Below — WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: Pai’s business broadband order argues that there is strong competition in the so-called business data services marketplace — essentially the opposite stance of the Tom Wheeler-era FCC — and makes some changes to the way the agency regulates those products. Democrats like Mike Doyle and Ed Markey have asked Pai to postpone the vote, as has the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy. On the media ownership front, Pai is proposing to reinstate the so-called UHF discount, which would make it easier for some TV station owners to declare a smaller reach when complying with the 39 percent national audience cap. The move could essentially give broadcasters more flexibility to buy other TV stations — and was excoriated by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone in a letter Wednesday. ALSO ON THE DOCKET: Commissioners will also vote on proposals related to the Connect America Fund and wireless infrastructure. Stay tuned after the meeting, as Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn plans to debut her own post-meeting press conference, her office tells MT. FIVE THINGS TO WATCH ON OSTP’S STATE OF PLAY — Nancy has the latest on the positions that have been filled at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the ones that remain empty under the Trump administration’s watch. POLITICO filed a Freedom of Information Act request on April 7 for the current list of OSTP staff. Here's the document and some quick takeaways. Read more here. 1) The office is still powered by Obama-era aides, with just a single Trump hire. Of the nearly four dozen people listed in the FOIA document, only one was hired during the Trump administration: Michael Kratsios, a former chief of staff at the venture capital fund run by Trump adviser Peter Thiel. 2) The U.S. CTO's office has nearly emptied. No CTO has been named, and the administration hasn't said definitively one way or the other if it will have one. 3) The overall size of the office is about a third of what it was under Obama. Predictably given Obama's stated interest in science and tech (remember that he created the White House science fair), OSTP during his time in office grew a great deal, to about 115 staffers. 4) The drops in staffing levels vary across divisions. While on one end there's the nearly vacant CTO's office, on the other end (unsurprisingly, given the nature of its work) is the still functioning budget and administration wing: Of the eight people that worked there at the end of Obama’s tenure, all but one remain. 5) Some jobs responsible for high-stakes policy-making remain open. The job of OSTP director — filled for the length of Obama's time in office by John Holdren (who holds a Ph.D. from Stanford in aerospace engineering and theoretical plasma physics) — is still unfilled.

POLITICO Event — Rebuilding America: A New Infrastructure Agenda — Join POLITICO for a discussion on the prospects for a major national infrastructure push from the new administration and Congress. Speakers include: Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Building America’s Future President Marcia Hale, Club for Growth President David McIntosh, and Chamber of Commerce ED Transportation Infrastructure Ed Mortimer. Monday, April 24 — 5:30pm — The Newseum. RSVP: here. BIG PUSH ON COPYRIGHT BILL — More than 50 groups and companies including the Copyright Alliance, Oracle and the Motion Picture Association of America are pressing the House to schedule a vote on proposed legislation (H.R. 1695) that would make the register of copyrights a president-appointed, Senate-confirmed position. “This bill is not about any one President, any one Librarian, or any one Register. It is the product of four years of bipartisan, bicameral discussion,” the organizations write in a letter today. “A few who are interested in weakening copyright policy are trying to polarize debate with partisanship, personal aspersions, and ad hominem attacks.” The measure passed out of the House Judiciary Committee in a 27-1 vote, but it’s been criticized by Democrats like Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who note that it would deprive Carla Hayden, the first African-American woman Librarian of Congress, of the power to appoint the register. ** A message from Samsung: Smart technologies will enable the vehicle of tomorrow.

Samsung.com/VisionForTomorrow ** DELRAHIM GETS HIS DAY IN CONGRESS — The Senate Judiciary Committee will review Makan Delrahim’s nomination to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division next Wednesday, April 26. Delrahim has said he doesn’t see the AT&T-Time Warner merger — which would be under his purview if confirmed — posing an antitrust problem. GOP LAWMAKERS FUNDRAISING IN VALLEY THIS WEEK — Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is leading a trip out west with several other Republican leaders, which will include a fundraising event at the home of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison today, Recode reports. Other techies who are expected to make an appearance at the gathering include Oracle CEO and Trump advisor Safra Catz, former Apple CEO Mike Markkula, and former general counsel of Facebook Ted Ullyot. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) are also reportedly taking a jaunt to the Bay Area as well. SILICON VALLEY MUST-READS — — Google, Facebook, Uber oppose second travel ban: More than 150 tech companies filed an amicus brief Wednesday asking a federal court to toss out the Trump administration's second attempt at a ban restricting travel to the U.S. by people from certain countries, Ashley reports. The brief, filed in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, was signed by 162 companies including Google, Yelp, PayPal, Amazon, Netflix, Adobe, Airbnb, Facebook, Intel, Lyft, SpaceX, Tesla, Uber and Yahoo. — Wanted: 10,000 volunteers for Alphabet health study: The company is gathering data for a four-year health study investigating how healthy people get sick, CNBC reports. Alphabet’s life sciences branch, Verily, is collaborating with Duke University and Stanford Medicine to conduct the research, which will require participants to wear health trackers and get their genomes sequenced. — Think typing thoughts: First, Elon Musk proposed the creation of technology that could merge people’s brains with artificial intelligence. Now, Facebook has shared its own plans for a brain-to-computer technology that would enable people to type using their thoughts, The Verge reports. WHAT’S IN PAI’S POCKET — FCC Chairman Ajti Pai’s public financial disclosure report shows a fiscally responsible diversified mutual fund portfolio, a college savings plan for his kids and retirement accounts. He also has some income coming in through a rental property in Kansas City, Mo. He doesn’t report holding any individual stocks. As a political appointee, Pai has to report the information to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, though he doesn’t have to report his salary or the value of the home he lives in. All told, his assets could be worth up to nearly $2.2 million, but keep in mind the values are reported via large ranges. RICKETTS BOWS OUT — Donald Trump's choice for deputy commerce secretary, Todd Ricketts, has withdrawn from consideration, a source close to Ricketts said today, POLITICO reports. The decision by Ricketts, a Chicago Cubs co-owner and TD Ameritrade board member, to withdraw his name was due to difficulties untangling his financial holdings to satisfy ethics rules, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, which first reported the news. LIBRARIANS LOVE BROADBAND — The American Library Association recently hired J.A.Hill to work on broadband infrastructure and other issues, according to a new filing. It’s another sign of the broad interest generated by the idea of including a broadband buildout in a national infrastructure plan. “ALA agrees with the many congressional leaders who’ve said that every American needs high-speed broadband and that it must be part of the coming infrastructure bill,” the group tells MT. “ALA hired an expert because, especially in tight times, leveraging America’s 120,000 libraries to get broadband to almost every community is the best first investment toward that goal Congress can make." ICYMI: TECH GAVE BIG TO TRUMP INAUGURATION — Tech and telecom giants that have pending policy issues in Washington were large contributors to the Trump inaugural committee, POLITICO’s Darren Samuelsohn and Madeline Conway report: “AT&T, the largest single corporate donor for January’s official government handover, gave $2.1 million as it awaits federal approval of its merger with Time Warner” and “Qualcomm donated $1 million while it continues to fight an Obama-era Federal Trade Commission anti-competitiveness complaint.” A rundown of some other tech and telecom contributions: Microsoft and Intel gave $500,000 each while Google gave $285,000. Comcast and Charter Communications gave $250,000 each while Verizon and Samsung gave $100,000 apiece. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who played a role in the Trump transition, gave $100,000 as well. ON THE ‘CASE’ AT THE SMITHSONIAN— President Trump on Wednesday signed a resolution that reappoints AOL co-founder Steve Case as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian. Case was first nominated for the position in 2011.

The company it has no problem changing things up in an effort to keep its premium ultraportable hip and trendy. Having already gone through a few mild wardrobe changes over the past few years, the newest iteration of the Spectre x360 brings another slightly different look than last year's model -- one that is perhaps more refined and mature. It retains the gold accents introduced by its predecessor, but does not flaunt them quite as loudly. Other upgrades are not as subtle. HP continues to offer the Spectre x360 in 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch form factors, the latter of which we're reviewing here, but what's new here is a 4K Ultra HD display option available on the larger model. This is powered by another new addition, a discrete NVIDIA GeForce 940MX GPU that is also exclusive to the 15.6-inch model. HP seems to have taken a page out of Apple's playbook by limiting certain amenities to the bigger (and pricier) SKU, though an argument could be made that a 4K display is more befitting of a 15.6-inch panel. Why not roll with a modern generation GPU based on NVIDIA's Pascal architecture? We suspect it has to do with the value proposition. This particular configuration, which you can purchase at Best Buy or customize on HP's website, runs about $1,500. That's premium territory, but it's also several hundred dollars less than what some similarly configured laptops toting GeForce 10 series GPUs go for. While the on-board graphics are from last generation, the CPU inside is based on Intel's latest 7th generation Core architecture (Kaby Lake). More specifically, it wields a Core i7-7500U processor running at 2.7GHz (base) to 3.5GHz (Turbo). This is a dual-core chip with Hyper Threading support, 4MB of cache, and a low 15W TDP. It strikes a nice balance between power and price, with the ability to ramp up to 3.5GHz when demanding tasks call for processing muscle. Having a discrete GPU paired with a Kaby Lake processor gives the Spectre x360 15 the versatility to tackle a wide range of chores, but it does not end there. Underneath those good looks is a functional 2-in-1 design that allows this laptop to transform into a Windows 10 tablet. It even comes with an HP Active Stylus. We will cover these traits in more detail on the following pages along with performance metrics from our gauntlet of benchmarks. Before we do that though, let's have a look at the specs... HP Spectre x360 15 (2017) Specifications & Features Processor Options 7th Gen Intel Core i7-7500U (4MB Cache, 2.7Ghz to 3.5GHz) Display 15.6-inch diagonal 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160) UWVA eDP BrightView WLED-backlit w/ touch support Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 940MX w/ 2GB GDDR5 Memory 16GB DDR4 2133MHz (2x8GB) Storage 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 Solid State Drive Optical N/A Ethernet N/A WiFi Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC + Bluetooth 4.2 Interface (Left) USB 3.1 Gen1 (Type-A), Headphone/Microphone, Power Button, SD Card Reader Interface (Right) Thunderbolt 3 (Data up to 40GB/s, Power Deliver, DisplayPort 1.2, HP Sleep and Charge), USB 3.1 Gen1 (Type-C), HDMI, Volume Rocker Interface (Top) N/A Webcam HP Wide Vision Full HD IR Camera with Dual array digital microphone Operating System Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Battery 6-cell Lithium Ion (79.2 WHr) Dimensions Height: 0.7” / Width: 14” / Depth: 9.88” Weight 4.42 pounds Warranty 1 Year limited hardware warranty, 90 day phone support Pricing $1,499.99 as configured The SKU that HP sent us is available at Best Buy, though you can hop on HP's website and configure the same setup for the same price. Either way, there's a fair amount of high-end hardware here for the price, including a fast 512GB NVMe M.2 SSD and 16GB of DDR4-2133 RAM. It's nice to see that HP isn't skimping on storage or RAM capacity. It's also worth noting that since this setup comes with a discrete GPU, none of the system memory has to be allocated to graphics. In addition the stylus that comes with the system, HP also includes a sleeve. What's not included, however, are any adapters. HP offers several on its website, including a USB Type-C to RJ45 (Ethernet) adapter for $50, if you think you'll need it.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home First impressions PC Dawn of War 3 is brutal, beautiful, and inconsistently brilliant Hammer time. By Chris Tapsell Published 20/04/2017 Editor's note: this is an early verdict on Dawn of War 3 based on a full campaign playthrough and a couple of hours in multiplayer. Watch out for our final thoughts after release, once we've had a chance to see how the online holds up in the wilds. Twelve missions deep into Dawn of War 3's campaign, I'm getting a little tense. It's been an enjoyable, if predictable ride so far; the story's a schlocky, quintessentially 40k epic of stoicism, but all pretty steady-as-she-goes as far as mission design. Now, though, things are hotting up. I've breezed through the previous mashups of survive-kill-repeat, but this battle's not going quite so smoothly. No sooner had I guided Gabriel Angelos to the rescue of his scattered, ever-vigilant brothers than they died, bellows of "servitude!" and "xenos!" and "honor!" making little difference to what must have been hundreds of onrushing Orks. After taking out a giant Ork tractor beam, the purpose of which I can't reveal (or really understand, but then, that's the fun of the Orks), all I have to do is hold out until extraction. Typical RTS stuff. But at this point I have just one Dreadnought left, a few Devastator Marines, my elites - Angelos, alongside his friends the Librarian Jonah Orion and Chaplain Diomedes - and, well that's about it. The Dreadnought finishes dismantling the tractor beam, but then down goes Angelos - I'd left him a little overexposed, having gone after a backline of Shoota Boys - and now I'm in real trouble. Swarms of Ork cannon fodder plow into the heavy cover my Devastators were using and with that, the cathartic churn of bolter-fire winds down. I lay out a quick combo from the Librarian, squelching a good three squads of greenskins with a shock of lightning and sealing several others within a temporary walled arena for the Dreadnought to do the rest. But Diomedes is caught outside the wall - I had no choice! - and a few valiant thunks of the hammer later, down he goes. The Librarian follows, and now it's just the trusty Dreadnought. He's served me well, that Dreadnought. I almost want to wipe away a tear as he turns another four xenos to red mush with a resplendent Slam, slugging away in the face of the inevitable. It's another twenty seconds until Angelos can redeploy, and our enemies are all around us. Sure enough the Dreadnought implodes, and that's Mission Failed. A good forty-five minutes down the drain at this point - there are no checkpoints, astonishingly, even in missions much longer than this. But then, that's three quarters of an hour I'd gladly relive. Gorgutz's Orks are a shining beacon of comic relief in an otherwise moody campaign. This, for me, is Dawn of War 3 at its best, at least so far. I'm certain the people at Relic have their own ideas as to what DoW 3's high points are - the scale of the combat is probably the stand-out feature at a glance. But whilst I'll never really tire of seeing a towering Wraithknight powerslide on its knees through tiny squealing Orks - half rockstar, half drunk dad kicking over your LEGO - it's the little things that really grab me, the horribly difficult multitasking and micromanagement that is, of course, an essential part of any RTS. Down here in the genre's trenches, DoW3 separates itself from the pack. It's equal parts infuriating and enthralling, thanks to one of the most talked-about new modifications to the formula: an active ability system ripped from the strategy relative everyone loves to hate, the MOBA. On the surface, it's really just a few more active abilities for certain units, mapped to the QWER buttons in mimicry of how MOBA set up your abilities. It's a painfully simple change, but this may be one of the best evolutionary tweaks to real time strategy that we've seen in some time, because whilst micromanagement is already pretty much everything in real time strategy, here it's ramped up to even greater importance. Campaign missions - take my failed survival attempt as an example - often scatter the map with various optional sub-objectives, from rescuing isolated Marines to seeking out collectibles or adding new followers to your cause. They aren't handled in hugely inventive ways - it's normally a case of "go to the smaller objective marker on your map and kill something" - but having to split your troops between multiple fronts makes a considerable difference. Active abilities are also doled out more generously than you might have been led to believe, with near enough every unit in the game holding at least one. Whilst the Elites have been put front and centre in much of DoW3's messaging and, indeed, the story, they aren't much more important in-game than the toughest units from previous entries, save for the absolute top-tier, late-game walkers. Terminators are Terminators. It's just that for them to work as effectively as you'd expect, you might need to pay a little more active attention. One of many unlockable Doctrines, which look a little dull but bring huge influence to each game. More attention is required of you before you get into a game, too. Before each campaign mission and multiplayer game you'll need to select up to three Elite units, and three Doctrines - Dawn of War's take on the pre-match Intel Bulletins of Relic's own Company of Heroes 2, or dare I say it, League of Legends' Runes and Masteries. These are modifiers, unlocked by spending Skulls, an in-game currency awarded for completing campaign missions or online matches (Dawn of War's extensive army painter also returns, so you can tailor the look of your units). But where some versions of this concept don't make much impact - a half percent accuracy increase here or there - Doctrines grant opportunities for a noticeable shift in playstyle. You can apply a Doctrine that lets Orks heal by looting scrap, for example, or go with Listening Posts that reinforce your Space Marine troops on the front line. They can also unlock both passive and active abilities for some units that otherwise lack them. The variety there, particularly when coupled with choosing Elites - do I go early game rush with some quick-to-unlock assassins, or late game tech with a huge walker unit and some high-cost soldiers? - and on top of being restricted to three Doctrines at a time, represents another welcome layer of strategy and control. As I spend more time in the multiplayer in the coming days, I'm hoping the pre-game decision-making will give rise to a lively, evolving meta after launch. But there's also a handful of things I'd like to see improved on. The most prominent, albeit nebulous, of those is resource flow. Dawn of War 3 centres on the same two resources as the original, Requisition and Power, plus new Elite Points. Relic has toyed with that balance for some time now, not just within their 40k franchise, so it's disappointing to find things a little out of tune here. I've often found myself with huge sums of spare Requisition and not a shred of Power, despite upgrading my captured points wherever possible. Popular now G2A rep roasted by developers during live Q&A UPDATE: G2A hits back. 116 Sources: Nintendo to launch SNES mini this year Major factor for NES mini discontinuation. 215 Ghost Recon: Wildlands bests Zelda in US sales for March Mass Effect: Andromeda sales are the second-best in the series. 24 More time is needed to play around with builds and opposition in multiplayer before really addressing that side of things, of course, but then, I'm largely drawing from my experiences in single-player. Resource points have different kinds of output - some you can build two Power generators on, for example, others none at all - and these aren't always logically distributed in campaign missions, which don't always give you a base at all. I'm sure there's a reason for it, but I just cannot fathom why I'd be handed a fully-functioning base in a mission, only to have my ability to produce units from it totally kneecapped. I've ventured into online a couple of times. It's as flashy as it looks, but more on this to come. There are, likewise, a couple of things that Relic seem to have glossed over as regards their forays into neighbouring genres. For one, there's a curious sluggishness in response to your inputs in DoW3, with units often waiting half a second before moving or changing course. Bearing in mind Relic's justification for removing the fan-loved death animations of the original DoW - a necessity, the developer has said, to ensure absolute control in competitive matches - having such painfully slow responses in a world where eSports players move from one coast of America to the other in search of 8 millisecond ping is a real blemish. I have other, minor gripes - years of League of Legends have made me alarmingly snobbish about tooltip clarity, for one thing ("Land Speeders fight harder when they are behind enemy lines" could mean anything!) - but I'll be reserving judgment on these and more important issues like the AI, balancing and the general flow of online matches until our full review. For now though, there are signs of serious promise. Bringing it back to that button-mapping for just another second, this feels like the RTS equivalent of the moment everyone sat down and decided that controllers have two analog sticks and the jump button goes where PlayStation put the X. What's more, DoW3 has more going on than both previous games combined when it comes to scale, tone and the straight-up phwoarr-factor of battle. Whether or not those brilliant highs are undermined by a couple of clumsily missed marks will become clear enough soon.

Jumia Travel , the leading online travel agency, shares 6 of these broad guidelines to help you out. The Screen When buying a laptop, be sure to go for the laptop that gives you the best screen within your price range. A good screen typically considers three things: resolution, viewing angles and size. Laptops with higher resolution screens are generally the best ones to choose. For portability, smaller screens are better, but if you intend to use the laptop for entertainment and architectural or artistic functions, then a bigger screen is best. Lastly, in terms of viewing angles, a laptop screen that touts IPS (in-plane switching) technology offers the widest viewing angles for the best user comfort. Screen Quality You should consider laptops that are comfortable to look at because you are likely to be looking at it for quite some time during the day. Many laptops these days have touchscreens, but these touch screens tend to be glossy and glossy screens leads to reflections that negatively affect your eyes. You should therefore try to avoid these glossy screens and maybe opt for laptops that aren’t touchscreen, but if you must buy one go for the ones that don’t have glossy screens. RAM Typically, more RAM is better. For a decent laptop experience, 4GB RAM can be considered, but 8GB RAM is recommended. If you intend to do a lot of video and photo editing, you can consider buying one with 16GB RAM. More RAM allows for more applications to run at the same time, and for more data to be quickly accessible to the system at any one time. When buying a laptop, it’s always best to consider the ones with more RAM compared to others, within your favored price range. Keyboard Quality It’s advisable to choose a laptop with a keyboard that’s comfortable for you, rather than one that packs in every key and forces you to start hunting for keys. You should go for a keyboard with a comfortable layout with full sized keys and some space around the arrow keys. The keys should have a sort of ‘snappy responsiveness’ and should be easy on your fingers. When buying a laptop, it’s best to get a feel of the keyboard rather than ‘buying blind’ (asking someone to buy it for you or ordering online). CPU Intel’s Core-Based CPUs are one of the best to consider when buying a laptop. Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 offer some of the best performance when it comes to multitasking and multimedia tasks. However, for Core i7-based systems, though they offer the best performance for your laptop, the heat emitted from the base of the laptop tends to be a cause for concern if you plan to use the laptop for a long time. Battery Life Pay attention to the rating of the battery in Watt-hours (Wh) or milliamp-hours (mAh); typically the larger the figures, the longer the battery can last.

No Firefox 53 for you The latest Firefox release promises fewer crashes thanks to its new Quantum Compositor, and drops support for some antique operating systems. By Steve Ranger | April 20, 2017 -- 12:47 GMT (05:47 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software Image: Mozilla The latest version of the Firefox browser shows off Mozilla's new process for graphics compositing, but also drops support for ageing operating systems such as Windows XP and Windows Vista. Firefox 53 includes one of the first elements of Mozilla's Project Quantum, which aims to take advantage of multi-core hardware and the wide availability of devices incorporating GPUs. The new Quantum Compositor promises to speed up Firefox and prevent graphics crashes on Windows by running the graphics compositor separate to the main Firefox process. Special Feature Cloud - How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. Read More The Quantum Compositor runs on the GPU instead of the CPU, which means it should go faster. And if the graphics compositor crashes, it won't bring down all of Firefox because it's a separate process. In testing, the Quantum Compositor reduced browser crashes by about 10 percent. Mozilla said Quantum Compositor will be available for about 70 percent of Firefox users -- those running Windows 10, 8, and 7 with the Platform Update, on computers with graphics cards from Intel, Nvidia, or AMD. Firefox 53 for the desktop also has two new themes: Compact Light and Compact Dark, and a redesigned interface for granting and managing website permissions. When a website wants to access sensitive hardware or send you a notification, you'll be prompted with a dialog box that explicitly highlights the permissions that site is requesting. Mozilla said Firefox 53 won't support Windows XP and Vista, although XP and Vista users running Firefox 52 will continue to receive security updates on Firefox ESR 52 -- the extended support release. Neither XP nor, more recently, Vista are supported by Microsoft, although XP at least still has a surprisingly large following. Apple's 32-bit Mac OS X is no longer supported either: Mozilla said that 32-bit Mac OS X users can switch to Firefox ESR 52 to continue receiving security updates. Mozilla has also ended Firefox Linux support for processors older than Pentium 4 and AMD Opteron. Read more about Firefox What's the fastest Linux web browser?

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Windows 10 to get power throttling feature for improved battery life Microsoft is working to combat a major issue laptops face – draining battery life due to multiple apps running in the background. The company is testing a new feature for Windows 10 preview build (16176) dubbed as power throttling aimed at saving battery usage. Microsoft says Power Throttling showed up to 11% savings in CPU power consumption for some of the most strenuous use cases. It will allocate just enough processing power to background processes to keep them running while keeping power consumption to a minimum. Power Throttling is currently available only for processors with Intel’s Speed Shift technology, available in Intel’s 6th-gen (and beyond) Core processors. Microsoft said it is working on expanding support to other processors as well over the next few months. You can control power throttling with Power Slider that can be found by clicking the battery icon on the taskbar. Moreover, you can also manually opt-out specific apps from power-throttling by going to Battery Settings in Settings > System > Battery > Battery Usage by App. Microsoft wrote in a blog post, In this latest Insider Preview build (Build 16176), we leveraged modern silicon capabilities to run background work in a power-efficient manner, thereby enhancing battery life significantly while still giving users access to powerful multitasking capabilities of Windows. With “Power Throttling”, when background work is running, Windows places the CPU in its most energy efficient operating modes – work gets done, but the minimal possible battery is spent on that work.

(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Bank of Israel Karnit Flug Moshe Kahlon Related Stories Israelis hold mass protest pot smoke outside Knesset Facebook wants to read your mind No entry to viruses, thanks to Israeli-US team’s wastewater filter Israeli startup says if the shoe fits, consumers will buy more Nanosatellite built by Israeli high-schoolers blasts into space United Nations looks to Israel in drive to recruit more doctors Synagogues get Shabbat emergency app for phoneless worshipers MeMed gets $9.2 million contract from US DoD arm The Bank of Israel on Thursday backed a package of tax breaks and benefits Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon announced earlier this week, saying the measures were “appropriate,” addressed structural problems and were in line with the policies of the central bank and the government. “Most of them integrate well into the government’s strategy to encourage employment, reduce poverty among working people, and assist young working families, and they are in line with the Bank of Israel’s policy recommendations,” the central bank said in a statement. “As they are measures that respond to structural problems, and are not coming to serve a transitory need to stimulate economic activity that is robust in any case, it is important that the measures be permanent.” The governor of the Bank of Israel Karnit Flug has recently voiced criticism of the government for promising to use surplus tax revenues to cut taxes for citizens instead of investing the sums in improving education and infrastructure. The package of tax breaks and benefits announced by Kahlon on Tuesday is aimed at increasing the net income of poor and middle-class working families by thousands of shekels a year. The NIS 4 billion a year ($1.1 billion) plan includes subsidies for after-school education, additional tax credits for working parents of children up to age 6, higher income supplements for low-income earners, equalization of tax credits for working fathers and mothers, and tax cuts on children’s clothes, shoes and cellphones. Netanyahu did not offer immediate endorsement But while the plan has won widespread praise, Netanyahu did not offer any immediate endorsement. On Tuesday evening, sources close to the prime minister said that the initiative “was in the right direction and will be approached positively,” but he gave no direct praise. Though the proposal would constitute the government’s largest welfare package to date, the prime minister had not been briefed ahead of time nor invited to the press conference where Kahlon presented the plan. Kahlon on Tuesday said the treasury had amassed a surplus of NIS 1.6 billion ($436 million) during the first quarter of 2017 and that forecasts were for an extra NIS 3 billion ($817 million) in government income for 2017 and NIS 3.5 billion ($953 million) more in 2018. The figures did not include the expected windfall in taxes following Intel’s decision in March to buy the Israeli car technology company Mobileye for an unprecedented $15.3 billion. On Thursday, the Bank of Israel said it was still difficult to assess the cost of Kahlon’s announced measures, as some of them were not completely detailed and had different start dates, lengths, and approval processes. “Given these limitations, the cost assessments published by the Finance Ministry are in line with the assessments of the Bank of Israel. The plan utilizes a significant portion of the reserve for special needs set aside in the 2018 budget within the framework of the two-year budget.” Assuming the measures will be permanent, as is desirable, additional funding sources for the plan will need to be found to ensure the government’s ability to meet its fiscal targets for 2019-20, the statement said. The central bank said that even in light of the proposed steps, it was important that government implement added policies that will lead to “improving the economy’s human and physical capital infrastructures, thus increasing the economy’s long-term growth potential.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Bank of Israel,  Karnit Flug,  Moshe Kahlon,  taxes,  Benjamin Netanyahu,  education More in Israel Inside Liberman hails ruling allowing Tel Aviv shops to open on Shabbat Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Israeli startup says if the shoe fits, consumers will buy more By Shoshanna Solomon   No entry to viruses, thanks to Israeli-US team’s wastewater filter By Shoshanna Solomon   Facebook wants to read your mind By Glenn Chapman   MeMed gets $9.2 million contract from US DoD arm By Shoshanna Solomon   Synagogues get Shabbat emergency app for phoneless worshipers By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs April 19, 2017, 9:41 pm OECD Exec: Israel Among Top Countries for High Risk Real Estate Prices OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) Exec Peter Jarrett says Israel is among the top five......

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Despite legal battle with Apple, Qualcomm collected some iPhone royalties Aaron Pressman, Fortune April 20, 2017 3:51 AM Above: Qualcomm logo. Image Credit: Reuters / Mike Blake Qualcomm continued to collect some royalties for Apple’s use of its wireless technology in iPhones last year despite dueling lawsuits between the two mobile giants, cheering Qualcomm investors who feared that the payments had entirely dried up. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that Apple’s contract manufacturers including Foxconn paid royalties, although they withheld around $1 billion from the undisclosed total amount due. The amount withheld equaled the amount Qualcomm withheld from Apple last year under a separate agreement to cooperate on mobile technology that has since expired. Shares of Qualcomm, which have lost 19% so far this year, were up 2% in after hours trading based on news of the royalty payments and quarterly results which were somewhat better than Wall Street analysts expected. Qualcomm said it was unsure whether Apple’s manufacturers would withhold any royalties owed during the current quarter. Apple declined to comment. The partial royalty payments and future uncertainty come as a legal disputes over intellectual property rights in the mobile market have reignited after a few years of quiet. Apple, which sued makers of Android phones for patent infringement six years ago, filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in January that claimed the mobile chip designer charged excessive royalties to use its technology and alleged that Qualcomm owed Apple $1 billion in rebates. Last week, Qualcomm counter-sued, saying Apple had violated agreements between the two companies. “We have successfully navigated challenges like this in the past and we have confidence in the sustainability of our licensing business,” Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. “But we know these periods can generate added volatility in near term results and require open and regular dialogue with our investors.” Apple’s lawsuit, and other regulatory probes worldwide, have spooked investors by challenging the heart of Qualcomm’s royalty business model. The mobile chip maker charges phone makers a percentage of the price of every phone, regardless of whether the device includes chips actually sold by Qualcomm or a competitor like Intel. Qualcomm’s royalty business brings in the lion’s share of its pre-tax profits, or 80% in the most recent quarter–despite accounting for only about half the revenue brought in by its chip sales. Disclosure of the withheld royalty payments came as Qualcomm reported results for the first quarter of 2017, its fiscal second quarter. Adjusted revenue of $6 billion was up 8% from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share rose 29% to $1.34 and beat Wall Street analyst expectations of $1.19 per share. Analysts said Apple and its manufacturers likely would continue to pay at least a portion of what they owe in the future. “The $1 billion cooperation agreement ended at the end of 2016, so Qualcomm is preparing for smaller payments in the next quarter, not zero payments as that would be unprecedented,” says Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy.
