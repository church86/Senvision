CHENNAI: With Donald Trump withdrawing the world’s highest carbon-gas-emitting country from the Paris climate agreement, and French President Macron’s plea to “Make our planet great again”, the world is confounded by the present state of affairs. Flash floods, unbearable droughts, melting ice caps and starving polar bears — the complications are so large-scale that one cannot fathom the unbearable consequences of climate change. True, climate change existed even prior to the arrival of human beings but we sure have accelerated the rate immensely. This World Environment day, we tell you some easy and effective things you can do that can make a difference in the long run. The plastic menace We said we won’t preach, but this one is so simple yet so important that we felt it needs to be on the list. Did you know that one small plastic bag you bought at the corner Annachi kadai for the small packets of biscuit you eat in 10 minutes take thousands of years to decompose? And they don’t entirely disappear either. So carry along your tiny backpack or purse instead; it’s more fashionable than that white cover anyway! Pixels, the new paper The internet has made the world paper-free. Bank payments, electricity bills, and even magazines and other print media are now becoming digital. Statistically, if 20% of households in the world switched to online payment methods, an estimated 180 lakh trees equalling 4.5 crore kg of paper would be saved. Likewise, opt for less paper in other aspects of life too — like reading newspapers and books! If you’re the kind who loves to ‘feel the paper’ while reading, try to at least recycle the papers and donate/borrow old books. Go black to go green! Google is the wise old man (or woman) we go to when we want our hearts healed or to learn the best way to peel potatoes. But did you know that an all-white web page (like Google) uses about 74 watts to display, whereas a black page uses only 59 watts? This theory, proposed on an online blog, prompted Heap Media, an Australian internet company, to launch a ‘Black Google’ — Blackle, which saves energy as the screen is predominantly black. Blackle believes that ‘even if the energy savings are small, they all add up’, thus making a significant change over the years. Till date, the Blackle search engine claims to have saved 62.49  lakh watts, as per the running counter on the screen. Movie time A typical movie download is around 700 MB, and if you download higher quality content, it’s double the file size. Watching movies online and downloading them from servers create traffic jam, causing it to consume more power. Therefore, watching movies the traditional way on the big screen while munching popcorn is the best way; both from a legal and an eco-friendly perspective. If you still feel the need to download movies, make sure to opt for a P2P file transfer method. Letting go, the eco way Traditional Indian funerals involve a 5-6 hour cremation process, which involves over 600kg of wood and the release of a significant amount of carbon dioxide.  According to Mokshda, a Delhi-based NGO working to reduce the environmental impact of funeral pyres, over 6 crore trees are burned during cremations in a year. Electric crematoriums, energy-saving cremation systems and opting for a burial instead, significantly reduce the negative impact of traditional cremations. No meat We know it’s really hard to give up on meat, but did you know that a vegetarian diet generates only half the carbon dioxide compared to a diet which consists of 30% meat, dairy and poultry? The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) suggests that the livestock sector is responsible for 18% of the global greenhouse gas emissions as compared to the transport sectors’ 15%. If going meat-free is too big a step, cutting down to one meat portion every other day would help too. Still not convinced? How about replacing meat with insects? According to FAO, over 1400 insect species are edible and require significantly less energy to produce. Go together, or go home Over 30 Indian cities figure in the Top 100 Most Polluted Global Cities as per data published by World Health Organization in 2016, and much of this pollution comes from vehicular emissions. And what’s more, a report reveals that number of vehicles will go up from 2.9 crore in 2015 to more than 4.8 crore by 2020. Abandon the need to impress your neighbours with a new car and think of better ways to commute to work — it shouldn’t be too hard considering the newly opened Chennai Metro, MRTS, suburban and MTC buses connecting most parts of the city. If you still must go by car, consider carpooling... you might make some new friends in the process, believe us! Pull the plug On an average, we spend about 8-9 hours a day in front of a computer or using the phone, which are almost always on charge. Ever noticed the charger heating up even when not connected to your device? Even when plugged-in appliances are turned off, they’re still using energy. Take off the plug when your devices are not in use, even if it means you need to stretch your arms a little. Better yet, switch off the device entirely and read a book for a change; it not only saves electricity but also stimulates brain power, apparently the scarcest human resource. Don’t wash your jeans! A few years ago, Levi Strauss Co.’s VP of sustainability, Michael Kobori and his team conducted a life cycle assessment of a pair of jeans to understand its carbon footprint. It was found that an average pair of jeans, after two years of use, washed weekly once, consumes roughly 3,500 litres of water! So, don’t wash your jeans often! Also would be great if you could opt for eco-denims which use organic cotton and natural dyes.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Patent Reveals Next-Gen Gear VR Headset with Multiple new Features, Major Accessories & Applications | Main June 04, 2017 While the State of VR Headsets is at a crawl today, the Market is set to Explode with Vitality later this Year   On Monday morning Apple is likely to show off their new Siri home device during their WWDC keynote. Amazon and Google got the leap on Apple and tomorrow we're likely to see Apple's version revealed. Another device segment that Apple is behind in at the moment, at least on paper, is VR headsets. Worldwide shipments of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) headsets for Q1 2017 were dominated by Sony, Samsung, HTC, Facebook and TCL.  With Apple absent, are they in danger of losing this race? Of course not.      At present the volume of such devices is anemic and that's being polite. For all of Q1, the total units sold worldwide was 2.280 million. It's like another Apple TV hobby market. Not that it'll stay at those levels for long, but for now, Apple has time to set their headset roadmap right before launching such a device.   Apple keeps adding top level talent like Jeff Noris that lead the Mission Operations team at NASA that worked with various VR headsets. Other top level hires have been working on this project for some time now (one and two). Of course Apple could always join the me-too crowd by introducing a dumb screenless viewer iPhone accessory, but it would seem by the talent that they're bringing onboard this project, that Apple has their eye on the prize at the higher end of the market as any Apple shareholder would expect from Apple. There's no money in cheap screenless viewer devices.    The VR Market is set to Explode in Q4   With a long list of new products scheduled to ship in the second half of 2017, IDC is forecasting triple-digit growth for the full year.   Patently Mobile posted a detailed patent report earlier today regarding a Samsung patent application published by the U.S. Patent Office this week that shows us some of the newest ideas that Samsung is contemplating for a future headset. You could check out our full patent report here. The report also points to new headsets coming by HTC and Lenovo that will support a new technology called 'WorldSense.' The technology covers motion controlling game play and beyond.   In addition, we learned at Computex 2017, Microsoft announced that HP, Dell, Asus and Acer will be supporting Microsoft's Mixed Reality headset platform for Christmas and Microsoft introduced new headset hand controllers at that show. So as IDC reports, there's a long list of new VR headsets coming to market by year's end.   IDC's report further noted that "VR represented the vast majority (more than 98%) of headsets shipped during the first quarter. Within VR, about two-thirds of all headset shipments were screenless viewers, such as Samsung's Gear VR and Google's Daydream View.   Meanwhile, tethered VR headsets, such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Sony's PSVR, accounted for one third of the market."   "The VR market is still very young and consumers seem to be taking a cautious approach," said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC's Mobile Device Trackers. "With plenty of headset options already in the market and even more coming soon, hardware isn't the issue. The bigger challenge is the slow growth in content that appeals to a mass audience, combined with the confusion associated with a lack of cross-platform support."   AR headsets saw year-over-year shipment growth of 77.4% as new products began shipping and existing headsets expanded distribution to additional countries. "It's very early days in terms of augmented reality headsets, with the vast majority of products shipping into the market focused on getting hardware into the hands of developers," said Tom Mainelli, vice president of Devices and AR/VR at IDC.   AR may Launch on Android and iPhone in Q4   Mainelli added in the report that "Meanwhile, we expect most consumers to experience their first taste of augmented reality through the cameras and screens of their existing mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets."   It's been rumored that Apple may introduce some form of Augmented Reality with their iPhone 8 or iPhone X. Whether it'll be a feature akin to Google's upcoming Google lens is unknown at this time. However, I think that it's highly likely that it could be as a follow-up to Apple's dual lens feature on the iPhone 7 Plus called portrait.   It's in the camera UI where Apple could add an AR button for photography that will not only take the photo but also add the names of buildings on a photo when on holidays or add information about a piece of art when visiting a museum.   This is where Apple could slowly introduce Augmented Reality into the mainstream before leaping to a full blown headset. Apple was recently granted a patent on this feature and Apple's acquisition of Metaio puts them in a great position to deliver top quality AR experiences on future iDevices.    IDC's Q1 2017 VR Headset Statistical Chart   While Samsung shot for cheap volume shipments of screenless viewers to look like the market's leader, it's once again smoke and mirrors. Sony which is shown to be solidly in second position actually sells their headsets whereas Samsung had been giving away tons of their headset as seen here and here. Once again fake leadership from Samsung.   For more details about VR-AR Headset shipment stats for Q1 2017, see the full IDC report here.   Cordless VR Headsets on the Way   One of the big things coming to the VR Market segment in the second half of 2017 is Wireless headsets.The big buzz out of Computex for VR was Wireless headsets using WiGig technology.   During Intel's keynote on the first day of the show, Gregory M. Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group at Intel, announced that VR was going wireless, with Intel partnering with HTC to create a VR accessory that utilizes WiGig technology to allows HTC Vive customers to get quality VR experiences without the wires.   Canada-based 60GHz WiGig (IEEE 802.11ad) wireless IC solution developer Peraso Technologies has been cooperating with many VR hardware makers to develop WiGig wireless VR devices including head-mounted displays, as well as WiGig-enabled games consoles, gaming PCs and notebooks, and USB Dongles. Devices will launch at the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017, according to company sales vice president John Tryhub. You could check out Peraso here for their new WiGig solutions and network products here.   The excitement and buzz generated at Computex was like the Wild West Gold-rush. New standards, new chips, new technologies were abundant as the VR revolution is trying to find winning technologies to catapult this new sector to being a major device category.   Yet like the gaming industry of late, consumers are losing interest as new consoles come out that are expensive and there's only a handful of decent games each year, with more than 60% being repetitive sequels. When the gaming rental business was alive and well with Blockbuster still in the market, consumers were able to experiment with new kinds of games and different titles because for $9 a weekend, how can you go wrong? With video games going for $75 a pop and higher with no rentals of top games, I find myself playing two or three games a year at tops.   At the moment VR headsets don't have great content and it'll likely be expensive when it arrives. The good news is that VR headsets are going to cover a massive range of content over time from 360-degree films to advanced games, to exciting VR movies to the medical field, to architectural firms, to real-estate agents, to new cars, infinitum.   With the high-end talent that Apple has brought onboard and technologies that they've been acquiring over the years from companies like PrimeSense, we know that Apple is going to raise the bar when it comes to Augmented Reality as well as VR when they pull the trigger.   The current stats from IDC don't really reflect the activity behind the scenes in this emerging sector that will be massive when it finally arrives. And the dumbed down screenless viewers that dominate the market thus far will be in the dust bin of history with a year or two.   Tomorrow we're likely to hear about Apple's new Siri device and it's going to be exciting to see unfold. But for Apple fans, there's a lot more to look forward to as we know that Apple's headset project well underway if not close to completion.   In 2007 the iPhone burst onto the scene exciting the market and that was quickly followed by the iPad. Now the market is getting ready for the next decade with new devices relating to AI and Augmented/Mixed Reality on the way in the not-too-distant future. It's going to be a very exciting time ahead and we can't wait to see what Apple has in store for us, starting tomorrow.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

News sign-up Google Chrome will block annoying ads News, 05 June 2017 Topics Ad blocking SAN FRANCISCO: Google has confirmed that updates to its Chrome browser early next year will block the most annoying ads that currently plague consumers. As a member of the Coalition for Better Ads, Google announced in a blog post that it will expect ads to comply with the industry group's Better Ads Standards and it urged advertisers and publishers to refer to Google's new best practice guide. "It's far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web – like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page," explained Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's SVP of Ads & Commerce. "These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads – taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation," his blog post continued. Ramaswamy added that Google is launching a new Ad Experience Report, which aims to help publishers understand how the Better Ads Standards apply to their own websites, and the report also provides a list of ads that publishers can use instead. "The vast majority of online content creators fund their work with advertising. That means they want the ads that run on their sites to be compelling, useful and engaging – ones that people actually want to see and interact with," he said. Along with its guidance on ad standards, Google also unveiled plans to help publishers deal with the worldwide rise of ad blocking software that hits their income. The company's Funding Choices tool, currently in beta, will enable publishers to send messages to users of ad blockers, inviting them either to enable ads or otherwise pay a charge via a new version Google's Contributor service. Summing up, Ramaswamy said: "We believe these changes will ensure all content creators, big and small, can continue to have a sustainable way to fund their work with online advertising."

Source: AAP 5 Jun 2017 - 9:26 AM  UPDATED 5 HOURS AGO Tweet In the wake of Britain's third terrorist attack in three months, British Prime Minister Theresa May is calling on governments to join forces to stop extremism spreading online. Here's a look at online extremism, what's being done to stop it and what could come next. Q. What are technology companies doing to stop extremist videos and other terrorist content from spreading across the internet? A. Internet companies use technology plus human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism. Google says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms. Google's YouTube removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence, and its software prevents the video from being reposted. YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015; one per cent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter teamed up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organisations. Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content. After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts. Twitter says in the last six months of 2016, it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of extremism. Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter's internal tools; just two per cent were taken down because of government requests, the company says. Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone. It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the "friends" of an account that has been removed for terrorism. Q. What are technology companies refusing to do when it comes to terrorist content? A. After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the US and UK governments sought access to encrypted - or password-protected - communication between the terrorists who carried out the attack. Apple and WhatsApp refused, although the governments eventually managed to go around the companies and get the information they wanted. Tech companies say encryption is vital and compromising it won't just stop extremists. Encryption also protects bank accounts, credit card transactions and all kinds of other information that people want to keep private. But others - including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California - have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security. Feinstein has introduced a bill to give the government so-called "back door" access to encrypted data. Q. Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A. Weakening encryption won't make people safer, says Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said. "It's playing whack-a-mole," he said. "The bad guys are not constrained by the law. That's why they're bad guys." But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally, as in times of war. He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge. "If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy," he said. Q. Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A. Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission. In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda. "This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide," Zuckerberg said. But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough, since they need users in order to sell ads. "Think of the hateful stuff that is said. How do you draw the line? And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make," he said.

ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Kenni Odelheim I said 20-40 as a guess, but it was 46k I found out afterwards... jesus man.. I snap alot :D sssgadget ~15000 Booyabobby 3075 Paul_Werner 26,263 photos currently dcdttu 47,793. I used the photos uploader on my desktop. Jorim Tielemans 78,533 photo's, that's only 3 times the amount of my bookmarks 🤐 maybe that would be a cool poll for next weekend. Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999. BigTurk Beat me by almost 2000! I got my first digital camera in 2002. Kudos to you haha Richard Riker 13,148 Shaunak Guharay 18,679 . I expected it to be somewhere around 5000, but holy shit JW 12k Joshua Ferguson 61K, I've slowed down over the last couple of years Simps 11,222 photo's and 959 albums that I have not created. Boolean Corporation Also, people like to share their sites with me... it appears... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fbf6c5a8bcd2762fb0751916cddfc1c30c07e67b2f9bc325f16d5e39a091d222.png Stoffers I've also had 1,648,103 shared with my 2 sites. Boolean Corporation So it must be the total amount of public Google Sites out there. Dn Bro I have 8,973,294...I'm not really sure where they are. exadeci https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3db3521ceda62f5bd4e638a39d5ae74f7f04e770dc7485d7a198f8b445df4f99.png Vasilj Milošević Nearly 4M over here. WTF? Where are those sites? Cheesespix Not a single :) I don't save my photos online. Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson.

Robert Porter Yes, any photo on Gphotos is analyzed. If they don't have the locations, I believe Google fills that info with your Google maps location during that time. HSidhu 000064 Photos :) David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me.

It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 12:04pm PDTJun 4, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 81 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares225 Google Google Home News Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Source: Google Product Forums Tags assistant Google google home outage subscribe ...

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm glad I got an Echo instead of that air freshener. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e084adc03d0c0fe4e62615255f95376c0df7f936c6bd8c9b188e814dfa71c29.gif Luckbuckets I wanted to disagree with your choice of the echo but that gif. but the snark over the top. awesome. Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News U.S. Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air TERROR Q&A: Internet extremism and how to combat it By DEE-ANN DURBIN Published June 04, 2017 Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Print DETROIT –  In the wake of Britain's third major attack in three months, Prime Minister Theresa May called on governments to form international agreements to prevent the spread of extremism online. Here's a look at extremism on the web, what's being done to stop it and what could come next. Q. What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content doesn't spread across the internet? A. Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism. Google, for example, says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms. Google's YouTube service removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence, and its software prevents the video from ever being reposted. YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015; 1 percent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter teamed up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organizations. Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content. After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts. Twitter says in the last six months of 2016, it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of extremism. Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter's internal tools; just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests, the company says. Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone. It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the "friends" of an account that has been removed for terrorism. Q. Why are technology companies clashing with governments over extremist communications? A. Since Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance, several tech companies have started encrypting — that is, scrambling them to thwart spies — instant messages and other data so tightly that even the companies can't read them. Governments are not happy about that. After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted messages exchanged by extremists who carried out the attacks. Apple and Facebook's WhatsApp refused, noting that they didn't hold the keys needed to unscramble such messages. Both governments eventually found other ways to get the information they wanted. Some in government — including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California — have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security. Feinstein has introduced a bill to force companies to give the government so-called "backdoor" access to encrypted data so that investigators could read messages on these services. Q. Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A. Weakening encryption won't make people safer, says Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said. "It's playing whack-a-mole," he said. "The bad guys are not constrained by the law. That's why they're bad guys." Building backdoors into encryption could also weaken it in ways that hackers, criminals and foreign agents could exploit. That could potentially jeopardize all sorts of vital data, from personal communications and documents to bank accounts, credit card transactions, medical history and other information that people want to keep private. But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally, as in times of war. He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge. "If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy," he said. Q. Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A. Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission. In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda. "This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide," Zuckerberg said. But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough, since they need users in order to sell ads. "Think of the hateful stuff that is said. How do you draw the line? And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make," he said. Others say the focus on tech companies and their responsibilities is misplaced. Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago. Instead of working together to censor the internet, Anderson says, governments and companies should work together to share information more quickly. Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence. "The bottom line is that in too many places, in too many parts of the world, you've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have," Kerry said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."

Speaker What Australian Scientists Say About Trump's Paris Climate Deal Decision Even If The Siri Speaker Sucks You'll Want It Adam Clark Estes Jun 5, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  alexa amazon echo apple google assistant google home siri steve jobs Share Image: Getty / Gizmodo We all know Apple's game by now. Wait in the wings while all of the other companies fuck up while trying to innovate, and then, just when it seems almost too late, introduce a product that does the same thing as everybody else's product, but better. This is bound to be true with the rumoured Siri speaker. The idea is oddly exciting. It's widely believed that, on Monday, Apple will reveal this so-called Siri speaker. The voice-controlled device is supposed to be a lot like the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, except, you know, it's an Apple product. That means it will look great, work great, and cost a great sum of money. According to rumours, that also means that the gadget will lack some of the flashy features of seen in the current contenders on the market. The Siri speaker probably won't have a touchscreen, like the new Amazon Echo Show. It probably won't have a built-in wi-fi router, like the rumoured Google Home hardware update. Your Move, Apple It feels like it's 2001. A ton of companies had released a ton of MP3 players, and they all sucked. The iPod was just months away. But it's 2016, and instead we're drowning in smarthome gadgets, most recently the voice-powered Amazon Echo and whatever Google Home is. Read more That's kind of the point, though. Apple is famous for releasing first generation products that do just enough, really well. Just think about the original iPod, which celebrates its sweet 16 this year. The market was flooded with problematic MP3 players by the time Steve Jobs announced Apple's magical solution in October 2001. Jobs himself explained how companies small and large were trying and failing to build music players. "They haven't found the recipe," Jobs said at that event, moments before revealing the iPod. "No one has really found the recipe yet for digital music." Now get ready for the good shit. "And we think," Jobs continued, "not only can we find the recipe, but we think the Apple brand is going to be fantastic, because people trust the Apple brand to get their great digital electronics from." You can just imagine those exact same words coming out of Tim Cook's mouth on Monday to describe Apple's entry into the smart speaker market. Lots of companies, large and small, have tried to sell an internet-connected, voice-controlled speaker for the home. None of them are awesome. Amazon's had the most success with Echo, largely because it was the first mega tech company to introduce a viable option. Echo gained steam as a smart home hub, too, because Amazon let virtually any company develop the capability to work with Alexa, Amazon's half-decent, artificially intelligent assistant. And despite its relative dominance in the information space, Google's smart speaker, blandly named "Home," has struggled to take a bite out of Amazon's market share. So here comes Apple. If the Cupertino kids do announce a new piece of hardware at the WWDC conference this year, it will almost certainly be some sort of smart speaker. People are calling it the "Siri speaker," because such a device would use Siri's computer brain power to respond to voice commands and questions. We can also expect an upgrade to Siri, perhaps a new version that can distinguish between different voices and maintain multiple user profiles. (Google Home already does this, and Amazon is expected to release the feature soon.) Otherwise, the Siri speaker will probably do the same things as the Home and the Echo — only, hopefully, better. After all, Apple is increasingly admitting that it's a luxury brand. For a smart speaker, that would mean that the sound quality would far surpass the tin-can tones of an Echo. Some rumours claim that Apple actually wants to take on Sonos in offering high-quality wireless audio throughout the home with exceptional acoustics and the processing power of an iPhone 6. Meanwhile, we have to expect Apple to flex its dominance in the privacy and security spheres. As too many people clutch their pearls over the idea of an Echo recording all of their conversations, the market is definitely primed for a safe-seeming smart speaker. It will also — Jony Ive voice — be an extraordinarily beautiful object. A design porn shot from an iPad Pro promotional video (Image: YouTube) But this all begs the question: who's going to buy this new Apple object? It's not immediately obvious that people need a smart speaker in the same way that they needed a smartphone when Apple released the iPhone ten years ago. Then again, nobody needed a smartwatch when the Apple Watch came out and now it's the number one product in the category. Is it because the Apple Watch is the very best wearable computer? Who knows. Do people trust the Apple brand to build great digital electronics? A lot of them do, yes. Even more powerful than that, however, is the fact that a lot people will buy a new gadget simply because Apple made it. Call them fanboys or girls or whatever you want, but Apple loyalists are fucking loyal. Steve Jobs programmed them to be. From the early Mac days, the late visionary excelled at convincing people that electronics were their friends. After all, way back in 1984, the original Macintosh computer gave its own robotic but revolutionary introduction speech. "I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself," Job said, and the computer did. The crowd went wild. We don't know what will happen at WWDC 2017. If Apple does announce a smart speaker, maybe Tim Cook will invite Siri will make the announcement herself (itself?). There's a good chance the device won't be available until the fall, a move that would echo Google's announcing the Home last spring for a fall release. Of course, Apple might also let us all down and announce some boring new iPad update or no new hardware at all. But if Apple does decide to join the smart speaker circus, the company will almost certainly do it as Steve Jobs would have wanted. The gadget will be simple. It will be beautiful. It will work. It will sort of suck, but that's why you have to stick around to buy the second generation — and the third and the fourth until infinity.

Reply 1 I'm posting as a Guest Jun 5, 2017, 11:51am Apple is reportedly making an AI chip that can be used to allow siri to process the voice locally rather than send it to a server somewhere (https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/26/15702248/apple-neural-engine-ai-chip-iphone-ipad). Seems like a perfect fit for a smart speaker. Control your home without needing an internet connection for speech interpretation. Reply 0 klaw @klaw Jun 5, 2017, 12:08pm I have no doubt it will be beautiful. I have no doubt that it will work well within the Apple ecosystem. It will probably include a quirky feature that sets it apart from other products - a branded reproduction of something commonplace, with a catchy marketing buzzword masquerading as new tech, that the fawning press will breathlessly report. However, it will almost certainly be missing features that it clearly should have - you've got to leave something for the 2nd generation product that will convince owners to upgrade. And if it's anything like Siri on other iOS products, it will probably misunderstand every second phrase. Lastly, it will almost certainly be ludicrously over-priced. This will give rise to a plethora of articles by frenzied fanboy journalists, who will immediately declare all other competing products as being flawed and obsolete in any number of ridiculous ways in an attempt to justify this new expensive toy in all kinds of hilarious ways. I look forward to the mayhem, and being proven right. Reply 1 Almost Guest Jun 5, 2017, 12:34pm "... that does the same thing as everybody else's product, but better." You mean like Apple Maps?

NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

(Andrew Matthews/PA vía AP) DETROIT (AP) — In the wake of Britain's third major attack in three months, Prime Minister Theresa May called on governments to form international agreements to prevent the spread of extremism online. Here's a look at extremism on the web, what's being done to stop it and what could come next. Q. What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content doesn't spread across the internet? A. Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism. Google, for example, says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms. Google's YouTube service removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence, and its software prevents the video from ever being reposted. YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015; 1 percent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter teamed up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organizations. Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content. After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts. Twitter says in the last six months of 2016, it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of extremism. Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter's internal tools; just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests, the company says. Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone. It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the "friends" of an account that has been removed for terrorism. Q. Why are technology companies clashing with governments over extremist communications? A. Since Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance, several tech companies have started encrypting — that is, scrambling them to thwart spies — instant messages and other data so tightly that even the companies can't read them. Governments are not happy about that. After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted messages exchanged by extremists who carried out the attacks. Apple and Facebook's WhatsApp refused, noting that they didn't hold the keys needed to unscramble such messages. Both governments eventually found other ways to get the information they wanted. Some in government — including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California — have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security. Feinstein has introduced a bill to force companies to give the government so-called "backdoor" access to encrypted data so that investigators could read messages on these services. Q. Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A. Weakening encryption won't make people safer, says Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said. "It's playing whack-a-mole," he said. "The bad guys are not constrained by the law. That's why they're bad guys." Building backdoors into encryption could also weaken it in ways that hackers, criminals and foreign agents could exploit. That could potentially jeopardize all sorts of vital data, from personal communications and documents to bank accounts, credit card transactions, medical history and other information that people want to keep private. But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally, as in times of war. He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge. "If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy," he said. Q. Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A. Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission. In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda. "This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide," Zuckerberg said. But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough, since they need users in order to sell ads. "Think of the hateful stuff that is said. How do you draw the line? And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make," he said. Others say the focus on tech companies and their responsibilities is misplaced. Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago. Instead of working together to censor the internet, Anderson says, governments and companies should work together to share information more quickly. Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence. "The bottom line is that in too many places, in too many parts of the world, you've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have," Kerry said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."

 Google doesn't underpay its female employees but it could have a different problem with women, data shows Julie Bort Apr. 12, 2017, 5:25 PM 7,345 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI The US Department of Labor says that Google appears to systematically underpay women and that it has seen "compelling evidence" of "very significant discrimination against women," Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified in a San Francisco court on Friday, according to The Guardian. But Google says it does no such thing and has the data to prove it (though it hasn't released any of that data). Google conducts an annual analysis of pay equality that is "extremely scientific and robust" and gender "blind," Google's vice president of people operations, Eileen Naughton, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Naughton says that if the analysis finds that a demographic group, like women, are being underpaid, it adjusts their pay accordingly. At first glance, it would seem that if one of them is telling the truth, the other can't be. But they could both be right, according to analysis of Google's pay between women and men done by Glassdoor's Chief Economist, Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, who shared its research with Business Insider. Glassdoor examined the thousands of self-reported salaries that Google employees voluntarily shared with the job-hunting site. It's not a complete picture of pay at Google, but it's a good sample size to look for trends. Glassdoor's data found that women and men who do similar jobs with similar backgrounds at Google do typically get paid the same, backing up Naughton's assertions. However, all told, women at Google are still paid 16% less than the men, this Glassdoor data also finds. The rub is that of the women who work at Google, fewer of them are among the ranks of the highest paying jobs at Google, compared to the percentage of men who have those jobs in relation to the number of men who work there, Glassdoor finds.  "In our sample of Google salaries, men and women are definitely not equally represented among job titles. For example, about 52 percent of males in our data worked as highly paid software engineers, while just 21 percent of women worked in those roles. By contrast, 6 percent of women in the sample worked as product marketing managers, while just 2 percent of men worked in those roles," Chamberlain says. Economists call this "occupational segregation," Chamberlain says, and it's a common and major contributor to the gender pay gap.  This is not a unique situation to Google. In fact, a year ago, Glassdoor examined the issue and found "this pattern of men and women working in different job roles explained about 54 percent of the overall U.S. gender pay gap," he says. But it could explain how Google might be accused of "systematically" underpaying while claiming it does pay equally for equal work.  "Men and women for a variety of reasons tend to be sorted into different jobs — even within the same company — and those different roles pay differently," he says. "This new research shows this same phenomenon likely explains much of any overall gender pay gap at companies like Google as well." Get the latest Google stock price here.

CELEBRITIES Google Hangouts a Haven for Scams, Possible Conduit for Islamic State Google Aids in Blackmail, Sex, Marriage Scams By Keith Girard, March 15th, 2016 Do you know these women? The are out to steal your hearts and money on Google Hangouts. Clockwise from top left, they go by Francois Shaibend, Carine Surgers, Justine Bissett and Ange Leroy. They could be part of organized crime groups and should be considered dangerous. (Photo: Google Hangouts)Google Hangouts, the Internet giant’s answer to Facebook and other social media outlets, is a fertile hunting ground for organized crime groups that could be fronts for the Islamic State. They are using the service to con tens of thousands of dollars from unwitting users through blackmail and sex and marriage scams, a special IM investigation has learned. TheImproper’s six-week investigation barely scratches the surface on the level of organized activity. But the probe uncovered concrete evidence that well organized groups are prowling Google’s social media site for victims. First in a Series There is a special place in hell for people who pray on the kindness, generosity and loneliness of others. But our investigation discovered a more sinister, temporal threat–the Islamic State and other terror groups. Lonely Heart Scams: How They Do It The women, working on a commission basis from an “office,” set up false profiles, typically on internet dating sites. They find their victims and then enter into correspondence with a lot of people simultaneously using a pre-arranged script. They first ask for money for the visa, and then for other expenses. Once one of their victim forwards money using Western Union or Money Gram, they notify their bosses. After the money is collected, the ‘worker’ receives their commission. They will then try to get more money out of the victim. However, once someone sends money for a ticket that is usually the last they hear from the “true love.” Source: spamlaws.com Google’s social media site has few controls and multiple avenues for deception that makes it perfect for the Islamic State and other groups to raise funds surreptitiously through various scams. During the course of our investigation, IM was able to penetrate two distinct groups of scammers. They went to extreme lengths to lure us into their sex and blackmail trap. All conversations were recorded. In each case, the process began when a young attractive female asked to join our circle. In our case, four different women asked to join IM’s Google-Plus, which was set up in the name of IM Editor & Publisher Keith Girard. Google’s social media platform is conducive to scams because it allows private chat conversations between circle members. In each case, the women used Google’s private chat to initiate contact. A woman who identified herself as Francois Shailene sent this suggestive photograph to encourage our conversation with her. (Photo: Francois Shaibend) The women also engaged in identity theft to set up their profiles to cover their tracks. One instance involved a woman who said her name was Carine Surgars. She said she worked for Medical Pharmacies Group Inc., , a French conglomerate. She also said she attended St Therese’s School, a well-known French Catholic school. But the IM investigation was able to determine that the identity actually belonged to another woman, who was not related to the scam. The effort was clearly organized, because the two women we spoke with followed the same script, almost word-for-word. Carine was also assisted by a man who often posed as her in conversations. Carine set up the scam by claiming she was an only child; her parents were dead. She said she had just gone through a devastating breakup with her boyfriend. She had been without sex for six months, she said, and yearned to find a “true love” to marry. Read More –Francoise Shaibend: Anatomy of Sex, Money, Marriage Scam on Google Plus –Google Sex Scam Queen: ‘Devil in Flesh of a Fairy’ Preys on Lonely Heart Men A second woman, Francois Shaibend , gave us the exact same story. The women involved proved to be well-school in deception. But sometimes they tripped up on simple details that revealed their fraud. Carine, for example, initially posed as a pious conservative French Catholic girl. She said she was looking for a similarly religious husband. She said she not only attended Catholic school, but attended church every week and devoutly believed in God. Yet, when she was asked about the Papal Schism of 1378, which laid the foundation for the French Catholic Church, she didn’t know anything about it. The Papal Schism is taught in every French Catholic school and underlies the religion today. But she was clueless, a major red flag. “Carine Surgers” is pictured chatting with us on Skype. Her identity later proved to be stolen. She said she was a devout Catholic, but she later stripped on camera twice. (Photo: ScreenCap) Although the IM investigation initially focused on four women, we chose to respond to Francois and Carine. We wanted to learn how they operated. What we found was shocking. We let Francois play out her scam unimpeded from start to finish, which of course ended with a plea for money. She never knew we were onto her. In the second instance, IM confronted Carine. We revealed our evidence of identity theft and other mis-steps exposing her fraud. We hoped to shame her into dropping her ruse, thinking she would discuss the scam with us candidly. But she proved to be tough and determined. At one point, we asked to see her driver’s license or passport to prove her identity. She refused to do so and abruptly ended the conversation. After that, we thought she would move on. But shockingly she continued contacting us. Throughout our sometimes heated confrontations over her identity, she stuck doggedly to her script. Indeed, she doubled down on the deception. She insisted she was telling the truth, pleaded for trust and swore she wanted marriage. She continued to contact us even after we told her it was over. The hook she and Francois tried to use was the promise of love, marriage, children–and sex. She professed her deep love over and over, and her wish to get married. We talked about baby names, how many children we wanted, intimate conversations that real lovers often share. But her motive was heartless and cruel. She repeatedly asked us to trust her and promised she would never hurt us. There may have been a good reason for her efforts. IM invited her into our life, which incuded a garage full of expensive cars, a sprawling country mansion and a well-appointed New York City apartment. Francois made a bid to hold our attention by sending us this photo midway through our conversation. The images would get far more risque as the scam progressed. The identity meshed perfectly with her ploy. “One of the cruelest scams is the Lonely Hearts Scam,” according to a Web site devoted to Internet fraud. “With this scam people are fooled into thinking that they have met their ‘true love’ online. The victim then sends their ‘true love’ money so they can meet,” according to the site. Once they get the money, the disappear or come back for more. The scams originated on online dating sites. But most major sites have cracked down on fraudulent profiles. Google hangouts, however, is wide open. Scammers appear to be setting up shop there in droves. Carine’s story fit the scam to a tee. She said she’d just ended a year-long relationship, after discovering her boyfriend was sleeping with a “friend of a friend.” Devastated, she said she decided to be “guided by God.” He would help her find her “one true love” on, of all places, the Internet. That brought her to our doorstep. While she appeared to closely follow a script, she didn’t hesitate to modify her approach when necessary. During one conversation, we told her we weren’t particularly religious. Suddenly her devout Catholicism faded to the background. As for Christian morals, Carine had no problem performing a striptease–twice– over Skype as our “relationship” deepened. Carine, incidentally, is a beautiful woman with long auburn hair, whimsical eyes and at 5-feet, 8-inches tall, a model’s body. We figured her to be in her mid-twenties, but she insisted she was 33 years old. On her Google platform, she claims to be 37. She simply said she looked younger than her age. But we suspect she was trying to close the age gap between her and older men to make her seem a more plausible match. The conversations with her, conducted over Google chat and Skype, were often deeply intimate, with intense conversations about sex and a future of marriage and children “with my man.” We made up nicknames for each other. We talked how it felt to be deeply in love. All the while, she professed how lonely she was. Yet IM was able to obtain a list of her Skype contacts. It contained more than two dozen men, all about the same age. They were located in Britain, Europe and all over the world. In fact, Carine has more than 800 followers in her Google hangout. They are overwhelmingly men. Presumably she proposed to marry them all. As the conversations progressed both women peppered their deception with scantily clad photos, each more risque than the last. The intent was clearly to keep the conversation going. All of the women who contacted us were French, or professed to be French. But they raised at least the possibility of a terrorist connection because of their ties to African locations. Carine said she was French, but she spoke to us during our entire conversation from the Ivory Coast. The African nation and former French colony, has a surly reputation. It’s known as a trans-shipment point for South American cocaine destined for Marseilles in France. It’s also known as a haven for money laundering. Islamic terrorists are known to be active in the country, evidence by the devastating attack on tourists Sunday (Mar. 13). At least four men armed with AK47s and hand grenades killed 16 people, including four Europeans, in the historic town of Grand Bassam. The men are said to have links to al Qaeda, according to London’s Daily Mail. Our conversation took a chilling turn, when we discovered we weren’t necessarily talking to Carine in every conversation. IM’s Skype is equipped with software to record audio and video calls. Because of language differences all conversations were conducted in writing. Nonetheless, we kept our audio on to record possible background conversations. During one discussion with “Carine,” it actually paid off. We learned we were actually talking with a man, who had stupidly left his audio on. We could hear him coughing and hacking in a husky voice, as he pounded heavily on his keyboard. Yet the conversation–as it appeared on Skype–was intimate and genteel. He wrote about love and marriage. He played the role to the hilt, albeit clumsily. We also noticed distinct differences in syntax and sentence structure that clearly suggested someone else was on the line. That prompted us to go back over our chat records. We discovered subtle differences in syntax and sentence structure in other conversations as well. It clearly suggested we were talking with different people at different times, even though Carine was supposed to be our only contact. As Carine continued with her scam, she and/or her group were also suspicious of us. During conversations, she would asked us to scan the room with our Skype cam. She wanted to see if we were actually where we said we were. In another instance, she–or we suspect the man posing as her–insisted that we call her cell phone so she could have our phone number “close to her heart.” After we feigned outrage about her suspicion, she/he admitted she was trying to determine our location by observing the country code from our call. The fact that we were being manipulated was sometimes obvious. On a couple of occasions, she suddenly and heatedly accused us of being married with children, especially during intimate moments. On other occasions, she asked us to turn on our camera when the conversation turned sexual. The effort appeared to be an attempt build evidence for a possible blackmail attempt. At least twice she asked to see our “little head” on camera. Following my encounter with the coughing man, I spoke to the real Carine, who had turned on her camera to confirm her identity. I thanked her profusely for agreeing so willingly the night before to have anal and oral sex. She said, without hesitation, that she would do it for “her man.” Trouble is, the conversation never took place. We made it up to test her. She had no clue what was said, a clear indication someone else was posing as her. We said nothing about the contradiction. But this would become par for the course. The fact is, many men think they are talking to women in these Internet relationships. But unless there is confirmation by camera, chances are the victims are talking to men posing as the women. On our night of romance with the hacking man, for example, he refused several times to turn on the camera, claiming the Internet connection was bad, another clear red flag. Francois’s scam incorporated nearly all of the same elements, but it was impossible to determine her exact location or her sex. For all we know, she could have been a man as well. She refused to use Skype or a camera and would only communicate through Google Chat. Franscois clearly lacked the sophistication of Carine’s criminal enterprise, which suggested she could have been acting alone. Yet, both women went to great lengths to perpetrate their frauds. Amid the shower of semi-nude photos, Francois even sent us photos of her purported pet dog, a black poodle, named Mido. But when we asked for a photo of her with the dog, she said she didn’t have one. Was it just another prop to ease our suspicion? Francois also talked at length about her desire to get married, and she talked intimately about sex. But before too long, she steered the conversation to money. Like Carine, she also had an African connection. She said she routinely traveled to Casablanca, Morocco, on business. She claimed she bought and sold Moroccan art work. After teeing us up with small talk, she set us up for the take down. She told us she was planning to travel to Morocco via Paris to buy goods. A few days later, she contacted us to say she was in Paris to arrange financing for her Moroccan trip. That’s when a problem arose. She couldn’t get the money she needed. So, she asked for our help. She said she only needed $2,000. We could easily send it to her via Western Union, she added. We decided to start scamming the scammer. To put her off without raising suspicion, we said the U.S. government had recently enacted tough, new restrictions on money transfers outside the country because of our war with the Islamic State. Our bank, we said, would likely block a transfer by Western Union because there was no business connection between us. So, she immediately suggested other fraudulent methods. She said she would pose as our wife to ease the transaction. Then she agreed to open a bank account in our name only, so the transfer would not arouse suspicion. But when we told her she would need to deposit a countervailing balance equal to the amount we were depositing, she balked at the idea. We said we would travel to Paris with the money, so we could finally consummate our love before her trip. She quickly balked at that idea, as well. When we asked her if she might need more money, given the complications; she upped her request to $3,500. The money, of course, was never transferred. But we got what we wanted; she played her hand, giving us a window into her method of operation and her attempted fraud. It’s clear these women have no real interest in meeting or getting married. Carine was much more subtle in her approach, but finally began hinting she wanted money. After more than two weeks of conversation, she let us know she liked expensive clothes. She modeled a Ralph Lauren shirt. We offered to meet her in Cannes to consummate our love. We also promised to take her shopping and to buy her anything she wanted. Not surprisingly, she declined. With her fraud clearly established, we finally ended our relationship with a brutal putdown. Our final words to her were simply “fuck off.” Yet the next day, she reached out to us again, begging to continue the relationship. We have calls out to Google, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for their reaction. We are also reaching out to authorities in France and the Ivory Coast. Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below and be sure to follow IM for ground-breaking investigative reports.

Of course I feel stupid now, but she was so convincing, and worked me so skilfully, I was convinced. I agree that this type of scam is odious, I was extremely vulnerable at the time, and it left me with a feeling of devastation, as well as poorer, when I finally had to accept the obvious and block the calls.

For Apple, its Siri voice assistant remains popular, but for the first time in a while, it’s feeling the heat from the competition. In a SurveyMonkey Audience poll for USA Today, 33 percent of those responding said they use Apple’s Siri the most regularly. The survey’s other findings follow a rough split of general smartphone marketshare: 19 percent of respondents used Google Assistant, 6 percent named Amazon’s Alexa as their primary assistant and a middling 4 percent named Microsoft’s Cortana as their main assistant. Read: Siri Speaker To Be Unveiled At WWDC, Apple Already Manufacturing Device Overseas USA Today noted part of Siri’s popularity comes from the assistant’s head start. Apple’s iPhone remains a leader in the smartphone market and Siri has been available to users since 2011. Other entries have generally struggled to crack this market share, either due to their reach — devices like Amazon’s Alexa solely have been on its home Echo devices — or relative newness. But at the same time, Siri is now facing significant competition from others. Within the last year, virtual assistants have expanded significantly into the home market. Amazon’s Echo assistants are built with Alexa and have made significant inroads among home users as Alexa can do everything from playing music to ordering Amazon products. Amazon also plans to invest even more heavily into the Alexa platform in the upcoming year. Upcoming devices like the Echo Show will combine Alexa with a physical touchscreen and Amazon’s open approach to Alexa has allowed developers to bring the assistant to product families ranging from TVs to home appliances. Investment and development also have been coming from companies besides Amazon. Microsoft teased a partner home speaker for Cortana earlier this year and Google has worked to bring Google Assistant to more devices alongside its Google Home personal assistant. Even Samsung has touted its own Bixby personal home assistant heavily although it remains a work in progress on its flagship Galaxy S8. Amid all this development, though, Apple’s Siri has remained largely static. The assistant has stayed out of the home space though Apple is reportedly planning on debuting its own home assistant at its Worldwide Developers Conference this month. Read: Dish Partners With Amazon To Bring Echo And Alexa Voice Control To Dish DVRs Functionally, Apple’s Siri also lies a step or two behind its competitors. In USA Today’s own testing, Google Assistant provided a better experience than Amazon’s Alexa and Apple's Siri. Even in day-to-day use, Siri has generally been an adequate, if basic, client. Siri can handle basic requests about facts like the weather or your location but often struggles to handle more complex contextual requests. At its Galaxy S8 press conference, Samsung made a point of demonstrating its Bixby client understanding a multipart question. Apple generally has been fine taking its time versus releasing products solely to keep up with the competition. For products like the iPhone or iPad, the company often has prioritized being the best over being first. But against an increasingly competitive field for home assistants, Apple’s Siri knows it needs to innovate and enter the space aggressively or risk being left behind.

Here's a look at extremism on the web, what's being done to stop it and what could come next. Q. What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content doesn't spread across the internet? A. Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism. Google, for example, says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms. Google's YouTube service removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence, and its software prevents the video from ever being reposted. YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015; 1 percent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter teamed up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organizations. Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content. After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts. Twitter says in the last six months of 2016, it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of extremism. Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter's internal tools; just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests, the company says. Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone. It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the "friends" of an account that has been removed for terrorism. Q. Why are technology companies clashing with governments over extremist communications? A. Since Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance, several tech companies have started encrypting - that is, scrambling them to thwart spies - instant messages and other data so tightly that even the companies can't read them. Governments are not happy about that. After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted messages exchanged by extremists who carried out the attacks. Apple and Facebook's WhatsApp refused, noting that they didn't hold the keys needed to unscramble such messages. Both governments eventually found other ways to get the information they wanted. Some in government - including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California - have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security. Feinstein has introduced a bill to force companies to give the government so-called "backdoor" access to encrypted data so that investigators could read messages on these services. Q. Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A. Weakening encryption won't make people safer, says Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said. "It's playing whack-a-mole," he said. "The bad guys are not constrained by the law. That's why they're bad guys." Building backdoors into encryption could also weaken it in ways that hackers, criminals and foreign agents could exploit. That could potentially jeopardize all sorts of vital data, from personal communications and documents to bank accounts, credit card transactions, medical history and other information that people want to keep private. But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally, as in times of war. He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge. "If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy," he said. Q. Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A. Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission. In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda. "This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide," Zuckerberg said. But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough, since they need users in order to sell ads. "Think of the hateful stuff that is said. How do you draw the line? And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make," he said. Others say the focus on tech companies and their responsibilities is misplaced. Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago. Instead of working together to censor the internet, Anderson says, governments and companies should work together to share information more quickly. Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence. "The bottom line is that in too many places, in too many parts of the world, you've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have," Kerry said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." © 2017 The Associated Press.

It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 12:04pm PDTJun 4, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 81 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares225 Google Google Home News Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Source: Google Product Forums Tags assistant Google google home outage subscribe ...

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm glad I got an Echo instead of that air freshener. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e084adc03d0c0fe4e62615255f95376c0df7f936c6bd8c9b188e814dfa71c29.gif Luckbuckets I wanted to disagree with your choice of the echo but that gif. but the snark over the top. awesome. Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime.

It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 12:04pm PDTJun 4, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 81 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares225 Google Google Home News Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Source: Google Product Forums Tags assistant Google google home outage subscribe ...

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm glad I got an Echo instead of that air freshener. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e084adc03d0c0fe4e62615255f95376c0df7f936c6bd8c9b188e814dfa71c29.gif Luckbuckets I wanted to disagree with your choice of the echo but that gif. but the snark over the top. awesome. Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime.

The facilities will include a cafe, gym and pool as well as a rooftop track and ground-floor retail spaces, according to the company's application for permission to build. The campus has been designed by an all-star team that includes Thomas Heatherwick, the British designer behind London's 2012 Olympic cauldron, and Danish architect Bjarke Ingels' BIG firm. CNN After 0 successful submissions, Google quadruples top reward for hacking Android to $200,000 Google has paid security researchers millions of dollars since launching its bug bounty program in 2010. The company today expanded its Android Security Rewards program because “no researcher has claimed the top reward for an exploit chain in two years.” Right. Well, the program has only been around for two years — a Google spokesperson confirmed that nobody has ever claimed the top reward. Venture Beat Intel CEO sees VR sports as a billion dollar business Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Axios on Thursday that he sees virtual reality not only changing the face of sports, but also potentially being a multi-billion-dollar business for the chip giant. "I think it can be a couple billion dollar business" he said in an interview after his appearance at Code Conference. "And the reason is this is a whole new feed... things like advertising, the ability to take that data and sell it... we're the only ones who we believe can produce this stuff." Axios Why we're suing the FBI for records about Best Buy Geek Squad informants Sending your computer to Best Buy for repairs shouldn’t require you to surrender your Fourth Amendment rights. But that’s apparently what’s been happening when customers send their computers to a Geek Squad repair facility in Kentucky. We think the FBI’s use of Best Buy Geek Squad employees to search people’s computers without a warrant threatens to circumvent people’s constitutional rights. EFF Walmart is turning its employees into delivery drivers to compete with Amazon Walmart, which is aggressively investing in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon, is unveiling a new strategy: turning its army of 1.5 million US employees into delivery drivers. The tactic is being tested at three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas, and designed to shave costs out of the “last mile” of distribution, the most expensive part of getting goods to customers. Quartz Exploring DynamIQ and ARM’s New CPUs: Cortex-A75, Cortex-A55 ARM moves at an aggressive pace, pushing out new processor IP on a yearly cadence. It needs to move fast partly because it has so many partners across so many industries to keep happy and partly because it needs to keep up with the technology its IP comes into contact with, everything from new process nodes to higher quality displays to artificial intelligence. To keep pace, ARM keeps multiple design teams in several different locations all working in parallel. AnandTech Is “I forget” a valid defense when court orders demand a smartphone password? On May 30, two suspects accused of extorting the so-called "Queen of Snapchat" as part of a sex-tape scandal are scheduled to appear in a Florida court. But as wild as the premise sounds, primarily the accused need only to answer a simple question on this visit. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Charles Johnson wants an explanation as to why Hencha Voigt and her then boyfriend, Wesley Victor, can't remember the passcodes to their mobile phones. Ars Technica 51 GPUs tested, from the Radeon HD 2900XT to RX 580 & R9 Fury: Testing the 2017 Linux driver stack It's that time of the year where we see how the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver stack is working on past and present hardware in a large GPU comparison with various OpenGL games and workloads. This year we go from the new Radeon RX 580 all the way back to the Radeon HD 2900XT, looking at how the mature Radeon DRM kernel driver and R600 Gallium3D driver is working for aging ATI/AMD graphics hardware. Phoronix Chrome bug allows sites to record audio and video without a visual indicator Ran Bar-Zik, a web developer at AOL, has discovered and reported a bug in Google Chrome that allows websites to record audio and video without showing a visual indicator. The bug is not as bad as it sounds, as the malicious website still needs to get the user's permission to access audio and video components, but there are various ways in which this issue could be weaponized to record audio or video without the user's knowledge. Bleeping Computer Does your video game have too many words? (Yeah, probably.) My whole career has been based on writing very story-heavy games, with lots of words. Our company, Spiderweb Software, is small. We can't afford fancy graphics, so we have to rely on words. Interesting, quality words. We're currently remastering the series with our most loved story and our bestest words. We also finished a new series, which had a lot of words which I suspect weren't as good because it didn't sell as well. Gamasutra Hollywood sees illegal streaming devices as ‘piracy 3.0’ Piracy remains a major threat for the movie industry, MPA Stan McCoy said yesterday during a panel session at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. After McCoy praised the collaboration between the MPA(A) and Russian authorities in their fight against online piracy, the ‎President and Managing Director of the MPA’s EMEA region noted that pirates are not standing still.

The company demoed both screens at DisplayWeek 2017. Electroluminescent QLED is an emissive technology, like OLED and plasma before it. AVS Forum What really happened with Vista I generally have posted about things that I have been directly involved with — either code I wrote or projects I managed. In this post I am taking a different tack to write about my perspective on the underlying causes of the Windows Vista (codename Longhorn) debacle. While this happened over a decade ago, this was a crucial period in the shift to mobile and had long-running consequences internally to Microsoft. Hacker Noon Hack brief: Dangerous ‘Fireball’ adware infects a quarter billion PCs Adware that infects your computer to display pop-ups is an annoyance. But when it infects as many as one in five networks in the world, and hides the capability to do far more serious damage to its victims, it’s an epidemic waiting to happen.

While Apple offers a uniform experience across its devices (and often a higher resale value) the Android phones are often cheaper. Read more: Apple launches iPhone 7 Red and we love it! And as Google showed with its recent I/O conference, there's a lot of impressive features on Android devices like the Pixel phone. But ahead of its own developer conference - the coveted WWDC - Apple has launched a new campaign dedicated to winning over Android users to iPhone. The "Switch to iPhone" campaign has its own subsection on Apple's website where the company lays out how easy it is to swap over. Boldly claiming that "Life is easier on iPhone", the campaign has various questions and answers about why gadget fans might favour Apple. There's also information on battery life, privacy and Apple's own commitment to environmental policies. "There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you," explains Apple. Read more: No more distracted driving with this exciting new Apple Watch feature When it comes to owning the mobile market, Android far outstrips Apple's iOS. That's because Google allows any manufacturer to use its software on its devices. That means whether its the high-end Samsung Galaxy S8 or low-price Moto X it still runs the same software, and Google gets the credit. During its quarterly earnings calls, when Apple reveals its numbers to investors, one key factor is often how many users have switched from Android to iOS. "We saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China that we've ever seen in the same period," Apple boss Tim Cook said at the last Apple earnings call. As Google continues to innovate with Android, Apple has to push hard to make sure it retains a decent segment of the mobile market.

It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 12:04pm PDTJun 4, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 81 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares225 Google Google Home News Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Source: Google Product Forums Tags assistant Google google home outage subscribe ...

The Prime Minister today accused the likes of Facebook and Google of giving terrorist ideology “the safe space needed to breed”. Politicians from all the major parties also blasted social media firms for failing to act more swiftly in taking down extremist material. Repeating her comments from last month’s G7 summit, the PM said: “We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. Yet that is precisely what the internet – and the big companies that provide internet-based services – provide. “We need to work with allied, democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremism and terrorist planning.” London Bridge in the aftermath of the attack this morning (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Google said it was working on strengthening in the area (Photo: PA) Read More 'Give us more armed police or terror death toll could be ten times worse' say security experts Labour MP John Mann went further and urged Government to prosecute firms that allow extremist material to be shared. He said: “I repeat my call for the internet companies who terrorists have again used to communicate to be held legally liable for content.” Former Tory Cabinet Minister Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC the latest attack should be “the final straw” for web firms. He said members of the public had complained the companies were “quick to use your data, very slow to close down really dodgy data”. But ex-Met Police chief Lord Brian Paddick said action would only work with an international agreement. Brian Paddick said international agreement was needed (Photo: PA) The Lib Dem peer said: “We know from what we’ve tried with online pornography that, other than blocking websites completely, there is nothing we can do in the UK about US-based companies. So it’s got to be co-operation, particularly with the US.” Read More Dramatic footage captures moment armed police kill three London Bridge terrorists by firing 50 bullets at them And he warned against ending encrypted messaging by services such as WhatsApp. The issue was highlighted by Home Secretary Amber Rudd after Westminster terrorist Khalid Masood ’s attack. The killer used the service shortly before his atrocity. Lord Paddick said: “Encryption is there to protect people. Banks use it. All sorts of people use it. “It can [already] be got round by the security services by tapping into people’s phones and computers.” As armed police were seen outside The Shard yesterday, next to London Bridge station, internet firms insisted they were fighting online extremism. Facebook said it worked aggressively to remove terrorist content (Photo: Getty) A spokesman for Google said: “We’re already working with industry colleagues on an international forum to accelerate and strengthen our existing work in this area. We employ thousands of people and invest hundreds of millions of pounds to fight abuse on our platforms.” Facebook policy director Simon Milner said: “Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it.” And Nick Pickles, UK Head of Public Policy for Twitter, said: “We continue to expand the use of technology as part of a systematic approach to removing this type of content. We will never stop working to stay one step ahead and will continue to engage with our partners across industry, government, civil society and academia.” Paramedics take a victim away last night (Photo: AFP) A policeman at a cordon (Photo: PA) Meanwhile opponents of tougher internet regulation hit out at the PM for blaming websites. Digital campaigners the Open Rights Group said: “The internet and companies like Facebook are not a cause of this hatred and violence, but tools that can be abused.” They added: “Theresa May could push these vile networks into even darker corners of the web, where they will be even harder to observe.” Prof Peter Neumann, of the International Centre for the Study Of Radicalisation at King’s College London, tweeted: “Few people radicalised exclusively online. Blaming social media platforms is politically convenient but intellectually lazy.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Google Terrorism Terror attacks Theresa May Facebook London Bridge terror attack News all Most Read Most Recent LionsLions rescued from circus and flown to Africa to keep them 'safe' butchered in suspected witchcraft killing Male lions Jose and Liso were found with their heads severed and their paws hacked off for potions and charms London Bridge terror attackMan flees London Bridge terror attack still holding pint of beer in his hand - and Brits couldn't be more proud The image has been shared thousands of times, with Brits defending it as using "our dark humour helping us to cope" London Bridge terror attackFamily of London Bridge terrorist killed by police say 'we just want to grieve in peace' The 27-year-old attacker, currently identified only as 'Abz', lived in Barking, East London with his wife and two young children London Bridge terror attackFirst police officer at London Bridge attack "was rugby player who took on all terrorists until forced to ground" A British Transport Police officer stabbed during the London terror incident took on the knifemen armed only with his baton, and has been praised for his bravery London Bridge terror attackLondon Bridge terrorist 'ringleader' was former Underground and KFC worker who tried to brainwash kids in local park The 27-year-old attacker, currently identified only as 'Abz', lived in Barking, East London with his wife and two young children London Bridge terror attackCommuters face chaos around London Bridge as terror attack investigation continues Police said cordons put in place while officers carry out investigation work would remain "well into Monday" London Bridge terror attackFamily of London Bridge terrorist killed by police say 'we just want to grieve in peace' The 27-year-old attacker, currently identified only as 'Abz', lived in Barking, East London with his wife and two young children TerrorismSecurity barriers installed at London bridges after terror attack killed seven and injured 48 Many have questioned why barriers weren't installed after the Westminster attack General election pollsUK general election 2017 poll tracker: All the latest results as Conservatives battle Labour Polls are a crucial part of the election wallchart - even if they've got a bad rep.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH  • Business •  Markets Money Real Estate Legal Corporate News One News Page > Business > Google Are Moving Home - And Its Design Is A Bit Of A Stretch Google Are Moving Home - And Its Design Is A Bit Of A Stretch Sunday, 4 June 2017 (9 hours ago) by Graham Pierrepoint Google are, of course, one of the world’s biggest and best-known brands, providing internet users with methods to search, use email and even browse the web in general – they really have eaten up the search engine market in a big way. This, of course, has meant that the company has needed to expand significantly over the years, with its base in Palo Alto serving as an HQ – and with several worldwide locations aiding those in need of their services elsewhere on the planet. Google’s UK base in London, for example, has been seen as something of a hub for some time – and, according to news this week, construction on a whole new HQ for the brand in the UK’s capital. That’s not all – the new building, set to start construction in 2018, is thought to be as long as the towering Shard, also in London, is tall – with The Independent referring to the intriguing design as something of a ‘landscraper’. The building, which has been submitted as a proposal this week, is being overseen by the same designers behind London 2012’s Olympic Cauldron – and it’s thought that it will not only play host to over 7000 staff, but will also incorporate a rooftop garden, several cafes, gyms and more besides – as the brand clearly intends to continue to treat its employees. Certainly, Google is a brand that many people state they wish to work for simply for their unorthodox approach towards offices – famously being the brand that allows staff to work from bean bags as opposed to traditional chairs and desks. The building will aim to make commuting easy, too – as it’s being lined up to run parallel to King’s Cross station. It’s thought that Google’s new base will be the first building that Google owns entirely beyond its US home – meaning that it’s clear the brand intends to stretch out into the UK as a second home, which may come as some solace to those concerned over jobs disappearing abroad due to the impending departure of the country from the European Union. Not one for following the crowd, it appears Google are keen to stand out even in the way their buildings are constructed – and we will have to see how well this new creation goes down in the years to come. 10 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Recent related news Apple likely to announce smart speaker next week to rival Amazon, GoogleApple Inc. is building an internet-connected home speaker, which it plans to announce publicly at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose next... bizjournals 3 days ago - Business It looks like Apple has some work to do if it wants Siri to be as smart as Google AssistantApple's next big developer conference starts Monday, and the hot rumor is that the company plans to launch its own smart speaker.

Here's a look at extremism on the web, what's being done to stop it and what could come next. Q. What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content doesn't spread across the internet? The Union flag flies at half mast in Whitehall, central London, Sunday June 4, 2017, after Saturday night's terrorist incident on London Bridge and at Borough Market. Several people were killed in the terror attack at the heart of London and dozens injured. Prime Minister Theresa May convened an emergency security cabinet session Sunday to deal with the crisis. (Stefan Rousseau/PA via AP) A. Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism. Google, for example, says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms. Google's YouTube service removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence, and its software prevents the video from ever being reposted. YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015; 1 percent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter teamed up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organizations. Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content. After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts. Twitter says in the last six months of 2016, it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of extremism. Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter's internal tools; just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests, the company says. Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone. It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the "friends" of an account that has been removed for terrorism. Q. Why are technology companies clashing with governments over extremist communications? A. Since Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance, several tech companies have started encrypting - that is, scrambling them to thwart spies - instant messages and other data so tightly that even the companies can't read them. Governments are not happy about that. After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted messages exchanged by extremists who carried out the attacks. Apple and Facebook's WhatsApp refused, noting that they didn't hold the keys needed to unscramble such messages. Both governments eventually found other ways to get the information they wanted. Some in government - including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California - have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security. Feinstein has introduced a bill to force companies to give the government so-called "backdoor" access to encrypted data so that investigators could read messages on these services. Q. Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A. Weakening encryption won't make people safer, says Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said. "It's playing whack-a-mole," he said. "The bad guys are not constrained by the law. That's why they're bad guys." Building backdoors into encryption could also weaken it in ways that hackers, criminals and foreign agents could exploit. That could potentially jeopardize all sorts of vital data, from personal communications and documents to bank accounts, credit card transactions, medical history and other information that people want to keep private. But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally, as in times of war. He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge. "If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy," he said. Q. Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A. Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission. In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda. "This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide," Zuckerberg said. But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough, since they need users in order to sell ads. "Think of the hateful stuff that is said. How do you draw the line? And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make," he said. Others say the focus on tech companies and their responsibilities is misplaced. Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago. Instead of working together to censor the internet, Anderson says, governments and companies should work together to share information more quickly. Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence. "The bottom line is that in too many places, in too many parts of the world, you've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have," Kerry said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."

It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 12:04pm PDTJun 4, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 81 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares225 Google Google Home News Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Source: Google Product Forums Tags assistant Google google home outage subscribe ...

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm glad I got an Echo instead of that air freshener. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e084adc03d0c0fe4e62615255f95376c0df7f936c6bd8c9b188e814dfa71c29.gif Luckbuckets I wanted to disagree with your choice of the echo but that gif. but the snark over the top. awesome. Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime.

You’re not alone Stephen Hall - Jun. 4th 2017 1:25 pm PT @hallstephenj Google Home View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit I’ve been noticing a weird issue with Google Home off and on for the last couple weeks, but it has become particularly annoying this weekend. Basically, the device has been interrupting many of my queries with “Sorry, something went wrong,” and then asks me to try again in a few seconds. At first I chalked it up to a random glitch on my end, but it seems it’s a bit more than that. If you’re experiencing this problem as well, just know that you’re not alone. Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! If you’ve been experiencing this annoyance, you know exactly what’s happening: You say “Okay Google,” and then before you even get a chance to ask your query, you’re interrupted with something along the lines of “Hmm, something went wrong” or “There was a glitch, try again in a few seconds.” It was sporadically happening over the last couple weeks for me, but now it’s become almost every time. I tweeted about it this morning, to which several people replied saying that they’re having the same exact problem. Also worth noting is that the Google Product Forum is currently filled with people mentioning it. Their accounts seem to line up pretty well with what I’ve dealt with, and presumably what many others are experiencing. Here’s one example: Out of nowhere Google Home began not responding and saying “having a problem, try back in a few seconds”.  Removing power and resetting does work for a couple commands, then back to same problem.  Have had no problem for 5 months, now send to be getting worse.  Same location, router fine, shows device on my network. Google says it’s aware of the issue and working to resolve it: We are aware of the issue. We appreciate your patience while we’re looking into it. To help us, please continue to file feedback via the Google Home app with the instructions below. Anyone else having problems with Google Home randomly saying "Sorry, something went wrong…" ? Happens like 25% of the time for me. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) June 4, 2017 Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google. Twitter DMs are open.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple wins Design Patents for Siri Icons in China and EU Confirming that Siri will Work with Future Smart Glasses | Main | While the State of VR Headsets is at a crawl today, the Market is set to Explode with Vitality later this Year » June 04, 2017 Samsung Patent Reveals Next-Gen Gear VR Headset with Multiple new Features, Major Accessories & Applications   The first generation of Gear VR was for the most part a rudimentary accessory for Galaxy smartphones that provided their users with the ability to play games or dabble in VR-like applications using a closed environment through a headset. In order to attract more consumers to this new product category, Samsung's Gear VR has to provide potential customers with a much wider range of features and applications. This week the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Samsung that reveals a future version of Gear VR that will deliver their first original set of features and new input accessories that will go a long way in helping to excite consumers to this new product class. Google is also about to update their VR headset as well.   Google's next version of Daydream will introduce a remote with an integrated touch pad to control onscreen activities and use head-tracking and head-motion for certain games and functions that they call 'WorldSense.' It will allow users move naturally in VR worlds. It's being developed with HTC VIVE and Lenovo. It's a next-gen standalone VR headset without needing to be tethered to a PC as noted in the video below.   Instead of introducing hand-held remote controllers like other headsets, Samsung set out to do something different by inventing a series of new input controllers for a wider range of applications.   All-New Gear VR Detachable Trackpad Accessory   Samsung's patent FIG. 1 noted above is an exploded view of a next-generation version of Gear VR illustrating a new face cover made of a clear glass substrate that will allow the Galaxy smartphone's backside camera to take photos of the outside world, allow users to see their immediate environment and it could provide users a PIP view within the headset as noted further in the full Patently Mobile report.    In this abbreviated Patently Apple report I'll only point to the first new input accessory for Gear VR and illustrate how the new headset design will accommodate photo-taking with a drone.   One of three new Gear VR input accessories noted below can be seen connecting to a Galaxy Smartphone via a USB connector. The accessory is designed to provide users with hands-free touch screen input that will work with applications and gaming menus so as to choose options, move and/or interact with an item or object.   In patent FIG. 6 you can partially see that the touch pad can be turned or folded so that the accessory could be optionally accessed at a different angle.   Panoramic and Drone Photography Applications   As noted in patent FIGS. 13A and 13B noted below we're able to see how taking a panoramic photo of a scene could be done hands free by simply clicking on that option on a Galaxy smartphone using the trackpad or wheel key input accessory and simply moving one's head. With the face plate of Gear VR shifting to a clear glass plate, the user is free to take photos with a single finger on their input accessory. The user is also likely to take a steadier panoramic or regular shot by not having to hold their smartphone. Of course the trade-off is that you'll look like a total nerd taking photos that way, but that's life.    Samsung also illustrates in the patent figures above that Gear VR will be able to work with future drone devices that could be controlled through the headset and various new input accessories.   Samsung filed their U.S. patent application back in October 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple wins Design Patents for Siri Icons in China and EU Confirming that Siri will Work with Future Smart Glasses" Apple's design patent and two utility patents published in 2017 have shown that Apple's headset will use Siri as a major method for controlling a future headset or smart glasses. Of course using a remote with a headset was first established by Apple back in 2010 and noted below in Apple's patent figure, so that will likely be a secondary input methodology.    You can tell that Apple is slowly preparing for smartglasses or a headset for Augmented and Virtual reality because even their updated Mac Pro trademark update coverage listed a connection to such a development by using key words and phrases such as "head mounted displays, headsets, augmented reality displays, goggles, controllers, 3D spectacles and smartglasses," in their international class 09 filing.     Apple isn't in a big rush to jump into smartglasses or a headset even though they have a dedicated team currently working on this project. The market is very young and nothing to date has excited the market to adopt this kind of device. Apple also wants to provide users with a top of the line user experience and user interface that will no doubt have to be somewhat reinvented for a headset. Apple is also known to introduce new apps with a new kind of device and so that takes time. A new report about the current state of VR is going to be posted later this afternoon, so stay tuned.   Patently Mobile presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 12:04pm PDTJun 4, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 81 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares225 Google Google Home News Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Source: Google Product Forums Tags assistant Google google home outage subscribe ...

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm glad I got an Echo instead of that air freshener. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e084adc03d0c0fe4e62615255f95376c0df7f936c6bd8c9b188e814dfa71c29.gif Luckbuckets I wanted to disagree with your choice of the echo but that gif. but the snark over the top. awesome. Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg For the first time in years, Apple Inc. will use its annual developer conference to tout not just its software, but hardware too. When the Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday in San Jose, California, the iPhone maker is likely to unveil iPads and Mac laptops along with new versions of the operating systems for those devices, according to people familiar with the plans. Cook may even lift the cover on a smart speaker based on the Siri virtual assistant. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up It will be the first time Apple has presented new hardware at the conference since 2013. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has for more than a year been showcasing the strength of Apple’s services businesses, such as the App Store and iCloud storage, in part a reflection of a dearth of new blockbuster gadgets and slowing growth for Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone. Now as the device pipeline fills, the company is shining more of the spotlight on hardware to woo the developers needed to create accompanying apps. The company will also try to win over programmers with updates to Apple’s operating systems for computers, mobile devices, Apple TV and Watch. “They’re there to spoil the developer community,” said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research. Debuting a smart speaker competitor to Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and the Google Home at WWDC would be a logical step, since it would give developers the tools to build apps for the device before its release later in the year.  “They may not be able to put enough information into the developer community without showing them the hardware too,” said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. “It will be part of a broader strategy that says these are devices that are interesting now and we need to let our customers know about them.” Amazon makes little or no profit selling the high-end $179 Echo, which mostly serves as a foothold in consumers’ homes and a way to get them to sign up for Amazon Prime and buy more products. Google Home, which sells for $129, is a window to Google’s plethora of services from Search to YouTube Red music streaming and its Calendar app.   It isn’t yet clear how much Apple will charge for its own smart speaker. But it may also be a play to boost the profitable services business, which last year generated revenue of more than $24 billion -- or 11 percent of total sales. There’s plenty of incentive for developers to get behind the new gadget. So far this year, they have reaped about $10 billion from the App Store. WWDC follows similar events held recently by Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. At those gatherings, the software giants sought to burnish their credentials in augmented reality and artificial intelligence. Like Google, Apple has been developing its own dedicated processor for AI, according to a person familiar with the plan. Analysts expect Apple to show off improvements to Siri and advances in AR technology as part of the iOS 11 mobile operating system, which will hint at features in the next iPhone to be introduced later this year. “AI will play a larger role with this release by leveraging enhanced capabilities around Siri,” Brian White, a Drexel Hamilton analyst, wrote in a note to clients. “Given our view that the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will come with 3D sensing technology, we expect some AR-related features to be integrated into iOS 11.” The updated operating system will also include the second revamp of the Apple Music streaming service in as many years. With the company planning as many as 10 original television series by the end of this year, the update will make video content far more prominent, Apple’s music guru Jimmy Iovine told Bloomberg in April. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

We have yet to see a widespread discount on the Chromecast Ultra since it was released last year, until today. Now you can pick one up for $10 off the normal price at several physical and online retailers. If you need a refresher, the Chromecast Ultra is a step up from the second-generation Chromecast, with support for 4K video playback. It can also play HDR/Dolby Vision content, as long as you have a compatible TV. The Ultra also ships with an Ethernet adapter, in case your wireless network isn't quite enough to stream that high quality video. You can find links to all the retailers selling the discounted Ultra below. Let us know in the comments if you spot any more stores discounting it. It's also worth mentioning that the 2nd gen Chromecast and the Chromecast Audio are both $5 off as well.

Garbage not even worth 5 bucks. I returned it and got my money back. You're better off with something else like a Roku or something. timpkmn89 Why do you say that? Chromecast is great. Diego Because people just love hating on Google products.. I've had a chromecast first gen and its worked great. Sure there's been some connection issues from time to time but what device is flawless? I've actually been thinking about upgrading and this seems to be a nice chance to.. bobinchicago I agree. I ended up giving mine to friends, who used it for a week and then gave up. I got a Nexus Player that is so much better. Chromecast is a clever hack but a real STB will win every time. (That said, I just got a projector so I can watch movies on my porch, and the Chromecast is probably a pretty good option for that, so I may do a lunchtime trip to Best Buy near my work tomorrow.) Lawrence PSA: chromecast is not a wireless HDMI. Chromecast content is limited. timpkmn89 And by "limited", you mean works with pretty much any streaming service. Zsolt V Yeah, that's exactly what he means. But he is a bit of an imbecile​, so it came out wrong. tim242 Chromecast is dead to me. I have two that have been rendered useless by an update. Why does Google keep fucking up its ability to work with phone hotspots? Zsolt V Why Google, why? 4Ui812 I'm guessing the pricing scheme has to do with the Dolby licensing. Because $60 bucks for a Chromecast is $50 to much.

June 4th, 2017 by Conner Flynn Advertisement Google is always looking for new technical talent. So teaching kids how to code makes sense. That is why the company announced that they’d teamed with Wonder Woman to inspire teen girls to learn coding. Made with Code is a Google initiative that encourages teen girls to pursue coding, and has released a new Wonder Woman-themed coding project. Players learn basic coding and logic skills by controlling three different scenes from the Wonder Woman film. You can use drag and drop blocks of code that make up actions, objects and variables.  These code blocks will help Wonder Woman overcome obstacles in her path and reach her goals. If you are new to coding this will help you see how the different aspects of code fit together to create a finished product. This is a great way to teach kids about coding in a fun way. I’m sure that many girls will enjoy this one.

India TV Entertainment Desk, New Delhi [Published on:04 Jun 2017, 4:32 PM IST] Comment Google dedicates Doodle to yesteryear Bollywood actress Nutan It was evident that millions of emotions were brought to life by this phenomenal actress we know as Nutan. Her expressive face and effortless acting skills are still not replaced by any other actor. On her 81st birthday, Google dedicated its Doodle to the deceased actress on Sunday. The two O’s of the Google were replaced by the beautiful actress in her few of many expressions. The actress did more than 70 films in her Bollywood career of about four decades.  "Today's Doodle reflects Nutan's expressive acting style on what would have been her 81st birthday. It was hard to sum up her genius in a single portrait, and so we depicted four distinct expressions," Google said in a statement. The image imitates her expressions as a conflicted murderess from "Bandini", the agonized untouchable from "Sujata", the hell-raising orphan from "Seema" -- all unforgettable characters played by Nutan, a celebrated Indian film actress known for communicating complex emotions using only facial expressions and body language rather than dialogue, the statement read. Her faces fill up for the "oo" in Google.An icon of Indian cinema for over four decades, Nutan pioneered powerful women-centric films in an age when male actors dominated the silver screen.Over her career, her distinct, groundbreaking style helped solidify an award-winning legacy. She was honoured with Padma Shri in 1974 for her contribution to the Arts and a total of six Filmfare Awards, five of which were for Best Actress.   Related Tags: NutanGoogle DoodleGoogle DoodlesBirth AnniversaryBirthday Write a comment From Our Network SOPOSTED 10 Fascinating Facts About Breasts That Even Women Don’t Know!!

[Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 24 Share on Facebook 24 Share on Twitter Total Shares59 Deals Google Home News The Google Home was the first (and currently only) smart speaker with Google Assistant, introduced at Google I/O 2016 and released near the end of last year. Since then it has gained support for nearly every major smart home product, and Google added multi-user functionality as well. If you've been waiting for a price drop to buy it, now's your chance - the Home is $109 almost everywhere it's sold. If you're completely unfamiliar with the Google Home, allow me to explain the basics. It's a smart speaker, much like Amazon's Echo, using Google Assistant. Once you set it up with the Home app, you can ask it questions, start playing music from a variety of services using voice commands, and even use it as a Google Cast speaker. We have added links to all the discounted Google Home listings below. If you see it on sale anywhere else, let us know in the comments.

And another one when Apple ships their smart speaker. I also want to see aggressive marketing this week from Google. Every time the Siri speaker is mentioned they need to make sure the Google Home is mentioned right along with it. Google cannot afford to rest on their laurels. Because no matter how much Siri sucks, Apple users will buy anything with an Apple logo on it. And they'll buy it in the millions of units in the first week of sales. Ryan If they fixed keep integration $109 would be a good price, but with that still broken its not worth it because that was one of the big features I used it for. I got mine for $75 when there was that sale with a credit for using a CC verification service, at that price it was a no brainer. Fix keep integration and add the intercom and we are talking, I would have been willing to pay the original price for a second one. But now I am nervous they are going to break more features in order to push some service (Google Express is their excuse for breaking Keep) I dont want. I'm not paying for a device to be locked into a shopping service arbitrarily. Since Google has shown that is what they are willing to do Im holding off. And this is coming from someone with a smartthings controller, which adds value. Without that its nothing more than a google search box and music player, which makes it even less valuable. Llama Everyone should probably be warned that the latest update rendered Google Homes unusable. Buyer Beware. Corbin Davenport What do you mean? My Home is working fine. dullknives same here and on the latest firmware - 88047. Llama Check out r/googlehome. Many users have been receiving "something went wrong" for 90% of requests ever since 88047 went live on Friday. Corbin Davenport Yikes. NooSH you upvoted your own comment, what an idiot.. stop spewing crap,most google home users (outside of reddit) are fine on the latest firmware. Llama That's why AP made an article about it an hour ago? 😘 nasa25 I don't think so bud. My GH has been a paperweight since 88047 rolled out on Friday dariusmoss i'm one of the people having issues.. :( surethom As a speaker it has terrible sound compared to the Amazon echo, way too much base. Come on Google release a graphical equaliser so WE can alter the sound quality. Swami FYI, HSN has the Google Home for the same price too ($109) plus they have $20 off of any $40+ purchase if paid with Visa Checkout. Brings down to $89 + $5 for shipping..

The Nest Cam IQ, unveiled Wednesday, will be Nest's first device to draw upon the same human-like skills that Google has been programming into its computers — for instance, to identify people in images via its widely used photo app. Facebook deploys similar technology to automatically recognize and recommend tags of people in photos posted on its social network. Nest can tap into Google's expertise in artificial intelligence because both companies are owned by the same parent company, Alphabet Inc. With the new feature, you could program the camera to recognize a child, friend or neighbor, after which it will send you notifications about that person being in the home. Nest isn't saying much about other potential uses down the road, though one can imagine the camera recognizing when grandparents are visiting and notifying Nest's internet-connected thermostat to adjust the temperature to what they prefer. Or it might be trained to keep a close eye on the kids when they are home after school to monitor their activities and send alerts when they're doing something besides a list of approved activities. The cost of facial recognition The new camera will begin shipping in late June for almost $300. You'll also have to pay $10 a month for a plan that includes facial recognition technology. The same plan will also include other features, such as alerts generated by particular sounds — barking dogs, say — that occur out of the camera's visual range. The camera will only identify people you select through Nest's app for iPhones and Android devices. It won't try to recognize anyone that an owner hasn't tagged. Even if a Nest Cam IQ video spies a burglar in a home, law enforcement officials will have to identify the suspect through their own investigation and analysis, according to Nest. Privacy concerns Facial recognition is becoming more common on home-security cameras. Netatmo , for instance, introduced a security camera touting a similar facial recognition system in 2015. That camera sells for about $200, or $100 less than the Nest Cam IQ. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. The way that the Nest and Netatmo cameras are being used doesn't raise serious privacy concerns because they are only verifying familiar faces, not those of complete strangers, said Jennifer Lynch, who specializes in biometrics as a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital advocacy group. But Lynch believes privacy issues are bound to crop up as the resolution and zoom capabilities of home security cameras improve, and as engineers develop more sophisticated ways of identifying people even when an image is moving or only a part of a face is visible. Storing home-security videos in remote data centers also raises security concerns about the imagery being stolen by computer hackers. "It definitely could become a slippery slope," Lynch said. The privacy issues already are thorny enough that Nest decided against offering the facial recognition technology in Illinois, where state law forbids the collection and retention of an individual's biometric information without prior notification and written permission. Further details Nest's $10-a-month subscription includes video storage for 10 days. Video can be stored up to 30 days with an upgrade to a subscription plan costing $30 per month. The high-end camera supplements lower-resolution indoor and outdoor cameras that Nest will continue to sell for almost $200. Neither of the lower-end cameras is equipped for facial recognition.

Muslim quarters. April 12, 2017 Image Credit: mtsyri / Shutterstock.com At times, the most ordinary of occurrences leaves a lasting impact. Such was the case when a student, by simply arriving late to an event, transformed how Google, and I, understand the politics of tech in Israel and Palestine. As Google’s Director of New Business Development at the time, I was hosting a hackathon for 800 software developers in Tel Aviv. Mohammad, a Palestinian student from Ramallah, showed up three hours late. He apologetically explained that he and his seven friends were detained at an Israeli checkpoint. Of the eight, only he was allowed to pass. In that moment I realized that, just by the location of our event, we at Google had effectively chosen sides without meaning to. That was nearly 10 years ago. Last week, as I found myself in Gaza participating in the AngelHack Global Hackathon Series hosted by Gaza Sky Geeks, I had cause to reflect on the progress we in the tech industry have made on this front and what work still remains to be done. In the tech sector we often seek to avoid politics, and Israel and Palestine is perhaps the most political matter of all. Yet with activism by tech CEOs on the rise, the landscape is changing, and it has become increasingly untenable for leaders not to take a stand. Even attempts to adhere to the status quo can inadvertently work to deepen inequalities. For example, PayPal is offered to Israeli citizens, including those living in settlements in the occupied West Bank, but is not offered to Palestinians living on the same land. Airbnb lists properties in those settlements as being inside Israel. Palestinian areas are not only missing from maps on Waze, but should one approach a Palestinian town, Waze alerts you to “avoid dangerous areas.” I don’t think these errors are on purpose. In fact, I know they aren’t, because I made the same mistake. My realization, courtesy of Mohammad’s experience, kicked off a years-long effort by Google to ensure both Israel and Palestine were treated as equally as possible. We did this by launching a Palestinian domain, ensuring “Palestine” was a location on product offerings, and investing in a Palestinian venture capital fund in the West Bank and a startup accelerator in Gaza. Yet they’re not perfect. I recently noticed “Palestine” was not in the list of countries for YouTube sign-ups. Decisions made in tech often have political consequences, even if that decision is to stay above the fray. Because if the fray is one of inequality, refusing to address it only leads us to replicate it in our work. We must take care not to do this, as it goes against what we stand for and, in Silicon Valley, what we stand for has scalable impact. With a stagnant peace process, and much talk and little action from President Trump, the reality is that for the foreseeable future, Israel will continue to control territory inhabited by 6.5 million Jews and 6.5 million Christian and Muslim Palestinians. Therefore, in our business dealings, we must recognize all of Israel and Palestine as being territory controlled by one authority and ensure we are not directly or indirectly discriminating against anyone in that territory because of their ethnic or religious identity. Now more than ever we need to reconsider our response to these issues. Since Trump’s election, many of us feel called to identify and promote our values. We are proud the tech sector has so often stood firmly on the side of diversity, democracy, and dignity for all. We must work to ensure those values are extended to our business dealings around the world, including in Israel and Palestine, where we can make a difference. Palestinian economic stagnation – Gaza’s unemployment rate is the highest in the world – is a major contributor to the increasing despair of Palestinians. As Palestinian movement and access to resources such as water and land is restricted, tech is one of the few sectors capable of growing as it requires few physical inputs. With our knowledge and resources, Silicon Valley can work to remove obstacles to Palestinian entrepreneurship, strengthen the Palestinian tech sector, and contribute to Palestinian employment and the prospects for a sustainable peace. Tech has a remarkable ability to transcend borders, and several companies have already been engaging with the Palestinian tech sector. Cisco and Microsoft outsource to the West Bank, while Google, Techstars Foundation, and GitHub offer funding to Palestinian entrepreneurs. In my previous experience at Google, fears that such moves would alienate our Israeli colleagues were pleasantly disproven. Due to Israel’s prominence in the field, tech companies often have easier access to Israeli perspectives than Palestinian ones. Silicon Valley needs to prioritize getting information from Palestinians when making decisions that affect Palestinians. One simple act to facilitate this is to go to Palestine during regular business trips to Israel. Tech leaders like Dave McClure (500 Startups), Patrick Collison (Stripe), and Craig Newmark (Craigslist) all make a point of visiting Palestine when they travel for work to Israel. Recently, several technologists and venture capitalists formed a working group to support Palestinian tech initiatives. Its aim is to assist both Palestinian entrepreneurs in connecting with Silicon Valley and tech companies here in learning how to navigate the region. In meeting with and observing the participants of last week’s hackathon in Gaza, I see tremendous potential yearning to be unleashed. As believers in entrepreneurship, we aspire to a world where every young person has the tools to put their ideas into action.

The digital-ad giant’s announcement comes as hundreds of millions of Internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and cellphones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten Web sites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google’s version would allow ads as long as Web sites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that do not go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. The feature would be turned on by default, and users can turn it off, Google said, adding that it would work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Even ads it sells would be blocked on Web sites that do not get rid of annoying types of ads, Google said. However, there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser’s efforts. It is a “small number of Web sites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences,” Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. “I’m sure there are some publishers who will get hurt,” Pivotal Research Group ad analyst Brian Wieser said. However, in the long term, cracking down on irritating ads should make the Internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links, he said. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual Web sites have come up with their own countermeasures. For example, Forbes.com will not let users read stories without disabling their ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts so the site can track you. Google would work with Web sites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It is to take a 10 percent cut of those payments. Facebook is also trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users by trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with “little substantive content” and “disruptive, shocking or malicious ads,” the company said.

X How to . . . use your phone to find your car Google and Apple both have handy ways to track down your vehicle via your smartphone about 13 hours ago Ciara O'Brien         We’ve all been there: parked the car and come back to find we don’t have the right spot. There’s the inevitable panic as you try to figure out if your car has been misplaced, towed or stolen, hitting fever pitch just as you find it three rows away from where you thought it was. There was an incident once that involved 15 minutes searching the long term car park at the airport before I finally gave in and asked for help from staff. But as you’d expect, there’s an app for that, or at least a function built into the mapping apps you more than likely already use. If you are using Car Play, Apple’s in-car system, or your car’s built in Bluetooth, iOS 10 will automatically mark your car as “parked” when you disconnect from the system. A small notification pops up on the screen letting you know that your car has been marked as parked, and if you need to, you can get directions back to your car in a couple of taps. Boylesports founder likely to pick successor from within family CarTrawler looks set to be sold a third time The Irish space sector, like space itself, is expanding If you want to disable the feature that automatically marks your parking location in iOS 10, got to Settings>Maps and scroll down to Your Car. Switch Show your Parking Location to on. Google’s attempt was built into Android devices, with the Google App automatically generating a card when you stopped your vehicle that showed your approximate location on a map. To enable this, you simply opened the Google app, tapped Menu>Customise>Transportation>How do you usually commute? and select Driving. The card then automatically generated in future. But what if you don’t have Car Play or Bluetooth in your vehicle, or an Android phone? Or if you are using Google Maps? That’s no problem: you can manually mark your car as parked on both Apple Maps and Google Maps. On Apple Maps, tap your location marker on the map and select Mark My Location. You can then get directions back to that location the next time you open Apple Maps. Google Maps added a feature in recent months that will let you mark your parking location manually. First, check that it’s enabled. Open the Google Maps app, and tap on the menu tab. Go to Navigation Settings, and check that Save Parking Location is switched on. Once that is enabled, to mark your car’s location all you need to do is tap on your current location marker on the map. From the pop up menu, choose Set as Parking Location. Google Maps will then save the location for 24 hours. No more lost cars or traipsing around a labyrinthine car park for hours as the panic rises.       Topics: Apple Google Read More Draper Esprit raises €115m to tap Brexit opportunities Dash gets Pro upgrade, encourages you to ditch the smartphone CoderDojo to merge with makers of €5 computer Eir chairman Padraig McManus to step down later this year Good news for people who smash their smart phones Breastfeeding assistance system scoops prize for start-up  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services No order from DPP to resume inquiry into Anglo auditors Work Wake-up call: Learn to dive into those tough talks Gaelic Football Resurgent Banner back in business and Munster final Innovation Ormeau Baths reopens as tech start-up co-working hub Sponsored Impact of cyber threats on business set to increase Dublin Airport Central: Ireland’s next generation business destination at Terminal 2 Beauty with attitude: changing the conversation about ageing The Story of Home: a potter’s life Latest Business AIB delays bail-in rules overhaul as IPO nears 06:00 Ormeau Baths reopens as tech start-up co-working hub 05:45 Cork-based Thalman Health seeks $2m to fund wearable tech 05:10 Red-tape forces property agent to drop small-time landlords 05:00 Boylesports founder likely to pick successor from within family 05:00 How to?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Qualcomm spells out the hurdles to ‘extended reality’ glasses Dean Takahashi@deantak June 4, 2017 8:35 AM Above: Augmented reality and virtual reality will be useful beyond games. Image Credit: Qualcomm Qualcomm wants virtual reality and augmented reality to succeed more than anyone, since it will supply the chips that power the hardware behind “extended reality,” delivered by ordinary-looking glasses that can deliver either virtual reality or augmented reality applications. But Tim Leland, vice president of product management at Qualcomm, gave a talk this week at Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara, Calif., where all the major tech companies — Google, Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft — and many others had augmented reality technology on display. He said there are plenty of obstacles to extended reality, and the industry should collectively work on the problems to bring the future into focus faster. He said that AR animations, overlaid on the real world, still look fake. For instance, if AR objects are inserted into the real world but they don’t cast shadows, then they clearly won’t fit seamlessly in the landscape. But enabling accurate lighting and shadows will require a lot more horsepower, and that will tax battery life. Leland laid out all of the problems in his talk, and he showed what kind of hardware the future will require. We talked about the challenges in an interview. Here’s an edited transcript of our talk. Above: Tim Leland of Qualcomm talks about extended reality. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: What kind of outlook do you have for mixed reality, extended reality? Tim Leland: We’ve hit a milestone. We mentioned we were building Snapdragon 835 VR HMD dev kits with full tool support. We’re bringing those up right now. We’re still on schedule to ship out to developers. We’ll go wide with that program this summer. We’re still executing on our HMD accelerator program. We have all these reference designs available for OEMs if they want to build an HMD based on Snapdragon 835. As far as AR, we’re going full speed ahead. ODG has been a great partner to us. The first time we’d ever done an announcement of a new flagship product with a non-smartphone customer was ODG here, at CES. That was a vote of confidence. We believe in their technology. We believe in AR. At this event I’m going to be presenting on what we’re calling extended reality, or XR. It’s an umbrella term to encapsulate VR, AR, and MR. It’s everything. Where we see things going in the future is a converged device that does all of it. It can do VR, with a display that goes completely opaque for that. It can do AR in the same mass-market consumer device. Six degrees of freedom. Inside out tracking for all the head movement. Support for more advanced use cases in eye tracking, and also hand tracking. Looking further down the road, we have this partnership with Leap Motion. Their technology makes VR much more fun and easy to use. We’ll continue to work with them, accelerating some of their algorithms in our heterogeneous compute units inside of Snapdragon to get even better performance. We’re still working with SMI on the eye tracking side. We have a lot of good partnerships on the algorithmic development of the computer vision aspects of AR and VR. We’ll keep pushing those, especially now that we have these dev kits. We’ll have a great platform to continue to refine some of these algorithms with partners. GamesBeat: Where are you making progress? Leland: I don’t know if you were at Google I/O, but there was the announcement there. We’ve been working with Google. There were multiple Daydream smartphone announcements, and two HMDs were announced. One was Lenovo and the other was HTC. I can’t go into too many details on what we’re doing with Google, but we’re very close partners on different form factors of VR devices. Also, we’re working with some unannounced partners on very influential HMD designs going forward. All of which we believe will ship at the end of the year or early next year, with new products on our side being announced toward the end of the year as well. We’ve been very busy on SDKs, to make sure we have better development tools. We’ve been refining our six degrees of freedom head motion tracking algorithm, so it works with binocular cameras instead of just a mono camera. It’s even more accurate and uses lower power. For the rest of the presentation I’ll introduce a few problems that I think the ecosystem needs to solve together. There will be areas where all these companies compete, but there are common areas where we should be working to solve some difficult problems. One of those areas I have broken out into five pieces here. If you have a virtual object that you’re placing in the real world, you might draw it correctly. It might be anchored correctly. But if it’s not lit correctly, it’s still going to look fake. If you look at the top one here, that’s the same model as the bottom one, but the bottom is using the real light as the light source. That’s an area where we’ll be working on all aspects of foveation, whether it’s for standardizing and improving foveated graphics rendering to improve visual quality at lower power consumption, and also foveation of video, the view portal for adaptive streaming. When the upstream video service knows you’ve turned your head, it’ll then start refocusing the bitrate to that part of the environment map so you get the best visual quality with reductions in power consumption. It’s a lot of stuff. This is a brand new market and a huge amount of work. The smartphone could eventually become a large segment of the market in XR wearables. There will be no cables in this type of market. Any type of cable is just a non-starter. Fans will not exist. We think there might be a niche market for glasses that maybe stream to a PC, but that’s a small part of it. The big part is everything self-contained in a mobile device. All the visual processing systems are very close to the inertial sampling systems, so everything is very fast, very low motion to photon latency, or for AR very low photon to photon latency. We’ll just have to solve some of the power problems together with the ecosystem. I list some of those in the presentation. Above: Qualcomm’s vision for the “extended reality” glasses of the future. Image Credit: Qualcomm VB: The lighting issue seems like a big problem, how to make things look real. But then you have to know where the lighting is in the real world. You have to sense that somehow. Leland: It’s a worthy problem for a company that spends a lot of time on visual processing like we do. We’ll be working with middleware companies. I’ve talked to a couple already, operating system guys. At events like this sometimes we just like to throw out one of the difficult problems that we think is worth solving. It gets the debate started. Those that are willing to jump in with us and do some joint R&D sometimes—that’s how we get things moving forward. VB: Are you guys making any predictions as far as how soon things will happen? Leland: I really do think the analogy to smartphones is a good one. Unfortunately it’s been copied so much, but we came up with this first slide maybe two years ago. We’ve been updating it over time. If you think of this as a 30-year cycle, for phones this would have been about 1987. We’re somewhere in the ‘90s in this analogy. By 2020, somewhere in that time, we think we will enter this phase of the technology – rapid evolution, surging consumer adoption – as these devices become more socially acceptable. They’ll be smaller. They’ll work better. The content is coming. That’ll be the steep part of the hockey stick, where we keep marching along the next 15-20 years after that. There’s still money to be made along the way. There will be volumes in here. But out in this time frame we’re talking hundreds of millions of units per year. We think that’s possible. It’s especially possible if you bring different experiences to the same device, more value to the same device, which is sub-$1,000. It can do VR and AR. It doesn’t require a lot of setup. It just works. It’s awesome to see Facebook put a bunch of effort into what they’re building. Google is doing a great job of funding content for VR. They just acquired a company we invested in, Owlchemy. That was a good acquisition on their side. All arrows are pointing in the direction that mobile is the future and convergence is happening. That’s how we see the world right now. Above: All the sensors for extended reality glasses. Image Credit: Qualcomm VB: Do you have a splintering as well, when you get to other kinds of devices that could happen once the tech was better? Leland: Even within HMDs—there will be HMDs that are specific to different types of jobs or tasks. They could be purpose built for a particular job. We go through an example in here about a first responder, a firefighter. It shows what that might look like. We had an early mockup of this for the New York event and we’ve been refining it. You wouldn’t imagine that you’d just wear these glasses around, but if it was a mission critical part of your job, something that made your job easier and safer, you might. But the mass market will be glasses that look more like what we wear around anyway. Maybe a bit bigger and heavier, but it can’t be too much. This is the kind of thing where people decide that they don’t need a smartphone. They can just get these glasses. Much like people started deciding they didn’t need a laptop when they could do everything on their phone. Not everybody did that, but a big swathe of consumers did. That may be the case as mobile evolves and changes form factor. Above: The can without a shadow doesn’t look real. Image Credit: Qualcomm VB: On the game side, are you envisioning anything in particular? Leland: It’ll be interesting to see where AR gaming goes. It’s been around a while. I got a Nintendo 3DS a while ago, and that was fun. As the ability to more appropriately place and draw and light virtual objects in real-world settings—it could be a lot of fun for kids too. You don’t have to get out all these different board games. Put on the glasses, load a program, there it is. The game is all set up right in front of you. You can movie pieces and draw cards. We might even see a revival of the old games we used to play as kids. Now it’s just an augmented version. For VR there’s going to be—all the PC and console games will probably be rejigged for VR. Part of the market will go crazy for that. We make an SDK. We have a team that supports game developers. We’re working with Tencent. We’re pretty active in the gaming space. There’s another big publisher over in China that we can’t talk about yet, but we’re working with them. We’re very closely partnered with Unity to make sure that engine – which is the foundation of almost every VR game in development, it feels like – is well-optimized for Snapdragon. Above: Augmented reality looks fake today. Image Credit: Qualcomm VB: In that 30-year cycle, where do you see something like 5G coming into it? It seems to make it much more useful. Leland: It sure does. Where that will come into play is most likely for video. If you look where we are today, 4K Ultra HD, 30fps, 360 degrees. We’re probably not completely there. It’s just starting to come online for broadcast video and streaming from other services. In the next decade, though, it’s going to go crazy. It’ll be 8K, up to 120fps, all high dynamic range. We’ll have the concept of the free viewpoint, where all the video has been captured from multiple angles, so it’s almost like computer graphics. You can walk around and interact with video. The major sports franchises are very interested in this part. This is going to require multiple gigabits per second. Importantly, because this is interactive, you want low latency. With 5G we’re improving the latency, the responsiveness with other applications, by 10 times. It’s down to a millisecond. The other important thing is, you don’t have to stand right next to the cell tower to get that. The 5G experience is much more uniform as you’re walking away from the cell tower. You don’t see the same kind of reduction in throughput and latency. Above: This is how real augmented reality should look. Image Credit: Qualcomm VB: It also seems to have the effect of lightening up the glasses, if you don’t need as much processing or hardware in them. Leland: For video, that’s more latency-tolerant. The video content will be from Netflix, YouTube, somebody else’s server connected to their drones, somebody else’s glasses. But for graphics, we believe most of that will be rendered on the device. Graphics is more latency-intolerant. Outside of the view frustum, nothing exists in graphics. You wouldn’t do that. You wouldn’t burn unnecessary power. But for video you’re taking a scene and wrapping it around a sphere or a rectangular projection. The benefit of this interaction latency—even if you can’t interact with the video, if you have lower latency as you turn your head, you can alert the system that’s streaming to you. “Okay, focus the highest bitrate on this part of the video for the best visual quality.” That’s called viewport aware adaptive streaming. Google is investing big on that, and others as well. There’s going to be a mix of a lot of processing, particularly visual processing, in the HMD itself, but you want to have high connectivity over 5G to these internet services for the stuff that’s less latency-intolerant. It’s going to be killer. XR video is going to be the killer application for 5G. VB: What do you think is the answer once people get to a point where they can’t necessarily tell what’s real and what’s not? Leland: I do think it’s going to happen. “When?” is a good question. Part of that depends on the viewer. If you’re like me and you do this every day and you know what flaws to look for, we may be the guys who take longer. For the average consumer, though, when do they say it’s just like real life? I don’t know. It won’t be for a few more years. Sometime in the middle of the next decade, maybe, we could get to a point where quite a few applications are indistinguishable from reality. Above: Qualcomm believes extended reality will unfold over decades. Image Credit: Qualcomm VB: Tony Parisi of Unity was saying, “If you think we have a problem with fake news now, wait until you can actually fake what people see.” Leland: [laughs] We’re swimming in the same direction as Tony. We’re pretty closely partnered with those guys. We have a common view of the world. It’s moving toward mobile. The different markets that graphics could service within VR are pretty immense. I don’t think a week goes by that we’re not talking to Unity in some fashion. We’re pretty heavily engaged with them, just like Google and other similar companies. VB: Any other key conclusions in your talk? Leland: These problems we’re talking about, there is no one company that can solve them. There’s no half a dozen companies. They’re not even just hardware problems. Even on power consumption, there’s a software element. There are times when we’ll compete with different companies, but there’s a lot of room to come together. It’s time we start agreeing on some of the goalposts for these difficult problems. Like field of view – do we go after more than 190 degrees? Do we just stick with 190 degrees on the horizontal but optimize the heck out of everything in the middle? It’s time for the industry to start agreeing on the fundamentals as best we can. We can still compete in areas where we agree, but if we don’t start working together it’s going to stagnate the evolution of these high-volume devices that are waiting out there. Make products that consumers want to buy and they’ll want to buy them. Volumes will go up. If we just try to repurpose old PC era antiquated architectures and create a market out of what we have, don’t be surprised when consumers don’t react and you have this gap of disappointment. We’re focused on trying to make products with our partners that consumers want to buy. We’re focusing on some of these problems and we’re eventually going to fix them. Above: The vision for extended reality. Image Credit: Qualcomm VB: I could see definite problems in the input systems. There’s going to be so many ways to do input. Whether or not you’ll have touch feedback or detect one finger or detect all 10 fingers– Leland: Our take on that—in the near term there are six degrees of freedom controllers that are ramping up at various stages. There’s some nice consortium activity going on in the open XR community at Khronos to standardize the APIs that those different controllers will work with, so there’s not this fragmentation problem for developers. But in the long term, as we’ve been saying, the best controller is no controller, using computer vision and machine learning technologies to predict and interpret gestures rapidly. For VR, using 3D reconstruction bring your own hands overlaying these models that are being used in VR, so it looks like—it’s even more immersive. VB: Does that then create a new problem, though, where you can’t feel it? Leland: There will probably be some accessories related to the tactile aspect. I’m hearing about people working on smells as well. A lot of companies are working on sound-related technologies that you could relate to haptic feedback. A year ago the ability to move and see your hands seemed impossible, but now that’s normal in the virtual environment. VB: Does anything seem like it’s going to be too difficult? I get that feeling about eye tracking, whether you can control things with your eyes. Leland: It feels like it’s more of a complementary technology. You’d have certain interfaces that would not completely rely on eye tracking to complete the entire interaction. It would be more assistive. I’m looking around a room, it’ll keep track of where I’m looking. Therefore, if I just put out my hand, it knows I’m looking at the door handle over there. It simplifies that interaction, but it doesn’t rely solely on gaze. The eye tracking complements the body and hand motion tracking and interaction.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Google Artificial Intelligence Finally Beats the Best in "Go" -- What's Next? The AIphaGo AI computer defeated the best human Go player in the world, but this is more than just fun and games -- investors stand to gain from the real world applications. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Jun 4, 2017 at 10:53AM The 2,500 year-old Chinese game of Go, widely considered one of the most difficult and sophisticated board games in existence, was one of the last remaining games a computer had not yet mastered. The number of potential moves possible on the 19-by-19 grid exceeds the number of atoms in the entire universe.  Two opponents -- black and white -- alternate play by placing their pieces, also called stones, on the grid. The object of the game is to capture the most spaces. Each player attempts to surround the pieces of his or her opponent to remove those pieces from the board and control the most territory. At the end of play, the opponent with the greatest number of spaces wins. The Chinese game of Go is one of the most simple yet complex games in the world. Image source: Getty Images. DeepMind, a division of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, had its sights set on conquering the game, using its artificial-intelligence (AI) computer AlphaGo in the age-old battle of man vs. machine. The end of an era Last year, in a best-of-three series, AlphaGo deated 19 year-old prodigy Ke Jie, the world's top-ranked Go player. This was a battle of titans, and Google's own engineers reported: "According to AlphaGo's estimation of the match, the programme assessed the first 50 moves as virtually perfect, and the first 100 moves were the finest anyone has ever played against the Master version of AlphaGo."  Google acquired AI start-up DeepMind in 2014 for an estimated $660 million, and this competition was the most recent in a series of human vs. AI matchups in the centuries-old game that began several years earlier. At the time, it was unthinkable that a computer could defeat a human competitor in such a profoundly complex game. Every previous attempt to design a computer system that could beat humans came up short. That was before artificial intelligence. AlphaGo consists of two AI-based deep neural networks, each a combination of software and algorithms that are modeled after the structure of the human brain and each with a specific task. The first was charged with narrowing down the nearly infinite number of moves to those that had the greatest likelihood of being played. The second analyzed those moves to determine which will most likely lead to a winning game.  Deep Mind isn't only about fun and games. Image source: DeepMind.  Fun and games with real-world applications DeepMind is currently focused more on AI research and less on business applications, but that isn't to say Google doesn't benefit financially from it. One unexpected example came to light last year, when the company revealed that by using deep learning, a specific discipline of AI, it was able to improve the energy efficiency of its data centers. Similar to how a laptop generates heat, data centers produce heat on a much larger scale that must be mitigated or reduced, producing enormous cooling costs. By training the AI in the various operating scenarios, historical data, and average energy consumption, the system devised a method of alternating and optimizing the cooling system that achieved a 40% reduction in the amount of energy used for cooling. This achievement reduced the amount of energy the data centers used by a whopping 15%. That's significant when you consider that Google accounts for 0.01% of all global electricity use.  Another example of the financial benefits of AI, also from last year, came when Google developed a specialized computer chip called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). This chip was able to outperform standard chips by being 30 to 80 times more efficient. These efficiency gains were so profound that it saved Google from having to build a dozen new data centers, nearly doubling its current footprint. Google just released the latest version of its TPU, which will handle both the training of AI systems and running them once they're trained. It plans to make this technology available for free to researchers who share their results in peer-reviewed publications. Google also plans to make the upgraded technology available to customers through its Google Cloud. Investors still win It may sometimes be difficult for investors to wrap their minds around the ways in which a company like Google will financially benefit from AI. Keep in mind, however, that Google has a track record of using these algorithms to solve real-world problems, and while they may be difficult to quantify, investors stand to benefit nonetheless. We don't yet know what the next killer app will be, but Google and DeepMind believe that by focusing on the science, the financial gains will come -- and so far, they've been right.

The problem, as those companies (actually only two: Google owns YouTube, and Facebook owns WhatsApp) are discovering, is that politicians aren’t too picky about the distinction. Speaking outside 10 Downing St this morning, Theresa May was much more aggressive in her tone than previously. The London Bridge attack had its roots in Islamic extremism, she observed: “We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. Yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide internet-based services, provide.” She continued: “We need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremism and terrorism planning.” Which goes to show that when you need a scapegoat, the internet will always be there, as will big internet companies. The latter are by now becoming familiar with the process: there is an attack; the dots are joined to show how their services were used for tuition and/or planning; governments demand “action”; the companies improve their methods for removing extremist content; and we await the next cycle. But nothing substantive is different. The question is whether it ever can be. Germany is seeking a law which brings in hefty fines for being too slow to remove hate speech. But that isn’t the same as preventing it, or stopping planning. Play Video 6:26 Theresa May responds to ‘brutal terrorist attack’ in London “The kneejerk ‘blame the internet’ that comes after every act of terrorism is so blatant as to be embarrassing,” commented Paul Bernal, a law lecturer at the University of East Anglia who has worked with the police. The pressure, he says, comes from the politicians. For an example look no further than John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw since 2001, who this morning said: “I repeat, yet again, my call for the internet companies who terrorists have again used to communicate to be held legally liable for content.” Perhaps he has forgotten the 1970s, when in the pre-mobile phone era the IRA would use phones to organise its attacks – without anyone calling for (nor were there online social networks to “radicalise” would-be IRA members, but still they joined). The authoritarian sweep of Mann’s idea is chilling: since legal liability is meant to deter, the companies would need people to monitor every word you wrote, every video you watched, and compare it against some manual of dissent. It’s like a playbook for the dystopia of Gilead, in The Handmaid’s Tale (which, weirdly enough, most resembles Islamic State’s framework for living). The problem is this: things can be done, but they open a Pandora’s box. The British government could insist that the identities of people who search for certain terror-related words on Google or YouTube or Facebook be handed over. But then what’s to stop the Turkish government, or embassy, demanding the same about Kurdish people searching on “dangerous” topics? The home secretary, Amber Rudd, could insist that WhatsApp hand over the names and details of every communicant with a phone number. But then what happens in Iran or Saudi Arabia? What’s the calculus of our freedom against others’? Similarly, May and Rudd and every home secretary back to Jack Straw keep being told that encryption (as used in WhatsApp particularly) can’t be repealed, because it’s mathematics, not material. People can write apps whose messages can’t be read in transit, only at the ends. Ban WhatsApp, and would-be terrorists will find another app, as will those struggling against dictators. It’s true that the internet companies’ business models, of selling adverts against your attention, means they never had an incentive to be careful about what gets on to their platforms. We’re living with the unintended consequences. Yet speaking to people in those companies, one still hears enormous resistance to the idea of pre-filtering. It’s instead becoming an article of faith that “artificial intelligence” or “machine learning” will learn to spot this stuff and act. That’s far from proven, however. These companies are struggling with a problem they made that dwarfs their present capabilities. So what can be done? It might seem obvious, but while (to quote a famous hacker) “You cannot arrest an idea”, you can certainly stifle its attractiveness. Driving Isis out of Mosul and into the desert will cut its funding and its voice. Not helping countries that help jihadi groups would be smart too. Theresa May mentioned working with “allied democratic governments”. But it’s really the undemocratic ones – Saudi Arabia, for example – where one might start work. Ideas fade. The internet, though, isn’t going anywhere.

Google's 'Trusted Voice' feature keeps turning off for some users Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/01/08 11:18am PDTJan 8, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 94 Share on Twitter Total Shares192 Applications Google News The OK Google command is great, but I think we'd all agree that it can be a little... temperamental at times. Our Glorious Leader Artem recently took to Google+ to air his grievances about Trusted Voice, the feature that recognizes your voice and unlocks your phone accordingly. What happens when Trusted Voice is off. Specifically, Artem was complaining about Trusted Voice automatically, and seemingly randomly, turning itself off. This is annoying because it means when asking Google Assistant, or Voice Search on non-Pixel phones, the phone has to be manually unlocked before it answers.   Left: as you can see, Trusted Voice is off. Right: the Trusted Voice setup phase. This may be a bug limited to the Google app v6.10 beta, but I've found it happens with versions prior to that on my Nexus 6P. I'll set Trusted Voice up, and it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month - but then one day I'll ask it to play some music or set a timer and it'll say 'I can't do that as your phone needs to be unlocked' or something similar. Rinse and repeat. If Google wants to be the leader in the voice assistant market, it's crucial Assistant works as intended. This means improving the reliability of the OK Google command and ensuring it works 100% of the time. We'd be interested to hear your comments on this, and see if it's related to specific phones or versions of the Google app. Let us know in the comments!

Randomly works at times and other times it simply doesn't. mbarna I've been experiencing this bug on a Nexus 5x throughout the summer of 2016. Haven't seen it crop up recently though. Gonzales It happens on my 5X as well. I was chalking it up to Action Launcher 3 but it still happens with no launcher active. Very frustrating Van_Hammersly Same here. Nexus 5X. Although it happened on Nexus 5 and previous phones as well. Always took a reinstall. Artem Russakovskii Your GIF at least shows the voice prompt and then the lock. With Assistant, you just see the lock, and the voice prompt only shows up after you unlock, which... well, is just as frustrating. Chris Ledbetter Mine on my pixel will show a message saying i have to unlock the device and the prompt is no longer up forcing me to do it all over again. SMH Not a big deal, just something that should be flawless from a search giant... The Fink it happens on Samsung phones as well. Arie Yup, this is happening to me for quite a while.. Nexus 6P, on 7.1.1 blassster This has happened to me before as well, most recently after applying this month's security patch. Anthony McCann Well, on the plus side, at least the voice command was for a good cause Ailín Ó’S This has always happened to me, it's never worked. I have my phone in Irish/Gaeilge and Google in English (Ireland). Goyam Jain This issue has been with me on the Galaxy Su Edge running Android Marshmallow since when I bought it in November. It sucks when it happens JPJ My XL works sporadically and I'm using the Jan update. John Doe Trusted Voice isn't even available on the Nexus 6. I believe it used to be there but I don't know what happened. JasonIvers Did anyone ever find out why the Nexus 6 doesn't have that option? I never did see a reason, just that it was the case. It generally doesn't affect me, as I have trusted devices most places I would actually consider using it. Noeltorious Used to be there, and if you toggled it on it would toggle itself back off. Must've been really broken for them to disable and then remove it digitalcircuit I've had a similar issue where "Say 'Ok Google' any time" keeps turning off a split second after I enable it. Checking logcat points to "AlwaysOnHotword start recognition failed with error 14" and "sound_trigger stdev_load_sound_model failed." Upgrading/downgrading Google Search doesn't help. Frustratingly enough, this was working fine for a month or two on CM 13.. then broke. Then worked again when upgrading to CM 14.1.. then broke a month later. Nexus 6. Logan Snyder I have a 5X, I haven't noticed trusted voice turning off randomly, but I've noticed the "Ok Google command" has a lower and lower recognition rate until it becomes abysmal and almost never recognizes the command. I have to retrain the voice mondel like once a month. chinna_rao I've been having this problem with my device for quite some time but then, it just blew up when I repeatedly tried "OK Google" ing it...Samsung Note 7 matteventu "it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month" You are lucky then. With Pixel XL it happens that you setup the "Ok Google" always on and as trusted voice, and after HOURS it stops responding, forgetting the "vocal-training" you made. And there's no a toggle for this, you have to reinitiate every fu**ing time the vocal setup. Ernie Mine is fine sproc Well at least your fingerprint reader still exists, lol. Some of these issues are like Win9x era crap. ehTuBrutus Happens to me Everytime I switch between user accounts. Gives me a pop-up saying it has been turned off so I took it to be by design. I take it others have it happening even when not switching accounts? I wonder if Artemis has more than one user açcount on his phone? Andrew Palmer I used it to skip a track the other day. I didn't like the next track either so tried to do OK Google again. No response. Joe Mihalich I experienced this twice on the first day I received my pre-ordered Pixel XL. After i retrained it the second time, it hasn't happened again. Lucky me. Now if they would just fix the stupid freeze/lockup issue i can get on with my life. Brian Demodulated Trusted Voice is always turned on for me but often when I give a voice command I'm prompted to unlock my phone before the command is executed. So annoying. whispy_snippet Yep, I experience all of the above on my Pixel. Sucky. shamatuu yep nexus 6P. been turned off on its own for couple of months and yet Google seems to not care to fix it. really hope they fix it ASAP because they not what they used to be. blakeleeper Its happening on my Pixel XL v6.10.33.21 Kwetsima Maluleke Its been doing this to me for ages. About a year maybe. David Hyman Me too but it has been working a lot better for me for a while now Sharondhart Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !ue210c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Les Deplorables Yep...ages here too! Annoying. Michael Gerberich I have a similar issue with Trusted places. It works for a while and then just stops working. S7 Edge. vwnut13 Didn't OK Google used to work with a locked screen? Jimas Happens on my Nexus 6P Google v6.10.33.21. It started happening maybe a week or two ago, but it resets almost like every 2-3 days. Zaptor99 On my Note 4, I don't have Trusted Voices, I have "Personal Results". I turned it on. But If I go to Maps, Settings, Navigation, Ok Google, then the same screen from google app appears, but instead of "Personal Results", I see "Trusted Voice" and it's turned off and it then automatically turns off "Personal Results" in google app. Very confusing. Grey Are we reporting bugs on AP now? Because there are tons of bugs to report, especially with Google Now. It doesn't make sound anymore for one. If your phone is in landscape mode and you get it to turn on, it will turn on then stop because it's in landscape mode and you have to repeat it. Not to mention it does not respond every time. And try saying "remind me tonight dentist appointment at 11 am", cause what it will give you is a reminder for "tonight dentist appointment" due at 11 am. It's got issues. We gonna call them on all of it and try and get some pressure on Google to fix stuff? You gotta do it AP, we can't. Ibrahim Yusuf It happend for me on my nexus 5x on marshmallow, even updating to nougat didn't fix it. But I fixed it by deleting the voice model and retraining again. I got an answer on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5bgngq/cant_activate_always_on_ok_google_voice_detection/ Amir This is not new. I've been having this issue since the beginning of 2015 on my Nexus 6, 6P and now on Pixel XL. Ive completely given up on that feature. opticalgenesis Same here :( - also bonus points for Muse Himesh Kulkarni Same problem here but works less than a month, maybe like a few days. Also, I don't get any reply, it's just blank (doesn't work). Peter Me: "OK Google" Pixel: "Bleep" Me: "Read last message" Pixel: "You have one last message, would you like to hear it?" Me: "Yes" Pixel: "OK, cool, cool." ... Me: "WTF?" Andre Only once this has happened on my Nexus 5X. I have not experienced this issue in a while. jack_k1 I absolutely loath saying"OK Google". It just doesn't roll off the tongue. I feel like I'm gargling. demarcmj Even if it did "roll off the tongue," four syllables is just way too much. Fatty Bunter Google Home accepts "Hey google" too, which is much better. Hopefully they'll add this to phones too. Cory S Hey Google has a much lower activation rate than Okay Google for me, which is a shame because I hate that hot phrase. jack_k1 Try using Trusted Face when you have a long flowing beard. Hah! nxtiak YES!!! My Pixel XL suffers this issue, so f'ing annoying, I thought I was going crazy! JimOnTheBeach Yes happens on my new LG V20.i thought I was doing something wrong. Shawna Bartron This has never worked for me. LG Stylo 2 Travis James I don't have this issue, but I will keep yelling at my phone when driving "OK Google" with no response. When I have a chance to pick up my phone and unlock, I see that it can't reach Google, even though I have connectivity. Super annoying. Brandon Buchanan I use this feature all the time, but never have trouble with it on my Nexus 5x. King_Android Expect bugs with Beta. Uninstall beta clear data enable using default Google now launcher and all is well. catalysto For as long as I've had my 6P, I've had a similar problem. After a week or so, saying "OK Google" with the screen off stops working. If I toggle the settings off and back on, it works again for a while. But then usually by the time I actually need it, it has stopped working again. I gave up on it and just use the microphone button now for voice commands. Van_Hammersly It's done this to me on at least three separate phones over the past few years. Random and annoying. Each time I think when I get a new phone it'll stop doing it, foolishly. Parneet Singh It always does after few days on my nexus 5 X. Ok google stops responding to voice commands dmo580 That's not the same as Trusted Voice turning off. You're talking about OK Google detection just failing. The screenshots here specifically show the toggle being turned off. Let's not mix up two issues. Yvonne Campbell I have this issue as well, where both the 'trusted voice' and 'detection from any screen' toggles get turned off. gtoninn I have had the same thing happen to me. In addition to that the most recent update to the Google app has left my manually requested google searches with voice (IE I hit the voice search button), getting stuck and then the Google App has to be restarted. Also on a 6P Pyrazol You mention this now? It's been doing that to me for AGES. I thought switching from the Moto X to the Nexus 6 would ease my woes, but nooo. I just don't use that shit anymore because it's so freaking unreliable. dmo580 You don't even have trusted voice on the Nexus 6 as an option in the Google App. Keep in mind this issue is a very specific one regarding trusted voice. Moto's own implementation of always on listening is different as they pay for the license themselves. Cypress Frankenfeld Has anyone logged an issue on the Android bug tracker? I'd gladly star it. Joe Mine's always done this, it just randomly stops working. I always thought it was just because of updates causing it to shut down and needing to be reactivated. sea_hawk I have the same issue for a month. after I joined the 7.1.1 beta and then left the beta, but still experiencing the issue. sea_hawk Never mind... just tried enabling it, and it finally let me do that... not sure what happened. But in the past when I tried enabling trusted voice, it would ask me to input my pattern, but after I do that, the button stays "off"... sorry, not of much help HotRodJohnson Welcome to the world of the Nexus 6 users. The forum for this feature says, Hey Nexus 6 user, you can forget about it! Noeltorious I actually have a similar issue on the Pixel XL. I'll say OK Google and it will wake the screen up and show me the lock screen. Subsequent OK Google's or swiping to launch from the lock screen just point me to use my fingerprint to login. Once I use the fp-sensor the screen unlocks with Assistant launched. Weird and annoying, haven't figured out steps to reproduce because it's so random I don't think it's toggling off though because I never have to toggle anything on to fix it. RecalcitrantOne Just commenting to echo what others have said, happens to me and my 5x. Wouldn't mind being able to set my own "hot phrase." Either way, the emphasis is wrong with "Okay Google." The emphasis is on the second syllable of okay, but first for Google so it's not smooth. Rob I also noticed it deactivated many times, making it unreliable (Nexus 6P 7.1.1). It's been deactivating since the summer but it's a few weeks it hasn't anymore. I hope this gets addressed. Ashlynn This happens for me. Google Pixel version 7.1.1 - Google version 6.10.36.21amd 64. This recently started happening for me. Had no issues a few weeks ago. Chris Tashjian Same here!! It's been resetting on me daily for the last couple weeks jaxjoe Same issue with my PixelXL - was working up until 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't stay turned on for more than a few hours at a time Luke Taylor Ohhhhhh yeah. It'd happened to me only 4 or 5 times on my 6P in the last year, but suddenly in the past two weeks it's happened to me about 6 times- which is how I found this article just now. Come on, Google! stephen Galaxy s7. turns off in middle of voice searches and even while I'm typing in a search. Annoying to have to start typing all over again! Version 6.0.1 Niels Buekers I get this on my Pixel XL since a week or 2.. nikov I've had it happen a few times in the past on my Nexus 6P, but it has become very common in the last month or two. I'm running in to real issues with it at this point. bryguy76 I have a Pixel XL, worked fine for the first month, and then started turning off all the time. It's so annoying. Miguel Dey My pixel just started doing this.. any fix for it yet? Random! LG G3 D855, stock fw. Started happening to me a few days ago. Now this feature freaks out every couple days. Russ We have two Pixels and both do this. It's infuriating. It'll work flawlessly some days and then sometimes we'll say "OK, Google" and just get the lock screen and then go into the settings and find Trusted Voice has turned itself off arbitrarily. Trueblue711 It must be a bug with Google Play services. I'm one of the very few people with a Nexus 6p still running Android 6.0 and this bug happens to me all the time. Ronny Keller Disabling "Battery Optimization" for the item "ok Google enrollment" seems to do the trick for some users. Aaron Kelly I hope this does the trick. I'm trying it. It makes sense. Joe Mihalich This is still happening to me with google app 6.10.37.21. Kris Tyler This is happening at least monthly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Then it makes me retrain it and opt in. EVERY FREAKING TIME. So annoying, especially when it won't dial numbers when I'm driving. It's enough to make me consider an Apple. Al It happens on Pixel too. I'm starting to wonder if it's anytime the phone restarts. SSt Me too. Nexus 6p Laksamana Just happened to me since last week (Galaxy S6 on Android 6.0.1). Kept asking me to opt back in into Trusted Voice. Andrew Slater I have a 6p on version 7.1.1 and it had been doing this for a month or 2. But instead of it turning off a couple months apart, it turns off after only a couple days. Very annoying. JC Pixel XL, Android 7.1.2, Google App version 6.12.19.21.arm64. Does this multiple times a day, multiple times a week. So annoying it's driving me crazy. Been this this since my Nexus 6P a year ago Austin Ingram So annoying. It stays on for maybe a day or two then it's off again. Austin Ingram It may be related to training it in noisy environments - if you do that then try to activate it when it's quiet it may not recognize your voice and disable it for "security". Ankit Sud It's happening frequently with my Pixel as well. Defeats the biggest use case for Assistant in my opinion. Kyle Bailey Still happening with my Pixel. Is there any fix? bluescrubbie Just spent a while on chat with Google support. They say they've fixed the issue and we'll be rolling it out in an update soon. Patrick Ledwith Really? That's a relief. Wulf Nesthead 786 I'm sure it was indeed a relief; since, however, that was months ago and they have yet to fix it, are you still relieved? Patrick No need to cop an attitude with me. Garth Hedley I have Nexus 6P and 7.1.1. so fault is not restricted to earlier Android versions. I've set up TV numerous times. Each time after phone locks, Google app voice says can't do that phone is locked. Tatyana Tatyana I turn it on and the same day the "Trusted Voice" option will turn itself off. Drives me fucking bananas. PeterDTown Infuriating! It seems that every time I try to use this feature it's turned off again. Katie Conforti Seems if you don't use your phone for 4 hours the setting gets disabled. So annoying, makes assistant nearly worthless. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en Aaron Kelly My 6p has been doing this for about the last month or two. Every 3-7 days it happens. It's frustrating. I use the Trusted Voice to dial all the time, so when it doesn't work because of something like this, it makes me mad. Shannon Doak It is happening with my Pixel as well. stsin 6P on fi started doing it after I went off the beta os test due to severe battery issues. Dušan Todorović "trusted voice" my ***. After setting it for who knows how many times, yesterday, when i wanted it to start Clash of clans, that annoying answer pulled my nerve with "actually i cant do that while the device is locked, please, unlock blablabla.." for the last time. I disabled it. Guys doing the Ok Google "magic", clearly this is happening for a while and to many people, independant of android version, root opt, device, launcher, gapps version, google+ version, etc. Either fix the darn thing or stop pretending to be Siri's competitor. This sucks big time. Simon Jude I have this exact problem! I'm on an LG K7, anyone actually know how to fix this? Paul Kopalek My Nexus 6P turns the 'Anywhere' feature off INSTANTLY when I turn it on. Even when wiping Google app data, clean flashing the 7.1.1 ROM all over again, and disabling Battery Optimization for 'OK Google Enrollment. This is infuriating. Dave Segal HTC One M8 and galaxy 7 Yvonne Campbell Yes!! It's not just my trusted voice that gets turned off but my detection from any screen. Suddenly I can't just say "ok google" and get a response without touching my phone. Rather defeats the purpose. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Another issue I'm having, but think it would be a phone issue, is that I have answer calls with voice commands turned on, and even though it stays turned on, it does not work anymore. PP Saini I have the opposite issue. The "any time" option will not stay off. I toggle it off, but am immediately able to say OK Google with my phone responding. Check the setting, and it is oddly back on. Kristina Starck Constantly on my Note 5. It also pops up a window asking me what I just said everytime I listen to anything with my headphones plugged in. Even disabling the assistant altogether doesnt stop the spam. Callahan Jason Droid Maxx 2 - used to turn off randomly, more recently I can not keep it on. If I switch it on back out to previous screen then go back-it will be off Salazryl Ismail I have this issue too on my SGS3 and HTC One M8 Jean-Sebastien Penney Same here about once a week Nexus 6p Stapin Does this on an LG KV8 as well. Restarting the phone works, sometimes I have to since the assistant fails to respond even after the phone is manually unlocked Elijah Francis Pixel XL: Voice search keeps shutting off for me shortly after using it. Also the search bar won't even begin to load search results either.... REALLY annoying when you're driving and want search somewhere with a simple voice command. After this bug shows up seemingly immediately I'm forced to restart the phone only for it to happen AGAIN. Google fix this shit. Annduhroo It's started doing this on my Pixel... Not okay at all. Wulf Nesthead 786 I have marshmallow on a droid turbo and I can't get trusted voice to work for me for as much as a single day. Google released a "workaround" which literally does nothing to fix the problem. I don't know whether they are malicious and derive glee from their lies, or are just stupid. Ordinarily one would think that if one releases a workaround, it would actually, well, work. Tracy Clarenson It doesn't even last 3 days for me. I have an S7 edge.

But him and his wife Kara had already been living out of a Winnebago RV for months, and were wary of blowing Pete's newfound salary on rent in Silicon Valley.  The logical solution - parking their makeshift house-on-wheels in the Google parking lot and living out of it for almost two years. The couple gave Business Insider a tour of their RV, which they had originally paid $1,900 for, pointing out the ways they had maximized the tiny space. A mounted twin bed takes up most of the larger space, but allows for storage underneath. The minuscule bathroom is multi-purpose, and includes a sink that folds down and a shower head that can be coiled away.  Scroll down for video  Pete D’Andrea works at Google and used to live in the company's parking lot. Him and his wife Kara slept and cooked in a tiny Winnebago for almost two years They originally paid $1,900 for the RV and maximized the small space by having a folding sink, a makeshift toilet and mounted mattress A person can only fit in the bathroom, however, if they keep the door open or slide two wall panels out. The toilet has a bowl instead of a tank, which is emptied after every use.  The lack of amenities, amazingly, did not deter Pete's coworkers from visiting. 'People liked us when we lived on campus,' Pete, who has since moved out of the Winnebago and bought a home with Kara, said. 'They used to always come and hang out at our RV for drinks after work.' 'We always had beer and meat, so I don't know, maybe we were buying peoples' love,' Kara added. Despite the functionality of the RV, security guards at the company were not amused by their ingenuity at first.  'Google security was onto us pretty quick. They surrounded the van one day,' Pete told Business Insider. Pete said he stepped out of the RV and showed them his badge, explaining that he worked 90 hours a week at the tech company. After that point, security would stop by from time to time and check on the couple, but never bothered them. Pete and Kara said it was like having their own security team and that over time they became 'buddies' with the officials. The couple originally started their journey in the Winnebago in 2010.  Kara and Pete have since moved into a real house, but said 'having a mortgage has been way more stressful' than sharing the RV RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Cabo's comeback: Three years after hurricanes devastated the... Smash hit Wonder Woman makes $101.4MILLION over the weekend... Share this article Share 'We were in Chicago and we decided to go on a great adventure. We sold everything we owned and bought this here LeSharo,' Pete said. Pete has just gotten his MBA and thought Austin 'is where all the jobs are,' so the duo hit the road. During their journey, funds slowly dwindled. 'I think we were down to our last $50. And we were arguing in line at Walmart, [should we get] rice and beans or rice, beans and beer,' Pete said. 'On the way to the checkout a recruiter called me and said they were going to do a hiring event in San Antonio.' Pete aced the Google interview, and just like that, he and Kara packed up and took off.   After living in the RV in the parking lot for a year-and-a-half to two years, Pete was able to save 80 percent of his income and finally put a down payment on a house nearby.  Though the duo has settled into the new home, which features a walk-in closet as big as their Winnebago, they still reminisce on their parking lot days.  'We just didn't ever want to be as broke as we were. That was the scariest point, because we just never knew where food was gonna come from the week that I went on that interview and it really freaked us out,' Pete said. 'We wanted to feel comfortable and a lot of people probably think this is the antithesis of comfortable, but I actually really loved it, I was really happy in the Winnebago,' Kara said. 'Having a mortgage has been way more stressful than ever living in this,' Pete added.

Well, that’s not always true. When it comes to branded bidding wars on Google paid search, things can turn real nasty. Imagine the scene. You wake up one morning, search for your company’s brand name in Google, and discover your competitor has stolen the number 1 position in paid search and is gobbling up a large percentage of your traffic. This is no ordinary traffic either. This is highly valuable traffic — they’re your best potential (or existing) customers. For most brands, this would cause instant chaos, especially if your brand terms are searched for in large volumes. So, what next? Surely if you report this PPC shark to Google, they will take immediate action and remove their listing, right? Think again. Google lifted the ban on bidding on competitors’ branded keywords way back in 2008, and since then it’s been completely acceptable to bid against your competitor’s brand, as long as you don’t mention their trademark name within your ad copy. It’s a bit of a gray area, but completely fair in Google’s eyes. Many of us will already know about Samsung’s famous ‘Awkward. You obviously mean’ Google AdWords campaign targeting Apple’s precious iPhone 6s branded terms. And I have to admit, this is creatively genius. It sparked plenty of media attention and the traffic was highly valuable. But I can guarantee Apple didn’t look at this in the same light. In such a scenario, what would the best course of action? Step 1: Acknowledge That Your Competitor May Never Take Down the Listing It’s a tough blow to accept, but your competitor is under no legal obligation to remove their ads as long as they aren’t using your brand name in their ad text. You have to come to terms with the fact that they will never remove the ads. The results may just be really powerful for them, leading to a high ROI/ROAS which could potentially be their most profitable campaign of all. If they’re using your trademark name in their ad copy, however, this can be an infringement of Google’s trademark policy and therefore, you can submit a request to Google have their ads removed. Step 2: Check Google Search Partners Google isn’t the only search engine you should monitor for branded PPC. Its search partners could potentially be driving your competitors a lot of traffic. Unfortunately, Google doesn’t disclose a list of its search partners as its network is growing and they are subject to change at any point. That said, some of the most popular search partners are AOL.com, Ask.com, Dogpile.com, and Amazon.com. Here’s an example of how the ads would appear on Amazon. For this example, I searched for “Gym Shark”, which is a popular sports and activewear brand based in the UK. If you’d like to dig a bit further to uncover more search partners, a list can be found here, albeit they may not be 100% accurate. Step 3: Check Bing and Its Search Partners For sure, Google is by far the most dominant search engine, but don’t underestimate the power of Bing and its search partners to drive highly relevant, targeted traffic. This is not always true for unbranded search because CPCs tend to be lower, but conversion rates aren’t always as high as the Google search network. For branded search, however, you may just uncover a heap of new customers you never knew existed. If your competitors are going full throttle stealing your most prestigious web traffic, chances are they’re taking advantage of Bing and its search partners, too — particularly Yahoo. So keep your eyes peeled. Step 4: Send Your Competitor a Polite Email Request Think twice before going all out guns blazing, picking up the phone for a good old argument with your competitor. Chances are, this will only make matters worse and they will be even more determined to conquer your branded search traffic. This could potentially have a serious impact on your bottom line, particularly if your USP is difficult to distinguish or your competitor has incentives in place to steal away your customers. The best course of action is to send a polite email to your competitor asking them to take down the ad, in the interest of fair play. You can certainly send a word of warning later about your plans to take PPC revenge, but you should first give them an opportunity to remove the ads. It could be the case that their PPC agency has set up these ads without permission or any prior notice. (This isn’t a good agency practice, but it’s been known to happen.) Step 5: Set Up Your Own Branded Search Ads Whoa, you mean to say you haven’t already done this? Branded PPC ads are an absolute must. This is especially true if you wholesale products to other retailers. Take Nike, for example: But why would brands such as Nike bid on their own branded keywords if they’re already ranking highly organically? Simply put, this allows brands to dominate the SERPs. Having multiple listings in Google (both paid and organic) can drastically improve your click-through rates and micro and macro conversions. Unless there are numerous brands bidding against your brand name and thus increasing the bids, the CPCs are usually really cheap and you can maintain full control of your brand messaging. Additionally, if you’re targeting your brand name as a broad or phrase match, you can check the search term reports to see what other terms people are associating with your brand. Did I mention the cost-per-clicks are really cheap? You should also consider targeting ‘top of page’ bid strategy to ensure your branded search ad is always at the top of the search results, capitalizing on the bulk of the traffic and knocking your competitors down. But this depends on their level of PPC knowledge and, ultimately, how much they’re willing to pay for placement positions. Step 6: Consider Targeting Your Competitors’ Branded Keywords As a last resort, but a tactic which can absolutely be worthwhile, is targeting your competitors’ precious branded terms with a new ad campaign. This may lure your competitor into taking their ads down as a mutual agreement to doing the same. If their brand search volume is much lower than yours, however, this most likely won’t be the case as they will see more benefit from targeting your keywords. Targeting your competitors brand terms as “revenge” can be considered as damage limitation, but it certainly can be a route worth taking if they’re reluctant to remove their ads. Conclusion Targeting your competitors branded terms can certainly be highly profitable, although it can lead to a serious marketing war which could be more damaging in the long-run. It’s important to weigh all the pros and cons before taking the plunge. Remember to do your research prior to taking this dark route. Image Credits Featured image put together by Joshua Daniels.

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 129 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares221 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both. Merlyn Nak-nak Clemente Ich bin der Mann der euch das Angstspürren spüren läst.meine Frau ist mir scheiss egal.meine kinder sind mir wischtiger erptastic k. Artem Russakovskii Went live for me today. Finally no more inviting my wife to all the stuff we do together. Peter I'm too lazy to check, but i assume this isn't available to G Suite accounts? Peter To answer my own question, yeah GSuite not supported. keithzg Yeah, but you have Hangouts Chat whereas we all know that Hangouts is gonna eventually stop working for the rest of us, so it all balances out ;) Deborahthampton Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Grey I really hope we all get Hangouts Chat. It's not live for anyone yet, but I really hope it replaces regular Hangouts. It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only I could use it with G Suite. Spy Katcher Google keeps nipping around the edges of actually making something useful like integrating Calendar with Google Home. C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me. (Grumble Grumble) Tv One feature I'd like to see with this is the ability to disable individual family members on specific Google products. For example, we have the grandparents as part of our family group. The "Family Group" sharing is useful for Play Music and Photos, but they don't need to be part of shared Keep and Calendar items.

Alexa now supports reminders and named timers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 10:28am PDTJun 3, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares154 News It has been a little over 200 days since the Google Home was officially released, and owners are still waiting on Google to implement support for reminders. Perhaps in response to the growing competition, Amazon has been hard at work improving Alexa, and has now added reminders and named timers to the assistant. The reminders work pretty much as you would expect - asking "remind me to take out the trash Sunday night" will prompt your Alexa-powered device to notify you when the time comes. The named timers can be created with phrases like, "Set an oven timer for 10 minutes." Amazon only explicitly mentioned the Echo in the announcement, so it's possible these features are limited to Amazon's own devices for now and could require a software update for others (I don't have an Alexa device to test). It also seems to be limited to the United States at the time of writing, for some reason. Tags alexa amazon assistant named timers reminders timers subscribe ...

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 129 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares221 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both. Merlyn Nak-nak Clemente Ich bin der Mann der euch das Angstspürren spüren läst.meine Frau ist mir scheiss egal.meine kinder sind mir wischtiger erptastic k. Artem Russakovskii Went live for me today. Finally no more inviting my wife to all the stuff we do together. Peter I'm too lazy to check, but i assume this isn't available to G Suite accounts? Peter To answer my own question, yeah GSuite not supported. keithzg Yeah, but you have Hangouts Chat whereas we all know that Hangouts is gonna eventually stop working for the rest of us, so it all balances out ;) Deborahthampton Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Grey I really hope we all get Hangouts Chat. It's not live for anyone yet, but I really hope it replaces regular Hangouts. It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only I could use it with G Suite. Spy Katcher Google keeps nipping around the edges of actually making something useful like integrating Calendar with Google Home. C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me. (Grumble Grumble) Tv One feature I'd like to see with this is the ability to disable individual family members on specific Google products. For example, we have the grandparents as part of our family group. The "Family Group" sharing is useful for Play Music and Photos, but they don't need to be part of shared Keep and Calendar items.

Google dedicates doodle to actress Nutan Different emotions brought alive on the screen by late actress Nutan's expressive face were depicted as part of a Google doodle on her 81st birth anniversary on Sunday.IANS | Updated: Jun 4, 2017, 05.28 PM IST Different emotions brought alive on the screen by late actress Nutan's expressive face were depicted as part of a Google doodle on her 81st birth anniversary on Sunday. "Today's Doodle reflects Nutan's expressive acting style on what would have been her 81st birthday. It was hard to sum up her genius in a single portrait, and so we depicted four distinct expressions," Google said in a statement. Cops: Youths may have also stolen antiques from Nutan’s bungalow The image reflects her expressions as a conflicted murderess from "Bandini", the anguished untouchable from "Sujata", the hell-raising orphan from "Seema" -- all memorable characters played by Nutan, a celebrated Indian film actress known for communicating complex emotions using only facial expressions and body language rather than dialogue, the statement read. Her faces fill up for the "oo" in Google. An icon of Indian cinema for over four decades, Nutan pioneered powerful women-centric films in an age when male actors dominated the silver screen. Over her career, her distinct, groundbreaking style helped solidify an award-winning legacy. She was honoured with Padma Shri in 1974 for her contribution to the Arts and a total of six Filmfare Awards, five of which were for Best Actress.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman A guide to successfully investing in paid advertising Paid advertising can be a great way to guide more traffic to your site and increase business, however it can be an expensive endeavor if you don’t really know what you are doing. This article tackles the three most popular platforms for online advertising, and whether they are worth it for small businesses to invest in. Find out everything you need to know about using paid ads to promote your small business. 1. Google paid ads Let’s start with the most obvious one, Google! According to Statista, “in November 2016, Google was ranked first amongst the most visited multi-platform web properties in the United States with 246 million U.S. unique visitors and a market share of 63.4% among the leading U.S. search engine providers.” Regarding Google’s paid advertising: · Google has tracked 4 billion store visits from ad clicks. · 39.6 percent of those Global Search Ad clicks come from desktops, and 48.9 percent comes from smartphones. · The clickthrough rate for mobile search ads on Google’s first place is 27.7 percent. Google offers two types of paid ads through Google AdWords, namely display ads and text ads. Display ads will appear while you are browsing on various websites and targeted through past searches. Text ads appear at the top or the side of every Google search page. These are ads that a company pays for so that people will notice their business whenever they’re searching Google. The company only has to pay whenever someone clicks on the ad, also known as pay-per-click advertising (PPC). Given the vast influence this search engine has, it is important to take time to consider whether Google AdWords can be beneficial to your small business. Challenges Investing in Google paid ads can bring about tremendous results, but unfortunately it does not work for everyone. It ultimately depends on your SEO value and type of business. The success of banner ads will vary based on your industry. For instance, if your audience is younger and more tech savvy, chances are they won’t click on a banner ad because they know it’s an ad. But, if you are promoting retirement services, your audience (i.e. the elderly population) will be more likely to click on them. Pay-per-click ads will have different degrees of success depending on which keywords you are trying to rank for. If you have a lot of competition and can’t invest a lot of money per click, you are going to get stuck on the Google’s 10th page. If you try to rank for niche keywords, you’ll be able to rank higher. At the early stages of Google’s paid advertising, it was a very effective strategy for small businesses. However, as AdWords has gotten more expensive it has become difficult for small companies to compete with mega brands. Interestingly, Google announced that they would be testing their local 3-pack to include one local ad and only two organic local results. This could be a game changer for small businesses interested in advertising on Google. Should you use Google’s paid ads? Overall, pursuing Google AdWords can be an expensive online advertising channel for small businesses. It all depends on your industry, as well as the budget you have for acquiring new customers. If you have decided to pursue this advertising strategy, check out Entrepreneur’s starter guide to setting up your Google AdWords campaigns. But if this is a little out of your league, Facebook and Instagram provide cheaper options for online advertising. 2. Facebook paid ads Facebook ads run on the same pay-per-click (or pay-per-impression) idea as Google’s ads. According to the Huffington Post , “thanks to amount of personal information in Facebook’s database, they allow you to get ridiculously detailed with your targeting. Anything a user can put into their profile — age, sex, location, education, religion, interests, politics, job title, marital status, etc. — can be used as a filter for your ads.” The best part is that Facebook Ads are surprisingly affordable! Here are some Facebook stats: · The platform has 1.71 billion monthly active users and 1.13 billion daily active users, on average. · Everyone on Facebook is connected to one another by an average of 3.57 degrees of separation. · Facebook takes up 22 percent of the internet time Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11 percent on Google search and YouTube combined. Challenges Facebook advertising usually fails for two reasons: either the business didn’t have a solid strategy in place, or they approached Facebook Ads with the wrong intentions. The most important thing to keep in mind is that Facebook Ads are passive, meaning they’re shown when the consumer isn’t necessarily in the buying mood. Direct selling on Facebook can, therefore, be tricky and its success depends on your product. According to Matthew Tyson , a marketing strategist, the most effective uses of Facebook Ads for small businesses are 1) increasing brand awareness and social exposure, and 2) capturing and nurturing leads. In terms of measuring your Facebook campaign, you should focus on Social ROI. More specifically, measure how engaged your audience is by looking at impressions, reach, likes, shares, click-through-rate and so on. You can analyze these metrics in real-time and adjust your Facebook ads along the way to increase their impact. Should you use Facebook’s paid ads? In conclusion, Facebook advertising is one of the most affordable and effective ways to market your business. In fact, 92 percent of social marketers use Facebook advertising. Just make sure you have a clear strategy in place, including realistic goals and objectives. 3. Instagram paid ads Since it launched 7 years ago, it has become clear that Instagram isn’t just for selfies and animal pictures. Instagram is one of the leading social media platforms for image-based content, with over 600 million active monthly users. But where this platform really shines is its level of user engagement: Engagement with brand on Instagram is 10 times higher than Facebook, 54 times higher than Pinterest and 84times higher than Twitter. What’s more: · This platform is nicknamed “the king of social media.” · Instagram accumulates 4.2 billion likes per day. · Instagram now has more than 1 million monthly advertisers, up five times from a year ago. In fact, the rise in marketers can be attributed in large part to Instagram’s focus on catering to small businesses, which make up the majority of Instagram’s advertisers, and its growing suite of free business tools. Besides providing all the important statistics, Instagram allows companies to observe how their unpaid posts perform organically before deciding which one is best to use for an ad campaign. Challenges Similar to Facebook, Instagram allows small and niche businesses to find new customers through their targeting abilities. For instance, you can use traits like gender, age groups and interests to target your ad campaign. However, small businesses need to take into account that this requires you to know your target audience and how to reach them. You need to be able to create images that elicit a response from that audience. Therefore, research is essential, as well as trial and error. It is also important to note that in order to create a Business Profile on Instagram, you need to be able to connect it to a Facebook Business Page. This is because Instagram works with Facebook to pull the audience information relevant to your ad campaign. So, you will have to set up these social media profiles before you get started. Should you use Instagram’s paid ads? Instagram is definitely worth investing in, especially as a small business. Even if you are not (actively) on Instagram yet, you can build a following with the help of their sponsored posts. However, if you do not have a clear grasp on who your target audience is, you will have to take a step back to pinpoint the most defining audience traits.

In fact, the rise in marketers can be attributed in large part to Instagram’s focus on catering to small businesses, which make up the majority of Instagram’s advertisers, and its growing suite of free business tools. Besides providing all the important statistics, Instagram allows companies to observe how their unpaid posts perform organically before deciding which one is best to use for an ad campaign. Challenges Similar to Facebook, Instagram allows small and niche businesses to find new customers through their targeting abilities. For instance, you can use traits like gender, age groups and interests to target your ad campaign. However, small businesses need to take into account that this requires you to know your target audience and how to reach them. You need to be able to create images that elicit a response from that audience. Therefore, research is essential, as well as trial and error. It is also important to note that in order to create a Business Profile on Instagram, you need to be able to connect it to a Facebook Business Page. This is because Instagram works with Facebook to pull the audience information relevant to your ad campaign. So, you will have to set up these social media profiles before you get started. Should you use Instagram’s paid ads? Instagram is definitely worth investing in, especially as a small business. Even if you are not (actively) on Instagram yet, you can build a following with the help of their sponsored posts. However, if you do not have a clear grasp on who your target audience is, you will have to take a step back to pinpoint the most defining audience traits.

Im Gespräch mit "Werben & Verkaufen" hält er beide Plattformen für "dramatisch überbewertet" und fordert von Werbungtreibenden einen kritischeren Umgang. von Marcel Pohlig 04.06.2017 - 13:07 Uhr Erst im März teilten Guido Modenbach und Thomas Port von SevenOne Media gegen Facebook aus. In Matthias Dang, Geschäftsführer der Kölner Konkurrenz von IP Deutschland, haben sie einen Unterstützer gefunden. Auch Dang holt nun zum Rundumschlag gegen Facebook, aber auch Google aus. Der IP-Boss gesteht beiden Unternehmen im Gespräch mit "Werben & Verkaufen" zwar zu, in der Ansprache von Zielgruppen genauer zu sein. "Aber bei allen anderen nachweisbaren Parametern schneiden Google und Facebook schlechter ab. Deshalb sind sie im Werbemarkt dramatisch überbewertet", meint Dang, der sich zugleich aber sicher ist, dass Google und Facebook langsam aus der "Hype-Welt" herauskommen und in der realen Welt ankommen. "Sie müssen nun beweisen, wie ihr leistungsertrag tatsächlich aussieht." Für die Zukunft wünscht sich Dang, dass Werbungtreibende mit Facebook und YouTube ähnlich umgehen werden wie mit allen anderen Medien, wie er anhand eines Beispiels erklärt. "Vor 20 Jahren gab es eine große Debatte um 'Big Brother', aktuell geht um eine Sendung wie 'Naked Attraction' auf RTL II. Es gibt immer noch Unternehmen, die uns erklären: Ich möchte nicht nur in diesen Umfeldern nicht werben. ich möchte überhaupt keinen Sender belegen, der so etwas zeigt", erklärt Dang und fragt sich: "Wo aber bleibt diese Frage gegenüber YouTube und Facebook? Die Werbungtreibenden stellen lediglich die Frage: Ist meine Werbung in solchen Umfeldern gelaufen?" "Das greift zu kurz", urteilt Dang und verweist auf den Fall des bei Facebook live übertragenen Mord an einem Kind, der erst 24 Stunden später von der Plattform genommen wurde. Nach Ansicht von Dang sollten die Plattformen für ihre Inhalte auch zur Verantwortung gezogen werden. "Auch eine Tech-Plattform trägt Verantwortung für Inhalte, die dort zu sehen sind", meint Dang gegenüber der "W&V". "Und außerdem finanzieren sich Facebook und Google zu 100 Prozent aus Werbung. Sie agieren wie Vermarkter. Und deshalb sollten sie auch vom Werbemarkt mit den gleichen Maßstäben gemessen werden wie echte Medien", fühlt sich der Geschäftsführer von IP Deutschland ungerecht behandelt. Abhängig machen möchte sich Dang von Facebook und Google ohnehin nicht. Er ist überzeugt davon, dass sich seine Sendergruppe es leisten könne, den beiden Unternehmen einen Korb zu verpassen und verweist dabei auf die Networks in den USA, die den gleichen Weg gehen. "Wir würden niemals auf YouTube oder Facebook komplette Serienfolgen zeigen. Dann würden wir einen Hauptwettbewerber auf dem Werbemarkt stützen – und das schließt sich strategisch komplett aus", argumentiert der IP-Deutschland-Chef. Die Reichweiten, welche Plattformen wie jene von Google und Facebook, möchte Dang dennoch nicht ungenutzt lassen. Er versteht sie allerdings viel mehr "als Promotionsplattform, um unsere eigenen Angebote wie TV Now zu stärken." Ansehen möchte sich Dang Angebote von Facebook, wie etwa einer derzeit seitens des Netzwerks angestrebten Vermarktungskooperation, aber auf jeden Fall, um sie überhaupt bewerten zu können. Große Chancen sollte sich Facebook allerdings nicht ausrechnen. "Eins ist jedoch klar", stellt Dang heraus, "die Konkurrenz stark zu machen ist nicht in unserem Interesse". Wenig später verdeutlicht Dang nochmals, was er damit konkret meint: "Wir werden uns auf kein Modell einlassen, bei dem wir Videovermarktungserlöse teilen müssten", beschreibt der IP-Boss eine Linie, die sein Unternehmen niemals überschreiten werde, auch wenn man sich in den vergangenen Jahren ehemals abgelehnten Modellen, etwa in der Zusammenarbeit mit Sky, geöffnet habe. Auch über Amazon werde man abseits des neuen Abo-Angebots Amazon Channels, wo Geo Television zur Verfügung steht, im Übrigen nie RTL-Content ausstrahlen und Amazon die Gelegenheit geben, damit Erlöse zu erzielen, so Dang.

Not every Chromebook will get this feature, though. There are more than 80 models that are eventually going to be able to run Android apps. Google has now rolled out Android app support to new Chromebooks from Lenovo, HP, and Acer. There are 14 Chromebook models that have currently received some form of support for Android apps as some have received this feature in the beta channel. A couple of new models have been released recently that have come with the Google Play Store installed right out of the box, Samsung’s Chromebook Pro is one of those models. The HP Chromebook x360 11 G1 EE is one of the models that has now received support for Android apps. However, support for Android apps on this Chromebook is currently in the Chrome OS Beta channel at this point in time so users will have to switch between the two if they want to use it. Lenovo’s ThinkPad 11e and 11e Yoga Chromebooks now support Android apps as well albeit also in the Beta channel. So they will have to switch between the two if they would like to use Android apps on their Chromebook. Last but not the least, we have the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 which has full support for Android apps. It’s going to come with the Play Store installed right out of the box. Filed in Computers.

Credit: Benny Marty/ShutterstockMore Credit: Benny Marty/Shutterstock Samsung has 14 models listed, including its recent flagship phones the Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Active. As you'd expect, all of Google's recent devices make the cut, but so do models from lesser-known brands such as General Mobile, Gionee and Oppo. The Google list, which was released yesterday (June 1) and which you can see here, isn't of which phones immediately receive the updates — only Google's own phones do so — but those models "with a majority of deployed devices running a security update from the last two months." Manufacturer Device BlackBerry PRIV Fujitsu F-01J General Mobile GM5 Plus d, GM5 Plus, General Mobile 4G Dual, General Mobile 4G Gionee A1 Google Pixel XL, Pixel, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9 LGE LG G6, V20, Stylo 2 V, GPAD 7.0 LTE Motorola Moto Z, Moto Z Droid Oppo CPH1613, CPH1605 Samsung Galaxy S8+, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S7 Active, Galaxy S6 Active, Galaxy S5 Dual SIM, Galaxy C9 Pro, Galaxy C7, Galaxy J7, Galaxy On7 Pro, Galaxy J2, Galaxy A8, Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 Sharp Android One S1, 507SH Sony Xperia XA1, Xperia X Vivo Vivo 1609, Vivo 1601, Vivo Y55 Credit: Google MORE: Best Android Antivirus Software and Apps The list also includes the BlackBerry PRIV, the Motorola Moto Z and Moto Z Droid, the LG G6 and the Sony Xperia X and XA1, as well as models from Vivo, Sharp and Fujitsu. Google notes that another 50 or so devices run updates from the last 90 days, but it doesn't provide a list of those. Phones that install the latest security updates are a small but growing minority in the Android world. Whereas 80 to 90 percent of iPhones and iPads run the latest version of iOS, the Android update process has tended to be a fragmented mess, with security updates reaching individual handset months late, if ever. As of May 2, only 7 percent of the devices with Google Play installed were running Nougat, the latest version of Android that contains the most modern security protections. The silver lining is that another 82 percent ran the older versions Marshmallow, Lollipop or KitKat, which still may get security updates, depending on the age of the device. (Even Google's own phones are cut off after their third birthdays.) The next version of Android, code-named "Android O" (Oreo? Oh Henry? Ovaltine?), may solve this problem. It will introduce a new software framework called Project Treble that aims to separate the operating system from the handset, letting Google push out nearly-immediate security updates to far more models. The updates will still need to be customized for specific chipset architectures, such as those made by Qualcomm or Samsung, but there are only a handful of those in widespread use among mobile devices.  See also : 15 Android Security Tips You Need to Know Why Apple iPhones Don't Need Antivirus Software 15 Best Mobile Privacy and Security Apps How to Protect Your Identity, Personal Data and Property Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Inventor of “Iron Man” jet suit beats his own speed record Yahoo Tech Cleans Better with Fewer Sheets* CharminSponsored How to install Android apps on your Windows computer, the easy way Digital Trends Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass will end your free time forever Yahoo Tech Google's autonomous car company is now testing out self-driving trucks Yahoo Tech Get a softer clean while using less* CharminSponsored Uber posts $708 million loss and says finance head left Yahoo Tech New leak sheds light on Apple’s secretive ‘smart glasses’ project BGR News How the Microsoft Surface Pro compares to Apple's best Yahoo Tech This Amazing Device Should Be Banned RadSpeed Detector ProSponsored Microsoft's Skype draws inspiration from Snapchat in big redesign Yahoo Tech How Washington is throwing away its shot at protecting your privacy Yahoo Tech Rumor claims Apple’s MacBook Air line is dead BGR News A Card Now Offering a $200 Bonus To New Customers NextAdvisorSponsored Why Amazon let 4,000 dogs into its Seattle headquarters Yahoo Tech Mark Zuckerberg: The most important thing I built at Harvard Yahoo Tech Zuckerberg to Harvard grads: 'You have to create a sense of purpose for others' Yahoo Tech F 22 Raptor Does Things Scientist Cant Figure Out The BrofessionalSponsored Foxconn insider drops avalanche of information about the iPhone 8, new MacBooks, Apple’s smart glasses and more BGR News No, your Apple computer isn't immune from ransomware Yahoo Tech The new Samsung Galaxy does 27 things the iPhone doesn't Yahoo Tech 5 Most Rewarding Travel Card Offers NerdWalletSponsored The most important announcements from Google's big developers' conference Yahoo Tech Box office hits and misses: ‘Wonder Woman’ triumphs with record-setting weekend Digital Trends How to avoid the massive WannaCry ransomware attack Yahoo Tech Wallet-worthy upgrade—Discover Cashback Match Discover CardSponsored A widely praised Supreme Court decision still doesn't fix the broken patent system Yahoo Tech

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 129 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares221 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both.

Grey I really hope we all get Hangouts Chat. It's not live for anyone yet, but I really hope it replaces regular Hangouts. It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only I could use it with G Suite. Spy Katcher Google keeps nipping around the edges of actually making something useful like integrating Calendar with Google Home. C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me. (Grumble Grumble) Tv One feature I'd like to see with this is the ability to disable individual family members on specific Google products. For example, we have the grandparents as part of our family group. The "Family Group" sharing is useful for Play Music and Photos, but they don't need to be part of shared Keep and Calendar items.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

With this update, publishers can now build their articles on this platform before they use other versions. By making it compatible with other platforms, it helps in cutting down the distribution costs. This announcement is also an indication that Facebook’s Instant Articles isn’t as popular as other publishing forms. If the company can assure that publishers will use all platforms equally, it doesn’t have to worry about Google gaining an edge. “The updated SDK transforms the markup publishers use to create Instant Articles to generate the code needed to build these other formats, removing what we’ve heard can be a resource-heavy step in publishing on multiple platforms. With an easy way to get from one markup format to another, publishers can then plug-and-play the markup in their content management systems or third party publishing tools.” The SDK allows developers to integrate publishing Instant Articles to their CMS. When you create articles in Instant Articles Style Editor, you can apply custom styling templates in Google AMP and Apple News. The custom formats that you’ve designed in the Editor will be the same on other platforms. In other words, you don’t have to worry about the style of your article for Apple News or AMP because the SDK will do the heavy lifting. The future of online publishing is no longer decided by the media business but by the tech companies that collect and distribute the information. It’s shown in a standards battle led by Facebook, Apple, and Google. Each of them owns a proprietary format that makes articles into simple forms on mobile. Instant Articles struggled to grow. The AMP format, on the other hand, is getting more and more popular every day. Apple News maximizes its placement on iOS devices because it’s a native app that pushes a walled-garden approach in delivering the news. Some publishers of Instant Articles left the platform because Facebook doesn’t help them grow audiences or earn money. One of the advantages of Google is that it continues to make Chrome and search experience reader-friendly with AMP. Facebook would want to be a destination where people consume anything and be considered as a way to access the rest of the Internet. Apple, on the other hand, is more interested in turning its iOS as the best method to perform anything on a smartphone. But will the changes entice publishers to use Instant Articles again? Some of them might come back. Facebook has also made a deal with other media companies to produce more original videos. The company will prioritize these videos over other Instant Articles links from third-party publishers. “This new flexibility with Instant Articles is part of our commitment to open standards of collaboration with the community. Our goal is to give publishers control over extending and modifying the Instant Articles building blocks to be the best storytellers on every platform.” Despite its stagnant growth, Facebook’s power over publishers is still high. Publishers are still using Facebook’s platform to publish articles, video, live video and Instant articles.

Not even in the same postcode as the ball, but uses his hands to thump it high and handsome right back over Jadeja’s head and under the covers in front of the sight screen who, thankfully, look like they are staying put for the rest of the evening.

The rough cost of Pakistan’s two drops – Kohli and Yuvraj – is 80. Sound start from these two. Vijayendra Singh has asked for some DLS figures. Will do my best to get my head around it, what with the various fluctuations upon the fall of wickets. Expect your first update after 10 overs.

Short and wide, though, allowing Shehzad to stand tall and let his hands flow through a cut behind point for four. The rain will have slicked the pitch and, a few more hits along the damp outfield will curtail any swing. Pull around the corner for one, despite a misfield, and Shehzad keeps the strike.

Earlier this month, we got to know that Google confirmed that Asus ZenFone AR will be arriving sometime later this summer. During an interview with Engadget, ASUS CEO Jerry Shen confirmed that the timeframe of Asus ZenFone AR unavailability in Taiwan and the US.  However, there is no information on the pricing of ASUS ZenFone AR smartphone. The Asus ZenFone AR will be available for purchase in US in July while it will go on sale in Taiwan in mid-June. It is also to be noted that the smartphone will be carrier-exclusive to Verizon Wireless. This is the first time that a US carrier will be selling a smartphone that's infused with Google's Tango augmented reality (AR) technology. Asus Zenfone AR is the second smartphone, after Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, which comes equipped with Google aspirational project, Tango. The smartphone also supports Google Daydream VR, which makes it the first smartphone to feature both Tango and Daydream technologies. For those who are not aware, Tango is a technology platform developed and authored by Google that uses computer vision to enable mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to detect their position relative to the world around them without using GPS, while Daydream is Google's take on the high-quality mobile VR experience. Though Phab 2 Pro was the first device to come equipped with Tango it was let down with some mediocre specs, but the Zenfone AR is a true flagship device which comes with some insane specifications. The device comes with a 5.7-inch WQHD Super AMOLED display with a screen resolution of 2560x1440 pixels, which makes it an ideal device to run augmented reality apps. Under the hood, the Zenfone AR packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, which the company is optimised for Tango. Though Qualcomm unveiled its state-of-the-art Snapdragon 835 processor, Asus says that ZenFone AR was developed in close cooperation with Google to deliver the best Tango and Daydream experiences. The device is also the first to sport a whopping 8GB of RAM and the company has also promised that the device will come in different variants including a 6GB of RAM and storage option ranging from 32GB to up to 256GB. The smartphone comes with a 23-megapixel Sony IMX318 rear camera, with usual Tango sensors for motion tracking and depth sensing. The main camera also supports TriTech+ autofocus system, dual-PDAF, second-gen Laser Focus, and continuous focus. The rear camera supports 4-axis OIS (optical image stabilisation) as well as 3-axis EIS (electronic image stabilisation) for video recording alongside support for 4K video recording. The device comes with an 8-megapixel front camera and is backed by a 3,300mAh battery. The smartphone runs on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat and supports Hi-Res Audio, DTS virtual surround sound, and a 5-magnet speaker.

Google would then compensate the advertisers with the money provided by the users of this service. The latest installment of Google contributor, features a new product called Funding Choices, which allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. The new site for Google Contributor, which is now live, offers various insights on how Funding Choices actually works. Each page without ads that is viewed by the user costs a little bit of money, which is $0.01. Assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 “Contributor Pass” to start out with. This seems to be reasonable enough, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. So far only 12 sites are participating in the program, including Business Insider UK, Eurogamer, and Popular Mechanics. Funding Choices is rolling out to North America, the UK, Germany, Australia and New Zealand, with more countries gaining access later this year. Google also confirmed that it will be joining an Ad filter feature on Google Chrome, early in 2018. Google is also launching its own version of an ad-blocker, threatening to block adverts on websites that do not meet the standards developed by the Coalition for Better Ads, such as pop-ups or videos that play with sound or flashing lights.

The doodle shows the iconic actor in different emotions, her faces making up the two O’s of Google. What stands out is her eyes, hard to forget for her fans. Nutan was born in 1936 and passed away in 1991.   An article from our archives states how celebrated the actor was in her era: An article from our archives, from February 18, 2016, states how celebrated the actor was, even being a star of the black and white era: Nutan was the eldest daughter of Kumarsen and Shobana Samarth. Educated in Europe, she imbibed the influences of both Indian and Western cultures. Tall and elegant, she was a photographer’s delight. According to late Subrata Mitra, a cinematographer acclaimed for his work in Satyajit Ray’s Apu trilogy, Nutan appeared photogenic from every angle. Nutan became an icon on a par with Meena Kumari, Nargis and Geeta Bali. Nutan started her career in ‘Hamari Beti’ along with younger sister Tanuja. Films such as ‘Baarish,’ ‘Paying Guest,’ ‘Anari’ and ‘Chalia’ established her as a top actress. In ‘Seema,’ ‘Sone ki chidiya,’ ‘Sujata’ and ‘Bandini,’ she showcased her acting prowess. Though popular as the ‘Queen of emotions,’ she was equally effective in breezy musicals and comedies such as ‘Dilli ka thug,’ ‘Dil hi to hai’ and ‘Tere ghar ke samne.’ She had acted with a number of male stars including Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Ashok Kumar, Sunil Dutt, Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra. Nutan was a gifted singer and brilliantly rendered the number ‘Aye mere humsafar’ in ‘Chabilee’ and also sang in ‘Mayuri.’ Also Read Star of the black and white era   Post a Comment More In Internet Movies Related Articles << Previous Story Now, a full-fledged feature film on jallikattu protests Next Story >> Vicky Kaushal to star opposite Alia in Meghna Gulzar’s next Please Wait while comments are loading...

Alexa now supports reminders and named timers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 10:28am PDTJun 3, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares154 News It has been a little over 200 days since the Google Home was officially released, and owners are still waiting on Google to implement support for reminders. Perhaps in response to the growing competition, Amazon has been hard at work improving Alexa, and has now added reminders and named timers to the assistant. The reminders work pretty much as you would expect - asking "remind me to take out the trash Sunday night" will prompt your Alexa-powered device to notify you when the time comes. The named timers can be created with phrases like, "Set an oven timer for 10 minutes." Amazon only explicitly mentioned the Echo in the announcement, so it's possible these features are limited to Amazon's own devices for now and could require a software update for others (I don't have an Alexa device to test). It also seems to be limited to the United States at the time of writing, for some reason. Tags alexa amazon assistant named timers reminders timers subscribe ...

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 129 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares221 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both. Merlyn Nak-nak Clemente Ich bin der Mann der euch das Angstspürren spüren läst.meine Frau ist mir scheiss egal.meine kinder sind mir wischtiger erptastic k. Artem Russakovskii Went live for me today. Finally no more inviting my wife to all the stuff we do together. Peter I'm too lazy to check, but i assume this isn't available to G Suite accounts? Peter To answer my own question, yeah GSuite not supported. keithzg Yeah, but you have Hangouts Chat whereas we all know that Hangouts is gonna eventually stop working for the rest of us, so it all balances out ;) Deborahthampton Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Grey I really hope we all get Hangouts Chat. It's not live for anyone yet, but I really hope it replaces regular Hangouts. It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only I could use it with G Suite. Spy Katcher Google keeps nipping around the edges of actually making something useful like integrating Calendar with Google Home. C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me.

Google Doodle commemorating Nutan "Today's Doodle reflects Nutan's expressive acting style on what would have been her 81st birthday. It was hard to sum up her genius in a single portrait, and so we depicted four distinct expressions," Google said in a statement. The image reflects her expressions as a conflicted murderess from Bandini, the anguished untouchable from Sujata, the hell-raising orphan from Seema — all memorable characters played by Nutan, a celebrated Indian film actress known for communicating complex emotions using only facial expressions and body language rather than dialogue, the statement read. Her faces fill up for the "oo" in Google. Nutan (full name Nutan Samarth Bahl) made her film debut as a child artiste. Her first film was Hamari Beti (1950), directed by her mother Shobhana Samarth. Her sister is the actress Tanuja; Kajol and Tanisha Mukherjee are Nutan's nieces. Nutan tied the knot with Lieutenant-Commander Rajnish Behl in 1959; their son is the actor Monish Behl. An icon of Indian cinema for over four decades, Nutan pioneered powerful women-centric films in an age when male actors dominated the silver screen. Nutan. YouTube Nutan's illustrious career in films spanned performances in critically acclaimed and commercially successful projects like Sone Ki Chidiya (1958), Sujata (1959), Bandini (1963), Milan (1967), Saraswatichandra (1968), Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki (1978) and Meri Jung (1985). Her pairing with Dev Anand proved to be a hit one — the duo starred together in Paying Guest (1957), Baarish (1957), Manzil (1960) and Tere Ghar Ke Samne (1963). Over her career, her distinct, groundbreaking style helped solidify an award-winning legacy. With an illustrious career spanning over four decades, Nutan won the Filmfare Award six times - Best Actress for a record five times which she incidentally shares with her niece Kajol, and Best Supporting Actress for Meri Jung. She was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian honour of India in 1974. She passed away on 21 February 1991 at the age of 54 after suffering from breast cancer.

Baker died March 31 this year. “Today we celebrate Gilbert Baker’s pride, creativity, and the lasting impact he’s had on strengthening and uniting people all over the world,” Google wrote. Read: Twitter Reacts To Ivanka Trump Supporting LGBT Community After She Wished For A “Joyful” Pride 2017 Apart from the U.S., the doodle appeared on Google's homepage in most South American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Chile. European countries such as Germany, Spain, Hungary and Greece could view it on the search engine's homepage. In Asia, only Japan and South Korea could view the doodle. Baker was born in Chanute, Kansas, in 1951 and grew up in Parsons. He designed the rainbow flag in 1978 in a bid to replace an earlier symbol for gay pride — a pink triangle. This was the symbol the Nazis used to mark people sent to concentration camps for being homosexuals. Baker’s rainbow flag widely became the symbol of LGBT rights causes and a symbol of gay pride. “We needed something beautiful, something from us,” Baker said during a 2015 interview with the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. “The rainbow is so perfect because it really fits our diversity in terms of race, gender, ages, all of those things. Plus, it’s a natural flag — it’s from the sky!” he added. The flag’s original colors were hot pink, red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, indigo, and violet. They represented sex, life, healing, the sun, serenity with nature, art, harmony, and spirit respectively. Now, the modern day flag comprises of only six colors. Despite the changes, Baker remained proud of his work. “Together, we’re changing our world, our planet, from a place of hate and violence and war to a place of love and diversity and acceptance,” he said in 2009. “That is why we’re here. That’s the big, long rainbow — from before me to well after me,” he added. Baker came out as gay at the age of 19. “[Gay] people were psychopaths, criminals. I was afraid my family would lock me up and give me electroshock. I was a screaming queen,” he told the Miami Herald in 2013. “My parents didn’t talk to me for ten years, but it allowed me to get past my own suicidal urges, it allowed me to become the artist that was inside of me and it allowed me to say - Well, you know, I can have a dream and I can go for it,” Baker said in an interview with Refinery29  in June 2015. After leaving the army, he found a home in the LGBT community in San Francisco. “For me and, really, a whole generation of people, that was really a defining time,” Baker said in an interview with ​New York Times in 2008. Baker died in his sleep March 31 at his residence in New York City. Doctors revealed hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to be the cause of his death.

Apple CEO Tim Cook. (Photo: Apple) Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference starts Monday in San Jose. Here are a few of the areas we’ll be watching closely. Siri Speaker: Will Apple challenge Amazon’s Echo? The possibility of a “Siri Speaker” is one of the biggest rumors coming into the event. The general consensus is that Apple needs to expand its virtual assistant into this growing area, possibly with the help of its Beats brand and technology. Apple would be challenging not just Amazon but also Google, with its Google Home line of smart speakers. Google made an interesting move of its own last month, expanding its Google Assistant to iPhone. One question is whether Apple’s speaker would have a screen, possibly along the lines of the new Amazon Echo Show. Given the number of times that Siri currently returns web results in response to inquiries on iOS, a screen might be critical unless the virtual assistant is getting a major upgrade. Which leads to our next big area of interest … Artificial Intelligence: We heard hints of Apple’s ambitions in AI from Carlos Guestrin, Apple director of machine learning, in an interview in February. He said the key to creating an emotional connection between user and device is “the intelligence that it has — how much it understands me, how much it can predict what I need and what I want, and how valuable it is at being a companion to me. … AI is going to be at the core of that.” Hear GeekWire's Todd Bishop discuss this story Monday in the noon hour on The Record on KUOW, 94.9 FM in the Seattle region, and kuow.org.Guestrin is the University of Washington computer science professor who joined Apple with his team following the tech giant’s acquisition of their machine learning startup Turi last year. Apple has established an engineering center in Seattle focused in part on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked about the importance of expanding artificial intelligence and machine learning across the company’s products. Some subtle examples of machine learning include facial recognition in the iOS Photos app and the ability to automatically identify where someone parks a car in Apple Maps. At WWDC, chances are that new AI features would come as part of iOS 11, which is expected to be unveiled at the event. Bloomberg News reports that Apple is also working on a chip to power artificial intelligence in its devices. New Hardware: This isn’t the event where Apple typically shows the next iPhone, but you never know. More widely expected at WWDC is a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, fitting in between the current 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models, with upgraded specs and hardware. Although tablet sales have been declining overall, it’s a competitive market: Microsoft, for one, recently unveiled its new Surface Pro. On a personal note, I’m looking forward to seeing if the rumors of a refreshed MacBook Pro are true. My current MacBook Pro is on its last legs, and my only question is whether to choose a new model or take advantage of what will likely be lower prices on last year’s MacBook Pros. Or, as a total wild card, maybe I’ll wait for the new Surface Laptop to come out from Microsoft in a couple weeks.

Speaker What Australian Scientists Say About Trump's Paris Climate Deal Decision How To Turn Your Old Android Into A Google Pixel Clone Eric Ravenscraft Jun 4, 2017, 11:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android google google pixel mobile smartphones Share Eight months on, and Google Pixel is still one of the best Android smartphones on the market. This is in large part due to innovative software features like Assistant and inbuilt unlimited cloud storage for photos and video. If you're still using an older handset, you can get most of the Pixel's big, best features with a few clever tweaks. Install Google Assistant on Your Current Phone Google Assistant is the headlining feature of the Pixel range. You can also use it on the Google Home speaker and Google's messaging app Allo. It really shines on a phone where it can scan what you're reading to find contextually-relevant information, give you a daily briefing on your way to work and take down reminders or find things around you. So, it's a little weird that Google locked it to a single phone. Fortunately, if you're comfortable with the rooting your phone or flashing .zips, you can get it on any phone running Marshmallow or higher. We've put together an in-depth guide here that walks you through the steps. The technique involves tricking your device into identifying as a Pixel XL instead of whichever model you have. Fortunately, this shouldn't affect day-to-day usage of your device. It's unclear if Google will continue to allow this workaround for long, but for now you can enjoy Assistant without having to get a whole new phone. Roll Your Own Unlimited Photo and Video Storage When Pixel launched, it was priced at a relatively expensive $1079. It's since fallen in price but will still set you back well over $800. To soothe that wound in your wallet, Google throws in free, unlimited, full-size photo storage for life for any photos you take with your Pixel, unlike the resolution-clipped unlimited storage you can already get with Google Photos. That's a pretty huge deal, since most photo backup services have some pretty big caveats. If you don't mind making a couple sacrifices, though, you can roll your own nearly unlimited photo storage. Here are some of the most popular cloud services, and how you can put them to use, no new phone required: Google Photos: Even if you don't buy a Pixel, Google will let you upload an unlimited amount of photos and videos with just one catch: They have to be less than 16 megapixels for photos or 1080p for videos. For most people, that's probably good enough, though you may want to be able to record video in 4K, even if you don't have a 4K TV. Flickr: With Flickr, you can save up to 1TB of photos and videos at their full resolution. 1TB isn't a lot, but it's a handy backup if you're hitting the limit on the other two. Dropbox: Nearly everyone has a Dropbox account already, so you may as well use it to backup your photos. Dropbox can automatically upload any photo or video to your account, regardless of its size. Your space can be fairly limited, but fortunately there are plenty of ways to get more. Between these three, you can probably backup just about anything. Your library will be a little disjointed, but you won't need to spring for a new phone just to back up everything you need. You can also use IFTTT to make it easier to manage multiple backup locations. IFTTT's Android channel can automatically upload photos you take to any cloud backup location. If you want to get more complex, you can use Tasker and IFTTT together to upload to a different service based on which folder you store pictures in. You can also build your own NAS storage to backup as many photos and videos as you have hard drive space for, instead of relying on another company to do it for you. Google's unlimited backup might be convenient, but it's far from your only option. Beef Up Your Photos and Shoot Better Video The camera on the Pixel is pretty impressive. Unfortunately, there's no app to change the hardware on your phone. Before you spend a ton of money on a new phone with a better camera, learn how to use the one you have first and unlock its best features. You can download the Google Camera app to get some of its coolest features like HDR or smart burst mode. While it's not compatible with every device, you can find APKs to install from APK Mirror here. If you want even more control over your photos or Google Camera doesn't work on your device, check out Camera ZOOM FX, one of our favourite camera alternatives for Android. It comes with a ton of advanced features like RAW support, burst shot modes and a ton of photo presets. It also has all of the tools to help you be a better photographer and learn how to compose and take better photos, no matter what camera you have — and sometimes that's what's important. You can even tweak the ISO, exposure, shutters speed and focus distance to get the perfect shot. Use Gestures and Quick Links to Make Your Home Screen More Useful In Android 7.1 you can long-press a shortcut on the home screen to find quick links to features within the app itself. For example, if you hold down the Google Maps icon, you can quickly navigate to home or work. This feature is being rolled out to everyone, but if your phone can't handle the OS update, try our favourite home screen replacement Nova Launcher Prime ($5.99). With this app installed, you can assign a shortcut to any icon on your home screen. We'll demonstrate by adding a navigation shortcut to Google Maps: If there isn't one already, add a Maps shortcut to your home screen. Long-press the app icon and tap Edit in the pop-up menu. Tap the "Swipe action" drop-down. Tap the Shortcuts tab along the top of the screen. Scroll down and tap Directions. Enter a destination address, like your home. Give it a name like "Navigate Home". Tap Save. Tap Done. Now, swipe up on the Maps icon on your home screen. This should immediately launch the Navigation feature of Google Maps with your home address already entered. This isn't quite the same as Android 7.1's feature, since you can only have one shortcut at a time. On the other hand, you get to customise it, instead of settling for whatever the developers decide to give you. Download Allo and Duo, Google's Messaging Apps If you visit the Pixel's store page, Google will tell you about apps like Allo and Duo, but they're far from Pixel exclusives. Allo, Google's intelligent messaging app, and Duo, its dead-simple 1-to-1 video chat app, are available on the Play Store for any compatible device. While Allo still needs some refinement, having Assistant built-in makes it a compelling alternative to other chat apps. Meanwhile, Duo is like a cross-platform Facetime, bringing easy video calls to both Android and iPhone users. Best of all, there's no need to buy a new phone just to try these out. Add a Reboot Button We're not sure why Google decided to wait until version 7.1 to bring back the reboot option to the Android power menu, but at least it's back. If your phone has yet to receive the 7.1 update, you can get it with Material Power Menu. This app works with or without root to give you a handy menu that lets you turn your phone off, reboot it or even boot into recovery or the bootloader. Without root, you can launch the app from a shortcut on your home screen, which is still pretty convenient. It will launch a simple screen with several power options available. If all you want is an easy way to reboot your phone, this is all you'll need. However, if you have root and Xposed, it will also automatically activate whenever you hold down your power button. It's a little thing, but if you constantly need to restart your phone, it can make a huge difference.

Why invest all those millions of dollars making the assistant for only a handful of people. Reply 0 cabooselololol @cabooselololol Jun 4, 2017, 2:09pm My S8 Plus has it I think? (and it's not that Bixby), holding the Home Button presents a pretty much same looking Google Assistant. Not sure if its the same (and it's also most likely limited). But I do believe its also on newer phones. Reply 0 ravennoir @ravennoir Jun 5, 2017, 11:38am I didnt realise this, just checked it on my S8 and it works. Thanks :) Reply 0 derpfactory @derpfactory Jun 4, 2017, 6:26pm I thought I had previously seen articles saying it was available for all phones but I can't find any without requiring root. Baffling.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Google’s new IoT Core service helps businesses manage their IoT data and devices Posted May 16, 2017 by Ron Miller (@ron_miller) 0 SHARES Next Story Houzeo simplifies the process of selling your home Google Cloud launched a new Internet of Things management service today called Google Cloud IoT Core that provides a way for companies to manage IoT devices and process data being generated by those devices. A transportation or logistics firm, for example, could use this service to collect data from its vehicles and combine it with other information like weather, traffic and demand to place the right vehicles at the right place at the right time. By making this into a service, Google is not only keeping up with AWS and Microsoft, which have similar services, it is tapping into a fast-growing market. In fact, a Google Cloud spokesperson said the genesis of this service wasn’t so much about keeping up with its competitors — although that’s clearly part of it — it was about providing a service its cloud customers were increasingly demanding. That’s because more and more companies are dealing with tons of data coming from devices large and small, whether a car or truck or tiny sensors sitting on an MRI machine or a machine on a manufacturer’s shop floor. Just validating the devices, then collecting the data they are generating is a huge undertaking for companies. Google Cloud IoT Core is supposed to help deal with all of that by removing a level of complexity associated with managing all of these devices and data. By packaging this as a service, Google is trying to do a lot of the heavy lifting for customers, providing them with the infrastructure and services they need to manage the data, using Google’s software services like Google Cloud Dataflow, Google BigQuery, and Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine. Customers can work with third-party partners like ARM, Intel and Sierra Wireless for their IoT hardware and Helium, Losant or Tellmeplus for building their applications. Photo: Google Cloud   While the company bills itself as the more open alternative to competitors like AWS and Microsoft Azure, this IoT service is consistent with Google’s overall strategy to let customers use both its core cloud services and whatever other services they choose to bring to the process, whether they are from Google itself or from a third party. Related Articles The solution consists of two main pieces. First there is a device manager for registering each of the “things” from which you will be collecting data. This can be done manually through a console or programmatically to register the devices in a more automated fashion, which is more likely in scenarios involving thousands or even tens of thousands of devices. As Google describes it, the device manager establishes the identity of a device and provides a mechanism for authenticating it as it connects to the cloud, while maintaining a configuration for each device that helps the Google Cloud service recognize it. The second piece is a “protocol bridge,” which provides a way to communicate using standard protocols between the “things” and the Google Cloud service. It includes native support for secure connection over MQTT, an industry-standard IoT protocol, according to the company. Once the device is registered and the data is moved across the protocol bridge, it can flow through processing and eventually visualization or use in an application.

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 129 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares221 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both. Merlyn Nak-nak Clemente Ich bin der Mann der euch das Angstspürren spüren läst.meine Frau ist mir scheiss egal.meine kinder sind mir wischtiger erptastic k. Artem Russakovskii Went live for me today. Finally no more inviting my wife to all the stuff we do together. Peter I'm too lazy to check, but i assume this isn't available to G Suite accounts? Peter To answer my own question, yeah GSuite not supported. keithzg Yeah, but you have Hangouts Chat whereas we all know that Hangouts is gonna eventually stop working for the rest of us, so it all balances out ;) Deborahthampton Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Grey I really hope we all get Hangouts Chat. It's not live for anyone yet, but I really hope it replaces regular Hangouts. It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only I could use it with G Suite. Spy Katcher Google keeps nipping around the edges of actually making something useful like integrating Calendar with Google Home. C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me. (Grumble Grumble) Tv One feature I'd like to see with this is the ability to disable individual family members on specific Google products. For example, we have the grandparents as part of our family group. The "Family Group" sharing is useful for Play Music and Photos, but they don't need to be part of shared Keep and Calendar items.

Speaker What Australian Scientists Say About Trump's Paris Climate Deal Decision Make Your Own Bootleg HoloLens With The Cardboard Holokit Rhett Jones Jun 4, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  augmented reality cardboard clips gadgets holokit hololens Share While the world catches up with VR, imperfect but affordable options for entry like Google Cardboard and Samsung's Gear VR will get the job done. But augmented/mixed reality is also proving itself to be a ripe new field and for anyone looking to dip their toes in the water of this brave new world, the Holokit has come to save the day. Image: Fengyuan Zhu Google's VR Headset Is So Comfortable I Never Want To Take It Off It isn't the games that really wow me when I slip on the Daydream View VR headset. It isn't the worlds that the Google Maps app allow me to visit. It isn't even the immediate sensation of wonder that VR still instills me. It's how comfortable the headset is. Read more Like Google Cardboard, the Holokit uses a cardboard frame to house a smartphone. Two mirrors reflect what appears on your smartphone onto an angled Fresnel lens. Unlike Google Cardboard, you want to see through this setup because you're mixing reality with imagery coming from your phone. Unfortunately, like Cardboard, there's no headstrap. But you can always make your own. Open source tracking software will be released on GitHub along with the headset on June 6, 2017. Amber Garage is a startup focused on augmented reality. Its founder Botao Hu showed off the little DIY kit this week at the Augmented World Expo. A price hasn't been announced yet but it seems reasonable to say it will cost more than the $US15 ($20) that Google Cardboard does and less than the $US100 ($134) or so that headsets like Gear VR go for. Checking out the video demonstration, it's safe to say that this will be a big step down from an actual Hololens but the lowest tier development kits for that device for $US3000 ($4031). It's hard to say if what you see is going to look totally bootleg or if it's just tough to capture with a camera. Probably a little of both. Regardless, I like the low-res vibe. This is a perfect way for developers to tinker around with the technology without having to make such a major investment. I'm sure the lawyers at the software giant will be taking some issue with that name but Microsoft's developers should seriously consider making one of these themselves. I look forward to playing with all the stuff you guys make for this thing. Check it out for yourself in the video below and it should be available here on June 6.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

But really how smart are a bunch of different devices all speaking different languages? Unfortunately, the smart home can be very stupid and often takes longer to set up than breathless advertisements imply. We're here to tell you how you can build a smart home where everything works in harmony. How Smart Do You Want Your Home to Be? As we've recently noted, not much in the smart home world is truly universal yet, but hardware and software makers are slowly catching on. Devices like the Chromecast, Sonos speakers, and Eero routers simplify setups that were once painfully complicated — only people of a certain age will ever appreciate how magical it is to tap a button and have video instantly beamed from smartphone to television. A good starting point is to work out whether you want to dabble in the smart home scene or go all-in with your automation, and we've covered both choices below. Going device by device is easier and cheaper, but can get messy and prove hard to upgrade; committing to one platform and hub is more limiting for now but may pay off later down the line. While we'll do our best to guide you towards a kit that's compatible, and explain the competing standards out there right now, the truth is we're not yet at the stage where everything in the Internet of Things speaks happily to everything else — that's still a way off. You can either automate a lot around the home, and control everything separately, or go through one central hub, and take what you get. The Coolest Smart Home Innovations In 2017 There's an abundance of amazing home smart tech hitting the market. From Samsung's Family Hub 2.0 fridge to the Amazon Alexa and Google Home (hopefully) finally hitting our shores. But there's more to the smart home than gadgets. Let's take a look at how home automation and new tech like Tesla battery storage, smart thermostats, grid credits and smart meters are revolutionising our power consumption. Which also has a positive impact on both the environment and our bank accounts. Read more Image: Gizmodo Taking a piecemeal approach Image: LIFX We've mentioned that individual aspects of the smart home is slowly improving, and if you're buying a one-off device, chances are you're going to be very impressed: buy an Amazon Echo, or a Nest thermostat, or a Philips Hue lightbulb, and you can add a little intelligence to your humble home in minutes. You can even rig something up yourself. Thanks to the ubiquitous Wi-Fi most of us now enjoy, getting devices online and connected is easier than ever, which means mobile control from the palm of our hands is pretty straightforward. You can get smart locks, smart lights, smart fridges, and more besides, and generally speaking, the user experience is getting up to somewhere near a respectable standard after several years of hits and misses. The benefits of making one-off additions to your smart home are that everything should just work the first time, and you can keep costs down too. Focus on the parts of your house you want to make a little cleverer (like your air conditioner) and leave the rest in blissful ignorance for the time being. Image: Nest The big downsides? Everything in your home has a separate app and nothing works together. You can't dim the lights and slide down the blinds, or open your garage and unlock the door, or do anything else at the same time and in the same app without embracing one of the (fledgling) platforms out there. There are workarounds, but they are just that: workarounds. Our favourite is the Field Guide regular IFTTT (If This Then That). It can tie together different smart home gadgets with impressive skill. It can do tricks like getting your Echo to talk to your Nest or keeping your lights and heating in sync, but it's not ideal for building an overarching system. Yet it's still another layer of complexity and another app to deal with. All The Cool New Stuff Google Home Can Do Google just announced new updates to Assistant and Google Home. The smart speaker leans on Assistant to offer voice controls and artificially intelligent, well, assistance. But until now, the gadget hasn't really been able to do that much. Thanks to some updates, however, that might change very soon. Read more Choosing a platform Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Throwing everything behind one particular platform will save you from learning the ins and outs of IFTTT or keeping a dozen smart home apps on your phone. Yet none of these platforms are anywhere near perfect yet, which is why many people are sticking with the wait-and-see approach. The easiest way in to embracing a hub is to buy yourself an Amazon Echo or a Google Home and then pick up the rest of your kit based on what else is compatible. The Amazon Echo devices work with gear from the likes of Philips, Belkin, Honeywell, TP-Link and more — in fact, its growing support for third-party apps and products is probably where it's still strongest against Google's rival smart speaker. Google Home hasn't been around as long as the Echo, and it shows in terms of what else works with it (and the companion Google Home app). The list of working smart home products is less impressive than Amazon's. Though there are still some major mainstays. Manufacturers like Philips and Belkin have recently joined the Google party, and Nest and Dropcam devices work, but they're both now subsidiaries of Google. Which Virtual Butler Will Command The Servants In Your Smart Home? With Belkin's WeMo gadgets finally set to take orders from Apple's Siri, the smart home giants are vying for the coveted position of household butler – acting as liaison between the lord of the manor and your digital servants. Read more Image: Apple Apple HomeKit, meanwhile, has been with us since 2014 but is still waiting for its breakthrough moment. There's no always listening speaker to use, so you're stuck with your iPad, iPhone or Apple TV for controlling everything. Yet the number of gadgets with the works-with-HomeKit badge continues to grow and grow, and few smart home platforms offer the simplicity and ease-of-use of Apple's app. If you don't want Apple, Google, or Amazon running your smart home, then SmartThings (now owned by Samsung) is another option. It's the most comprehensive out there at the moment, with a plethora of supported devices, from SmartThings brand sensors and switches to third-party kits from the usual smart home suspects like Philips, Belkin, Netgear, and Ecobee. It even offers integration with both the Amazon Echo or Google Home. Yet set up can be almost as bothersome as the IFTTT solution. So SmartThings isn't recommended if you don't have a full afternoon set aside for getting things going. Wink is a direct rival to SmartThings and has a list of compatible devices and services that are just as impressive. As with SmartThings, you can hook Wink gear up with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, and everything is handled with one central hub. We haven't had the best of experiences with Wink in the past, but we're prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt and imagine it's got better over the last couple of years. Plus, as we've already said, no smart home platform is perfect right now. Other platforms are available, but we'd suggest sticking to those five options for now, even if it's hard to predict which way the smart home market will turn next. In a lot of ways it's down to who you trust to make the best software, sign the best deals and attract the most developers in the next few years — and then you'll really have a smart home to be proud of. Smart Home Devices That Will Save You Time, Money And Energy To say I'm a fan of smart homes is an understatement. Being a renter I'm limited somewhat as to what I can have in my apartment, but that hasn't stopped me from integrating as many smart devices into my environment as humanly possible. One thing I've discovered a long the way — not only have I saved a lot of effort (regular light switches are for plebs, you guys), but I've saved time, money and kilowatts on my energy bill. Here's my top recommendations for doing the same at your place.

How The Promise Of The NBN Fell Short For So Many Australians Tooran Alizadeh 05 Jun 2017 11:15 AM Eight years into the Australian government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) project, the nation has an average internet speed – 50th in the global rankings – that lags well behind many advanced economy countries. Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter? Subscribe Alert me about competitions & deals Have a tip?

Using this website, you will be able to easily create a GIF by drawing a comparison between two different data sets. To draw a data comparison, all you got to do is enter two data points, add data titles, choose a different color for each data, and enter the explanatory text for both the data. You can also decide whether you want to show the data evaluation in “percentage” or “addition”. After that, you can simply play the data comparison online or download it as an animated GIF. Ultimately, you can use this website to show your simple data in a more visually appealing way with the help of an animated GIF. Sponsored Links Google has been developing some simple, useful, and interesting web applications like AutoDraw, A Google A Day, and more. And this time they have come up with “Data GIF Maker” to help you visualize your simple data comparison in an animated GIF. The best part of this website is that it doesn’t restrict you to any specific type of data, which also means the data comparison can be drawn between anything like search percentage of two keywords, population of two countries, the popularity of two superheroes, critic rating of two movies, fat burning capability of two foods, and so on. How to Create an Animated GIF of Data using this Data Visualization Website by Google: To get started, simply visit the homepage of Data GIF maker. After that, you will see a comparison widget where the first thing you need to do is enter the title for both the data. After entering the titles, you can proceed and enter the data points for both data in the “Values” input field. You can enter a single value or multiple values (separated by commas) for each data if you want. When you’re done entering the data points, simply enter the explanatory text for both data in the “Data Sample” input field on the widget. You can enter any text you like. As an example, I will enter the explanatory text as “Software Reviews”. Now, you can change the color code of both data such that they can be easily identified on the animated GIF. To change the color code, simply click on the circular “Color” icon at the top of each data. After that, you will be able to choose between 4 different colors (red, blue, yellow, and green). These are actually the colors which comprise the Google logo :). At last, you can decide whether you want to show the data evaluation in “percentage” or “addition”. For this, you can select the “Percentage” or the “Addition” icons on the right of the comparison widget. Now, your data comparison will be ready and you can either play it online or download it as an animated GIF file. To play the data comparison online, simply click on the “Launch Comparisons” button at the top right corner. This will open a new window where you can play the data comparison by pressing “Spacebar” or enable the “Autoplay” option on the widget for playing it automatically. If you want to download the data comparison as animated GIF, then click on the “Download as GIF” button. After that, it will ask whether you want to download a low-resolution GIF or a high-resolution GIF. When you select either option, it will start rendering your GIF and in a minute or two, you will get your animated GIF.

Allo in particular has been getting a lot of attention lately from Google, and this time it’s getting a Selfie Clips feature for capturing and sharing your personal GIF. The new feature was announced by Allo’s head of product Amit Fulay, who said that Selfie Clips will be added to the chat app for users to share their personal GIF. Fulay confirmed this in a tweet during the week. Softpedia reports that the new Selfie Clips feature will allow you to capture and share your own personal GIFs with your friends and loved ones on Allo. Explaining how the feature works, Fulay said Allo users who receive a sticker can emulate it with their own face. Next step is to select the GIF option under the “+” menu and record your own short clip that looks like the sticker previously received by you. After recording the short clip, Google Allo moves on to automatically loop the video and put it into GIF form. Finally, you can share the GIF with your friends and loved ones. By now, every iOS and Android users must have received the new feature, and perhaps, started sharing their own GIFs with their friends and family. Not done with adding the Selfie Clips feature, Google has also redesigned the compose bar in the chat app. Some users, according to Softpedia have already started noticing the new ways to share content, which is faster than normal. The Selfie Clips feature uses neural network to create personalized selfie sticks for users. Google also collaborated with various artists to make the stickers more attractive to users. Before launching the feature, the Mountain View California-based tech giant tested it among human raters. Talking about neural network, last April, Google rolled out an exciting feature that will turn all your selfies into cartoon stickers. The method will involve using machine learning and neural networks to map out your facial features to animated versions designed by popular artist Lamar Abrams, a storyboard artist, writer, and designer for the popular Cartoon Network series Steven Universe. Once designed, you can then go ahead to customize the cartoon stickers to suit your taste. The whole idea behind the new feature is explained in details by Google on its research blog. Google’s approach will be to first explore how it could enable an algorithm to pick out some basic features in a particular manner from your image. The new tool is integrated into the Allo chat app, and can be located when you pull up the list of stickers you can use to respond to conversations where you will find an option: “Turn a selfie into stickers.” Once you tap this option, it prompts you to take a selfie. From there and then, Google’s image-recognition algorithms will analyze your face, and map out your features to the ones in a kit. Got something to add to this story?

Via the official Google blog, the company’s Senior Vice President of Ads and Commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy announced that: “We plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” Chrome is currently the dominant desktop web browser, with around 41.6% market share, and while mobile usage is on the rise, the use of ad blocking is significantly more prominent on desktop (18% vs 1% on mobile, according to the latest Mary Meeker Internet Trends report). Google’s hoping that by addressing user concerns on desktop, they can avoid the rise of ad blockers on mobile devices, while also maintaining more control over the market they rely upon for their revenue. In terms of which ads, specifically, will be penalized, Google’s referring to research conducted by the Coalition for Better Ads, of which they, themselves, are a founding member. As explained by Ramaswarmy: “The vast majority of online content creators fund their work with advertising. That means they want the ads that run on their sites to be compelling, useful and engaging - ones that people actually want to see and interact with. But the reality is, it’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web - like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page. These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads, taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation.” Over the past few years, ad blocking has risen to become the spectre of doom for online marketing - while more and more people are spending more of their time online, ad blocking adoption is also rising. According to research (and combining the above data on mobile and desktop usage), around 11% of all web users now use ad blocking in some form, a rate which has increased 30% year-on-year. And notably, ad blocker adoption rates are increasing steadily in some of the core global markets for the big tech giants. Source: PageFair Adblock report 2017 That’s obviously a huge concern for both Facebook and Google, who collectively capture around 77% of total digital ad spend, where both generate the vast majority of their income. To counter this, Facebook has tried blocking ad blockers on their platform to ensure their ads are still shown, while Google’s sought to penalize pages which provide poor ad experiences, like intrusive pop-ups, amongst various other efforts. Each of these initiatives has generated mixed results - but through their Chrome option, Google may have a more substantial measure to lean on, one which could help it better police ad quality and, in turn, reduce the adoption of ad blockers. As noted, both Google and Facebook are members of The Coalition for Better Ads, which was founded last year in partnership with a group of leading international trade associations and companies involved in online media. The group’s aim is, essentially, to combat the rise of ad blocking by pooling their knowledge and resources in an effort to develop and implement new global standards for online advertising to avoid annoying misuses of ad content. According to Oliver von Wersch, Managing Director of Gruner+Jahr and a member of the Coalition: “The breadth of this Coalition emphasizes our belief that a unified, industry-wide effort will drive the change consumers want.” This is the key impetus for the Coalition’s existence, to formulate a plan to find out what’s driving users to use ad blockers, then eliminating those experiences. And they’re already producing results – back in February, YouTube, which is owned by Google, announced that it would be removing unskippable, 30 second pre-roll ads, one of the more frustrating digital ad offerings. Just last month, Facebook announced that it’s introducing a new measure within its algorithm to reduce the reach of content from sites which are loaded with intrusive ads. While neither of these announcements came as a direct result of the Coalition’s formation, both are linked back to trends and ad content identified by the Coalition’s research as problematic, leading to action. Of course, giving Google control over which ads it will and won’t show also gives them something of a market advantage – they could, for example, start blocking non-Google ads in order to boost the value of their own offerings. That’s an element that regulatory bodies will no doubt be watching, but on balance, the overall impetus and aims for the Chrome blocker make sense, and should help deliver a better user experience. In order to help brands prepare for the coming change, Google has also announced a new Ad Experience Report to help publishers understand how the Better Ads Standards apply to their own websites. The tool provides screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences Google’s systems have identified as problematic, in order to make it easier for publishers to find and fix the issues. Google’s also adding a new initiative called ‘Funding Choices’ which will enable publishers to show a customized message to visitors who are using an ad blocker, inviting them to “either enable ads on their site, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor”. It’ll be interesting to see how those measures are adopted and whether they help improve the user experience. Google’s announcements underline that ad blockers are a serious concern for digital marketing, but also, that the major players have measures they can lean on to limit their use. Right now, at 11% adoption, ad blockers are a concern, but rather than neuter them entirely, Google and Facebook are looking at the underlying issues, the problems that lead to the use of blockers in the first place, which is a much more sustainable and productive approach. And if they can get rid of those intrusive, over the top ads, the web will be a better place for it. Google’s Chrome ad blocker will be released ‘early in 2018’. Funding Choices is now available to publishers in North America, U.K., Germany, Australia and New Zealand, and will be rolling out in other countries later this year.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Alexa now supports reminders and named timers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 10:28am PDTJun 3, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares154 News It has been a little over 200 days since the Google Home was officially released, and owners are still waiting on Google to implement support for reminders. Perhaps in response to the growing competition, Amazon has been hard at work improving Alexa, and has now added reminders and named timers to the assistant. The reminders work pretty much as you would expect - asking "remind me to take out the trash Sunday night" will prompt your Alexa-powered device to notify you when the time comes. The named timers can be created with phrases like, "Set an oven timer for 10 minutes." Amazon only explicitly mentioned the Echo in the announcement, so it's possible these features are limited to Amazon's own devices for now and could require a software update for others (I don't have an Alexa device to test). It also seems to be limited to the United States at the time of writing, for some reason. Tags alexa amazon assistant named timers reminders timers subscribe ...

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Alexa, set guitar reminder for one minute" -- it just gives you an alarm. "Alexa, set reminder for one minute" - Alexa says, "What's the reminder for?" I say, "Guitar". 1 minute later, "Here's your reminder -- guitar." MrCalifornia Can't say I like having to give two inputs every single time. I only use multiple timers like 2% of the time.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology Google co-founder Sergey Brin reportedly building $100 million 'air yacht' to help the poor David Paul Morris / Bloomberg Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet and co-founder of Google, speaks at the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford University in 2016. Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet and co-founder of Google, speaks at the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford University in 2016. (David Paul Morris / Bloomberg) Hamza ShabanThe Washington Post Google co-founder Sergey Brin is spending more than $100 million to build the world's largest airship, a blimp with a rigid structure designed to both deliver supplies abroad for humanitarian projects and ferry Brin's family and friends around the globe, the Guardian newspaper reported. The project is the latest example of Silicon Valley attempting to reshape how goods and people are moved. But some say it also underscores a penchant for tech moguls to color their projects with seemingly virtuous ambition. Some people on social media seized on the vessel's apparent dual purpose. On the one hand, it's a benevolent carrier transporting food to remote, hard-pressed communities, and on the other it's a luxurious "air yacht," as the Guardian report described it, shuttling a billionaire and his inner circle to exotic locations. Google declined to comment. The vessel is reportedly being built at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. When completed, the airship will become the world's largest aircraft at about 650 feet long, although its payload is not known, according to the Guardian. Plans for the vessel, which is being funded by Brin, were first reported by Bloomberg earlier this year. Experts say that the use of airships could bypass the congestion and costs tied to transporting cargo via roads, railways and airports. But lighter-than-air travel presents its own challenges, like the need to steady the aircraft by offsetting the weight of cargo once it's offloaded. According to the Guardian, Brin's vessel will use a series of internal bladders to stabilize its flight. Brin began his plans to build the vessel about three years ago, according to Bloomberg. His fascination with airships was sparked by visits to the Ames Research Center, next to the headquarters of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Ames once housed the navy airship USS Macon, which spanned about 784 feet and was among the largest aircraft of its time in the 1930s. Silicon Valley's novel charitable efforts have been criticized in the past, perhaps most prominently in the case of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's internet.org initiative, which aims to bring Internet access to the billions of people who don't have it. With altruistic motives but lucrative business prospects, some see Zuckerberg's initiative less as a magnanimous Internet project than as a version of high-tech imperialism. It's unclear whether Brin's airship will be put to commercial use. But Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet and the other co-founder of Google, has also taken a keen interest in innovative aircraft. Page has personally backed two flying-car start-ups, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. Kitty Hawk's flyer, a personal electric aircraft that hovers over water, will be available for purchase later this year.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before... After six months time during this work and also i obtained compensated for totally 36 thousand us dollars...

"Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads. Take your stupid large fake green buttons outta here, filths :3 Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

These are some of our favourites for when you've got five minutes or five hours to waste. Atari Breakout Image: Screenshot Run a Google image search for "Atari breakout" and you're met with a version of the classic game you can play in your browser. Use the cursor keys as controllers. The classic Google search page Point your browser at https://archive.google.com/heart to relive your youth with the classic Google search page. It still works, but the results page is the modern version. Are you feeling lucky? Click I'm Feeling Lucky on Google with nothing in the search bar and you're given a random Google link to try — it could be anything from mini puzzles to charity drives. Pac-Man Image: Screenshot Atari Breakout isn't the only game that gets a Google Easter Egg spin. The 2010 Google Doodle version of the classic title, Pac-Man, can be brought back with a simple Google search for "pac-man". Search box tricks Image: Screengrab Several Google searches give entertaining results. Some of our favourites? Try entering "do a barrel roll", "google in 1998", "askew", "<blink>", or "sonic the hedgehog." Search box tools These Eggs aren't really hidden surprises, more useful tools. You can run Google searches for "flip a coin" or "roll a die" to do just that, or use "timer" or "stopwatch" for those apps. Solitaire Image: Screenshot You're still after another game aren't you? Typing "solitaire" into Google gives you a web version of the classic card game. If you don't like cards, try entering "tic tac toe" instead. Bacon numbers Every movie star is less than six steps away from Kevin Bacon and Google can help you prove it — type the name of almost anyone followed by "bacon number" to get the link. Search in pirate or Klingon Google knows more languages than you might have realised: you can load up the search results page to display labels in pirate, Klingon or hacker speak, should you need to. The Loch Ness pegman Normally he's yellow. (Image: Screenshot) Search for "loch ness" on Google Maps and the iconic pegman figure turns into the shape of Scotland's most famous mythical (?) monster. No sightings of the actual Nessie, though. Use the Force, Luke Image: Screenshot The Star Wars scroll Easter Egg has come and gone from YouTube, but this one lives on — enter "use the Force, Luke" as a YouTube search to send the results into flux. Brush up on your trivia Knowledge is power and you can get more of it by searching for "fun facts" on Google. When you've absorbed the information, click Ask Another Question for a new fact. Endless dinosaur running If you find yourself without internet on your smartphone, pass the time by loading up Chrome for iOS or Android and tapping the dinosaur to launch an endless runner. Travel by dragon Image: Screenshot One for the Welsh here. If you choose to navigate from Snowdon to the Brecon Beacons and "dragon" appears as a travel option. Unfortunately, no dragons appear on screen. The Emmett Brown pegman You might have noticed this already, but when you view older imagery in Street View (via the drop-down menu in the top-left corner), the pegman turns into Emmett Brown. Cast spells on Android Call up the Google voice interface on Android via "OK Google" and you can cast a couple of Harry Potter spells: "lumos" to turn on the flashlight and "silencio" to mute all sounds.

The new sites under the ban hammer include YesMovies, Vumoo, LosMovies, CartoonHD, Project Free TV 1, Torlock and 1337x. Here is the full list. How The Promise Of The NBN Fell Short For So Many Australians Tooran Alizadeh 05 Jun 2017 11:15 AM Eight years into the Australian government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) project, the nation has an average internet speed – 50th in the global rankings – that lags well behind many advanced economy countries. Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter? Subscribe Alert me about competitions & deals Have a tip?

The course would eventually earn the name "Search Inside Yourself," attract thousands of Tan's coworkers, and spread across the globe. But back then, it was just a project that Tan pursued in his "20% time," or the time Google gives employees to pursue passions that are unrelated to their core responsibilities but that will benefit the company (whether employees still take advantage is up for debate). Tan recruited a bunch of big names in the space to develop and teach the course, including Norman Fischer, Daniel Goleman, Philippe Goldin, and Mirabai Bush. In those early days, Tan recalled when we spoke recently, they'd meet at Google's Mountain View headquarters and discuss their visions. "Halfway during one of the first meetings," Tan told me, "somebody asked: Is Google paying us for this? I was like, 'How would I know? Why are you asking me?'" (Tan clarified that Google did eventually pay the SIY instructors.) Tan's point here is that he didn't consult all the higher-ups and meticulously plan the logistics of SIY. He felt that, if he could get the program off the ground, it would benefit Googlers — and so he went for it. He explained: "The secret of my success in Google is to always do the right thing for Google and the world. And then I sit back and wait for them to fire me. So if they don't fire me, I've done the right thing for Google and the world. If they do fire me, then I'm in the wrong company. So either way I win." He went on: "This is one of those situations where I just do the right thing and then, if it doesn't work out, just ask for forgiveness." This advice won't work for everyone in every situation, Tan said. But at the time, it helped fuel his success. In 2008, he was offered a job in Google's people operations department so he could lead SIY full-time. After 15 years at Google, Tan retired in 2015. He said he wasn't sure what the culture is like today, but remembered that a lot of his coworkers "wanted to change the world. There was an element of idealism and energy and altruism."

The CFO discussed what she sees as the biggest threat to the dominant business, as well as progress on Fiber, X, and more. Nintendo Switch Porat cites “complacency and not innovating” as the biggest risk to the profitable core Google business, as well as not “investing substantially to continue to evolve what the user experience is and evolve the opportunities for advertisers.” YouTube received several mentions throughout the interview as a promising area, especially growing out the subscription business. The merger of Play Music and YouTube Music was referenced, while YouTube finds original content “really valuable.” Porat highlighted how the Google division is continuing to take an approach that values content creators and their followers. Overall, the YouTube community — as evident during I/O — is seen as very important, with most of Google’s social efforts focused there. Moving to the Other Bets, Porat reiterated that Google Fiber is taking a pause. We have pulled back. We looked at the approach we were taking. We said there’s got to be a better way through technology to meaningfully enhance both deployment and delivery. And we want to pause what we’re doing to see how much we can do with technology before we ramp what we’re doing again. Google’s original vision of laying out fiber didn’t end up making sense and the team with Larry Page’s help is looking at other technology. At the end of the day this isn’t going to be the transformative play that we believe. Let’s spend the time. And Larry’s spending a lot of time with the Fiber team on that. We brought in a great new leader from the industry. We’re excited about the work they are doing. So, that was a pause. X received a few mention, with Porat nothing that it “still exists” as “one of the other bets.” There’s “a lot of innovation and experimentation and moonshots going on within,” especially with robots: “We still have a lot of robotics work that we’re doing within X.” Watch the full interview below: Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Opinion: Google+ isn’t dead, but it is drowning in spam (though it plans to do something about it) Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 10:20am PDTMay 29, 2017 160 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares300 Editorials Google Last month Gideon Rosenblatt did a post on Google+ about the very platform, and it resonated with us here at AP. Many of you may know that we have invested a lot of our time here into Google+. After all, this is Android Police, and Google+ is as much a product of Google as Android is. But, we’ve been disheartened recently by issues with the social network. Most notably, a growing problem with spam. Our own site founder and owner, Artem, spoke out recently about his problems with the platform in the wake of Rosenblatt's post. And his is just one of many posts which have been attracting more attention and discussion on the subject. All of this has even prompted a response from an engineering manager at Google, who says that it is going to make a greater effort to fix things in the future. But spam is just one symptom of the platform's problems. I can't talk about spam without talking about what causes it. Unfortunately, that means I need to beat a bit of a dead horse. A lot of the problems you've heard about the platform in the past are contributing factors. Spam is an indicator of health, and the often-discussed historical problems with Google+ are the diseases. So it might seem that I'm digressing onto a well-worn subject here, but it is important to the discussion. All the old problems From a development perspective, Google has been distancing its social platform from its other tools as much as it can. Photos and Hangouts were once both integral parts of the Google+ experience. But, much as each subsequent update to Google+ has removed or limited features, each year seems to take away integration with another Google service. Hangouts on Air, Google Photos, Shared Circles, location sharing, Google+ Local, with all these things gone it may almost be fair to say that Google+ may have seen more features removed from the service than it has in total at present. Although it was made a part of G Suite last year, it may be a bit too late, and the utility to businesses for the social platform is likely limited. By design or accident, ostracizing Google+ in this way may have resulted in stagnation. Isolation reduces the user count and the number of eyes on content. And that stagnation is a breeding pool for spam. Google’s advocacy for the social platform has also diminished. Many prominent Googlers, as well as people in the core Google+ team, are barely even using the service. If your own employees can’t be motivated to use your product — if not on merit, at least as a means of promoting it — then what sort of attention is being paid to it? Writing here at AP, when I embed social content from Google, it almost always comes from one of two places: Twitter or YouTube. Part of that is because Google posts more things to those platforms than it does to Google+, and that’s a problem. Consider the difference in content volume between the Google Photos Twitter, Google Photos Blog, and Google Photos Google+ account. The last one of those only saw four posts this year. So not only are Googlers not using the platform, Google also recognizes the lack of marketing value for its own self-promotion. And even those few posts made by official Google accounts have had issues with spam. Thankfully in light of the recent attention drawn to the subject, they've been mostly cleaned up. But, if Google's own content has problems with it, imagine what users face. And all the new ones All the other, well-discussed issues have not been enough to prevent Google+ from soldiering on as a niche network. It isn't Facebook (thankfully), or Twitter, but people use it. Adoption may have slowed, and utility might be diminished, but it has a user base. A surprising number of little communities have popped up inside it. Developers with Android apps have been using it as a platform for app communications, beta tests, and technical support. In the realm of Google related software development, the platform is a small but bustling community attached to the larger market. And the people there like it. At least, they like it when the signal to noise ratio remains high enough to drown out the spam. To be fair, one can't claim this is a problem exclusive to Google+. All social media platforms have problems with spam, it’s basically a rule. As the barriers to mass communication become lower on a given platform, the quantity of submitted content that is used for marketing purposes increases. It becomes a delicate balance. How easy can you make account creation before every account is a bot? How easy should comment removal or reporting be so that spam can be caught, but censorship isn’t abused? What sort of burden can be placed on users, and how much responsibility for policing content can be delegated? Given the widespread nature of spam on most high-profile Google+ posts, this particular balance may need some adjustment. Some of the recent changes to Google+ have also increased the proliferation of spam. A lot of the older functionality that made managing content easier was stripped out in the responsive redesign of 2015-2016. Although the new site is more performant and consumes much less data, it also has a lot fewer methods of user interaction with content. Every post view is now a click, and comments must either be scrolled or each post opened in a new window, both of which make reporting content that little bit harder. Increasing the number of barriers for finding and reporting spam makes each post its own little breeding ground. Even in a perfect world, nothing can ever entirely eliminate spam. Everyone has a Grandma selling Avon that doesn’t care how much people might dislike her relentless self-promotion on Facebook, or a cousin who is stuck in a pyramid scheme and blissfully unaware of his predicament. But more steps need to be taken by Google to decrease its presence. Unfortunately, that's much easier for us to say than it is for Google to do. What can be done? As GitHub previously needed a wake-up call for how to better treat things on a social level, Google might also need to reexamine a few things about how it wants to handle Google+ going forward. Just because the platform has become niche doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a future. For fans of Google’s services, developers on its platforms, and news outlets such as ourselves, the service has genuine utility left in it. To that end, Google has responded to the recent criticisms leveled at the service by promising to do things better going forward. And knowing Google, it will find a novel solution to the problem. But can the it be fixed by itself? Across two responses to the recent posts complaining about spam, Google+ engineer manager Leo Deegan stated that it was the number 1 issue to be addressed going forward. He also acknowledged that some of the interface changes in the redesign on Desktop made things more difficult, but changes are planned for the future. Some of their areas of focus going forward will include better spam control, enhanced community moderation, cleaner notifications, and better navigation. It might seem from the outside that change is occurring slowly, but a lot of work has been done updating things behind the scenes. He reaffirmed that Google is committed to the future of G+, as demonstrated by its inclusion as a core G Suite product, and was glad that the community was providing feedback about these concerns. Spam might just be an indicator that a platform is popular enough to be a target, but a number of the tools that could potentially be used to fight it aren't possible as a result of the other problems I mentioned. By ostracizing Google+, all Google does is ensure that the spam stays in a closed box. If more of Google's services made use of the platform, more eyes would be on its content, and more would likely be reported. With more eyes in Google+ the volume of spam might not change, but spam itself would be reported faster and more frequently. And by not using the service — either as individuals or professionally — Google further decreases the number of eyes on content. In reddit parlance: admins are asleep, post spam. But, imagine they never woke up. It's like an abandoned house covered with graffiti. If the landlord doesn't check in, and a lack of business keeps visitors from the area, all the people living in the neighborhood still have to put up with it. Unfortunately for Google, the cost for us to leave is 0. But fortunately for the neighbors, Google has promised to renovate soon. Tags Google Google Plus opinion spam subscribe ...

It was actually quite active for a while, and I hit about 80,000 followers. I followed hundreds of interesting people. Had thousands of great discussions. Then the spam started. We all complained to Google, but it was like talking to ourselves. After a while, I was spending most of my time on the service blocking spam, while all the people I followed gave up and left. I left about 6 months ago, as my feed slowly came to a halt due to the exodus. This is much the same sequence as all the social media sites that have come before. Great for a while, turns to crap, I move on. It was great while it lasted. If you're still finding G+ useful, more power to you. chromaniac The problem started when Google decided that they know what Google+ should be instead of what the users of the platform wanted it to be. I was part of the Google+ Help community and it was painful to see TCs and RSs repeating the same thing again and again every time a feature was killed or detached from the platform. In the last couple of months, there were one or two individual accounts that were posting updates. Most of which were teeny tiny enhancements or bug fixes that no one cared about. It's insane how badly they killed a solid platform with a small but dedicated user base. Of course, for a company the size of Google, a product needs to have a sizable user base which Google+ never attained. Too bad, instead of killing it like Google Reader, they keep on dragging it on and on and on insulting the remaining users/fans. bekifft And don't forget that they killed Google Reader specifically because it was seen as a threat to the growth of Google+. I'm still mad at them for that. bekifft There's no metaphor for Google+ as a baby, Google+ was more of a clone born out of a desperate fear of Facebook, combined with poor management. It was always a solution in search of a problem that only Google had and no one else saw as a problem. The start of Google+ and the reign of Larry Page perfectly coincide with the start of Google losing focus. It's been all downhill from there, from a user focus perspective. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Well stated. Cliff Wade Huge thanks to Ryne Hager for the mention and linking to my post. :) Ryne Hager Woo! Thanks for being cool with me doing it. First (real) op-ed. Cliff Wade @ryne_hager:disqus Any time man. Excellent article, but then again, it's written on AP, so you know it's going to be good! :) In all seriousness, really good article and a lot of good stuff was mentioned and discussed. I am a member of the G+ Early Access community, Google+ Create and Community Vanguards(got invited into the last two because of my post you linked to) and I can say there are quite a few things being worked on. One of which deals with spam but I can't elaborate unfortunately. It's just one small step towards what will be coming in the near future hopefully. Leo Deegan, Carter Gibson, LeAnne Osborne and others are very active on G+ and it's good to see things being discussed, both openly and in private communities about the future and updates to G+. I really feel there are some changes coming soon. Ryne Hager Good to hear! I am confident Google will be able to sort things out for the platform. yanick So many astrologers and this article is only opinion. Why didn't you asked them about G+ future? :-))) Ryne Hager Damn, I could have avoided writing this entirely. Next time.

Nick Coad Wooooosh abc Gee, you're an idiot. Mace Moneta Most of the people I followed on G+ starting leaving about a year ago due to the spam. I finally left about 6 months ago. Amazingly, Twitter was much better, though it obviously doesn't easily support long form content. So now, 18 months after the people I know started to leave, Google has decided to address the problem? Great. IainPurdie Gave up on G+ several months ago when they "updated" it. At that point, any posts I put up on my business page were "Me Only" and there was no way to change it. The page with the option to fix this was inaccessible. G+ became, essentially, useless. Plus, they never opened it up fully to allow third party apps to post to it as Twitter and FB have done, making it too much donkey work to use. Then there's the atrocious app that throws stuff from my feed at me in a worse, more random fashion than facebook. It's impossible to find a post you read two minutes ago. skeleton My girlfriend says she doesn't know how to work it, they need to make it more accessible to the average Joe.

Suicide_Note Oh, i totally am, but that doesn't change the fact that your girl is a dim bulb. skeleton Good one, did that make your day? Suicide_Note No, but then it wasn't supposed to.

Those spammers clearly target all android beginners and spam them with irrelevant ads. Come here and most economical public buses have exactly same such fake astrology ads all over... NeilR You can find spam anywhere in the world but at least those fake astrology ads are simple enough to be brushed off as most people as spam. NeilR Just because the author of the article linked a few screenshots of spam posts you assume most of the spam on Google+ comes from middle east and India. Nice. Any other sweeping generalizations you make? abc No.1 in spam!! 'Murica, fuck yeah! Ryne Hager You are right, the images are a bit too repetitive. Just to make it clear we didn't intend to single anyone out, I've changed a few of the images in the editorial. Vikas For me Google+ is just a tool to signup for beta or tech support of any app or product. chromaniac Google removed that requirement long time ago. Google+ Sign-in because Google Sign-in. Hamza Abass grateful permit easy access to my google+ account at any time. Vikas These Astrologer, Lost Lover and Champcash spammers can be found everywhere here in India. Carlos Eugênio Meanwhile many normal posts are being considered spam without the option or possibility to approve them in our communities. Schultzter I still say there's nothing new in Google+ that Google didn't already have in their existing products. Their effort would have been much better improving the products they had, keep them separate but make it easy to move from one to the other from within Google. There's no point trying to build a better Facebook now that everyone is already on Facebook. chromaniac The way Google f'ed it up after departure of Vic is astonishing. I finally deleted my account 2 weeks ago. I only miss following the posts of few folks who I believe only post on Google+. But the user experience had become so painful that it was time to say it goodbye. Unbelievable what Google did with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ It's not like you can just crack the social media market and become relevant at will, regardless of resources at your disposal. I can sort of imagine the reasons why Twitter got so popular, but don't think it would be easy to try to replicate it. YuCMi You're right, it also takes some awareness and a plan. Both of which Google never seemed to have. Stu I still use it but solely to perform the basic functions that Google Spaces did before Google stopped developing for it. aRvInD When many Googlers who write Android code still use iPhone as primary devices clearly says they themselves aren't interested much in their products... Harsh but truth..! Zsolt V Harsh but a lie. aRvInD Lie?? When why iPhone's Google apps often contain some new features before they get pushed to android beta users? Zsolt V Often? It happens very rarely and then it's because different teams work on different platforms. But what the fuck does that have anything to do with Google+? Or do you really think that the choice that person makes has any influence on the release schedule? At least at Google there is a choice. Can you imagine an Apple employee using a non-iPhone or non-Mac? Vantius Google+ in it's early days had a lot of interesting and new ideas to social media. The idea of putting people into groups based on interests and assigning audiences to posts based on those groups was a great idea. The idea of being able share live videos was a good idea too. It forced Facebook to adapt and improve it's own services. But, Google lost sight and IMHO started going downhill on the introduction of collections. it became obvious that they didn't know which way to take it. András Oláh I think Collections was a great idea but terrible implementation especially after the material design update. If it is a pain to manage your own collections and required 5+ clicks to set the collection you want to post to, no wonder no-one will use it. And the Collections landing page is even more terrible, there is zero visual indication whether a followed collection has any new content or not. I stopped following new collections because I felt that there is no point, as I will never see again those post in my stream. I stopped using more than 4 collections because of the inconvenient UI of switching collections. catalysto Sharing to collections is very easy. Sharing a photo to the G+ app, you can choose any collection or group you want right at the top. Metallinatus But.... did the black mage solve your problem? Ryne Hager 'course they did. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/495e00ef0755a130a47e98be9a9c81d1d83b992ccf87a3ab2b590f99a9c25400.gif Urmil Shroff I hope they do something about this, quickly. Peter Garlinski Maybe I'm one of the few, but Google+ works quite well and I've never encountered spam. Maybe it's because I've spent time with getting my circles setup with legitimate, decent people I want to get content from. With Facebook, I find it harder to really cut through the crap to talk to new people. Google+ makes it easier to do that. If Facebook ditched their awful feed concept, I would use it more, but right now Google+ is my go to platform. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ I'll second that never encountering much spam on Google+ part, at least compared to Facebook. I'm admin on a couple of user groups on Facebook and this week I had to ban at least 15 people for posting Malaysian child pornography videos..imagine. I mean I'd take astrology and sexy love any day over that despicable content. Timothy Vreeland I'll third it. I never see spam on G+. Where are the authors seeing it?

YuCMi No, because it's probably spam. YuCMi Google+ doesn't have any quality content in their trending page. At one point I wondered if it could emulate Reddit, but there's no -1 button or a way to block all the cringe teenager oriented communities. If only Google+ let their users decide what they want to see. Instead you have absolute garbage trending.

Just kidding😂 Lord Argyris That black magic specialist stuff seems to be the in thing for spammers these days. I've seen it several other places lately. Robin Hugli I use Google + a lot, not as social media but for all community for apps , beta apps community and all Android roms and development community or all popular tech news website etc , it's really good and quite active. But that's true,if a community for example become less active, like an app community that isn't updated often and the community become a bit dead , it become a spam place , many spam posts as the moderator isn't active. It's quite sad. What I suggested: on telegram, the owner of the chat can add administrators bots , that can detect spam or unsuitable post , automatically delete those posts , ban or warm people. That can be very useful on Google plus. Ryan Its really hard to care at this point. Google+ had some decent ideas around social but it was too late to the game so they "forced" people onto the platform by moving services that shouldn't have been there onto there. I only had G+ for photos and sharing location (when they stripped latitude from Google Maps). And both of those rolled out with LESS functionality as a part of G+ than they did prior. Right or wrong by being forced to use G+ to get them AND the stripped functionality it created a negative association with G+ for me. I was ready for G+ to die from day one and was glad when it did (died as in I can finally uninstall the app because Google isnt forcing me into it). That was the day that location sharing returned to where it should have been all along, Google Maps. Now I have to look forward to the failure of Allo/Duo so Google can return to a real all-in-one messaging platform like what Hangouts was becoming. Sadly it will probably be 3 years from now and nobody will care because they will be even farther behind than they already are. Fruity101079 I don't know if G+ is good or not, I never understand exactly how to navigate, explore, etc... Ui doesn't seem ergonomic, for me. Allen Martin G+ is actually a great platform in terms of what it offers and from a technology standpoint. It just doesn't have ubiquity, which makes it undesirable. And it's cool to make fun of the underdog. I actually use G+ as a news feed for tech news - and most tech news sites post to it regularly (even Android Police). If it ever goes away, I won't be upset but it would be cool if it realizes potential greater than what it is. derp_cookies I'm the owner of the C++ community on Google+ with just over 100,000 users. Spam is absolutely insane. Granted, they're pretty good at flagging spam, but I had to switch all posts to require moderation because it was so bad. My list of banned users is tens of thousands long. They definitely have a spam problem; maybe normal folks won't notice it, and it's more of an issue with communities? Also side note: Is it possible to read a headline somewhere about Google+ without the word "dead" in it? Kieron Quinn I'm an admin of the XDA community (unofficial, 188K members), we used to have loads of spam but it's dropped significantly recently. How many moderators do you have? derp_cookies About 4 at the moment. D.Smithee *crickets* abc Good. Can't wait for it to die. One less piece of Google bloatware on my phone. Gabby Now if we could only get the same examination of Disqus spam. Almost all of it looks so similar that their continuing failure to block it makes me suspect they are actually profiting from the spam somehow.

Several high-tech industry companies that have opposed the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement have pledged to continue their environmentally conscious efforts. Google CEO Sundar Pichai promised to stay the course in his tweeted response: Disappointed with today's decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 "Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. "For our part, we've committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy," he added. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff tweeted a statement of his company's resolve to promote sustainability. Deeply disappointed by President's decision to withdraw from ParisAgreement. We will double our efforts to fight climate change. pic.twitter.com/cmCLf9CoVY — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 "Microsoft believes that climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action," President Brad Smith posted on LinkedIn. "We've sent letters to and held meetings on this topic with senior officials in the State Department and the White House." Apple CEO Tim Cook earlier this week urged President Trump to keep the U.S. in the agreement, he told employees in an email. Climate change is real, Cook said. Although disappointed with the pullout, he pledged to continue the company's environmental push. <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14966399293720" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762539&amp;cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14966399293720" border="0" alt="" /></a> Why Trump Withdrew From the Paris Agreement Compliance with the terms of the agreement "could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025," including 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs, President Trump said, citing a study by National Economic Research Associates. By 2040, compliance would cut production for various sectors, costing close to US$3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, Trump said, based on the study's findings. Other studies, carried out not only by environmental organizations, but also by Citibank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have concluded that failure to curb climate change could cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars, according to a New York Times news analysis. The Paris Agreement "could legitimately be branded as an economic accord, given the potential financial impact on the countries that agreed to it," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. However, "given the impact on climate is both disputed and indirect, it likely would have been more accurate to call this an accord that's more directly focused on pollution, because the core measurements were tied to that," he told TechNewsWorld. The Paris Agreement "was more of a political vehicle and one that was long on promise but very short on actual content," Enderle said, adding that it lacks teeth to ensure compliance. It appears that Trump's decision this week has triggered a process that will continue into 2020, likely ensuring that climate change will be a significant issue during the next presidential election. Seeking a Brave New World The Trump administration will begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris Agreement or to create a new one "on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its people, its taxpayers," the president said. However, France, Germany and Italy said in a joint statement that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated. "Overpopulation and the environment are issues that must be addressed now," said Jim McGregor, principal at Tirias Research. "If there's something awry with the current agreements, we need to address those issues, either with modifications to the agreement or a new one -- not just walk away," he told TechNewsWorld. "The U.S. should be the leader, not the anchor holding us back by not signing the accords," McGregor added. What High-Tech Companies Can Do "Any number of companies are acting consciously to improve their environmental impact," noted Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. For example, Dell EMC "has a variety of initiatives," he told TechNewsWorld, including "using recycled materials in their packaging ... and an initiative to recycle plastics floating in the ocean." Still, many tech companies "talk the talk but don't walk the walk when it comes to the environment," Tirias' McGregor pointed out. The fact that both supporters and opponents of environmental issues "know much of what they're saying isn't true, makes positive change almost impossible to accomplish," Enderle said. The tech industry "is all about data and accuracy," he remarked, and it "could use these tools to cut through the dishonesty and help those that truly want to make change."

Kelkoo claims Google has crippled its business by illegally exploiting its monopoly over internet searches, and is seeking damages that could run to millions of pounds. It comes as the European Commission prepares to hit Google with a fine expected to run into the billions in the coming weeks. Brussels regulators have been investigating Google for seven years, and claim it has taken advantage of its 90pc share of European internet searches to unfairly promote its own price comparison service, which automatically checks across internet retailers to find online shoppers the best deal. Google has completely destroyed most of the industry. They set about systematically destroying the likes of KelkooRichard Stables, Kelkoo chief executive Searching Google for “cheap televisions” will prominently display the search engine’s own service, putting rival comparison services like Kelkoo at a disadvantage. Kelkoo’s High Court case was filed in December 2015 but is expected to come to the fore in the coming months. The Commission is expected to rule against Google and fine the company in June or July, before its summer recess. Kelkoo was once one of Europe’s highest-profile internet companies and was sold to Yahoo for €475m (£415m) in 2004. After it was bought by British private equity group Jamplant for less than €100m in 2008, Google began to promote its own price comparison service. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is investigating Google Credit: EPA Richard Stables, its chief executive, said Kelkoo’s traffic from Google had dropped by around 95pc in the last few years. “Google has completely destroyed most of the industry. They set about systematically destroying the likes of Kelkoo,” Mr Stables said. He did not comment on how much Kelkoo was seeking, but said industry-wide damages claims could run into the billions. Google did not comment. Last year the company won a High Court battle over somewhat similar claims that it had promoted its own maps over those from a rival, Streetmap, although unlike price comparison, maps were not a focus of a European Commission investigation. Kelkoo's revenues have fallen from €103m (£90m) in 2005 to €38.4m in 2015.

In an ironic twist, Google has beaten Amazon to Canada when it comes to smart assistants — the Echo still isn’t available in the country, despite being available for two years in the US. The Google Home will cost $179 in Canada, right on par with US pricing when you consider the ongoing devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Google hasn’t given a release date for the speaker yet, but Best Buy’s preorder page says the device will be available on June 26th; Google says two to three weeks. Either way, Canadians should finally be able to yell at an inanimate object like their American neighbors within a few weeks. The Google Home speaker will be available to purchase from Google, Best Buy, and other retail partners.

Alexa now supports reminders and named timers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 10:28am PDTJun 3, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares154 News It has been a little over 200 days since the Google Home was officially released, and owners are still waiting on Google to implement support for reminders. Perhaps in response to the growing competition, Amazon has been hard at work improving Alexa, and has now added reminders and named timers to the assistant. The reminders work pretty much as you would expect - asking "remind me to take out the trash Sunday night" will prompt your Alexa-powered device to notify you when the time comes. The named timers can be created with phrases like, "Set an oven timer for 10 minutes." Amazon only explicitly mentioned the Echo in the announcement, so it's possible these features are limited to Amazon's own devices for now and could require a software update for others (I don't have an Alexa device to test). It also seems to be limited to the United States at the time of writing, for some reason. Tags alexa amazon assistant named timers reminders timers subscribe ...

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Alexa, set guitar reminder for one minute" -- it just gives you an alarm. "Alexa, set reminder for one minute" - Alexa says, "What's the reminder for?" I say, "Guitar". 1 minute later, "Here's your reminder -- guitar." MrCalifornia Can't say I like having to give two inputs every single time. I only use multiple timers like 2% of the time.

According to cyber security firm Check Point, dozens of malicious apps were downloaded between 4.5 million to 18.5 million times from the Play Store. Some of the malware-affected apps have been discovered residing on the online store for several years. “Judy” is only one example of how an open and free mobile operating system (OS) can be exploited by malicious app developers. Most security flaws we hear about now affect old versions of the OS or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security, technology website extremetech.com reported. New versions secure The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $200,000. Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who can find a flaw, get a cash prize — the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000—$50,000, the report said.

It’s all about Josephine Baker, a world-famous entertainer known for her famous banana costume and activism.  » RELATED: Google honors famous African American female sculptor with doodle The search engine site, which sometimes uses its homepage to honor prominent figures, is highlighting the dancer on what would have been her 111th birthday.  Born Freda Josephine McDonald in 1906, Baker grew up in poverty in St. Louis but gravitated towards the arts at a young age. As a girl, she toured with the Jones Family Band and Dixie Steppers and later joined the musical “Shuffle Along” as a teen in New York. Her fame as a jazz musician grew after she renounced her U.S. citizenship and uprooted to Paris in the 1920s. The French vedette appeared on stages across the globe, but one of the most memorable ones featured her in a banana skirt with bedazzled jewels strewn across her neck. Baker was an actress, too. She landed roles in French films including “Princesse Tam Tam” and “Moulin Rouge.” She was the first person of African descent to become a global artist and to star in a major motion picture. Despite her fame, she did not have a warm homecoming when she returned to America in the 1950s. At least 36 hotels refused to serve her. She was so appalled by the treatment that she only performed for integrated audiences and began travelling the South, speaking and writing about the racism in the states. »RELATED: Google honors Native American activist with doodle She eventually befriended Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks and worked closely with the NAACP. When King was assassinated, his widow Coretta Scott King asked her to be the new leader of Civil Rights Movement. After some thought, she declined the offer, because she wanted to protect her children. In 1975, she died from a cerebral hemorrhage four days after starring in a comeback show to celebrate her 50 years in the business. Since her death, she has been portrayed by several singers, such as Diana Ross and Beyonce, and inducted into Hall of Fames across the United States. Now, Google is paying tribute.  "It's almost impossible to sum up such a multi-faceted figure, which is why today's Doodle is in a slideshow format highlighting several of Baker's most impactful accomplishments," doodle designer Lydia Nichols told Refinery29. "The bold, limited palette and simple aesthetic were influenced by poster art of the 1920s and 30s when Baker broke onto the scene." Check out the doodle archive to see Baker’s animated doodle. »RELATED: Who was Gilbert Baker? Google honors rainbow flag creator with doodle Related J.K.

Juventus came roaring out of the traps and bossed the first half despite going a goal behind in a massively entertaining first half. The second half could scarcely have been more different, with the Italian side comprehensively outplayed in all areas of the pitch in a niggly affair punctuated by one foul after another.

Whether he did that off his own bat or under instruction from his manager is open to debate. Having said all that, he did open the scoring tonight, but has had little impact so far.

A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month. Google has long been able to determine when users click on ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?’” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of troves of data about people.

I will use a Google Apps script called Twitter Merge to send personalized DMs in bulk. This Google Apps script allows you to use mail merge feature on Twitter right from Google Sheets. You can configure a template with variables which allow you to personalize it as per your requirements, and after that, you can send that template either as a personalized message or tweets to your followers. Read the complete tutorial to know how exactly you can do it. Sponsored Links How to use mail merge on Twitter: Basically, all you have to do is make a copy of Twitter Merge Google Sheet and then use it to send bulk direct messages and tweets. To send personalized DMs, you have to create a template. This template can contain variables and these variables should exist in the Google Sheet. These variables are then replaced by the values from its Google Sheet column which makes it personalized for every Twitter follower. So, the only major task involved in this method to write a template for your mass DM which in fact is really easy. I will explain how you can write the template in the steps below. Step 1: Make a copy of Tweet Merge from here. After that, you will see the Tweet Merge sheet as shown in the screenshot below. Before, moving forward, make sure you have added all of your Twitter followers to this sheet. You have to specify Twitter screen name of your followers in the “Twitter User” column of the Google Sheet. This can be quite a tedious task if you have a large number of following. Fortunately, there is a method to export Twitter followers to Excel. After that, you can copy and paste your Twitter followers from the downloaded Excel file to “Twitter User” column of the Google Sheets. Step 2: Now, you have to first authorize this Google Apps script to access your Twitter profile. Click on the “Twitter Merge” menu which appears right next to the Help menu at the top and select “Authorize Twitter” option. Step 3: In this step, I will explain how you can configure personalized tweets or direct messages to your Twitter followers. You have to write a template and after that, you can choose whether you want to send it as a public tweet or as a DM to your followers. Click on the Twitter Merge menu at the top and select the second option i.e. “Configure Tweets”. This will open a dialog box in which you can write the template to do mail merge on Twitter. You can simply write a message in the template and include variables in it to personalize. The variables are to be enclosed in curly braces like this “{{variable_name}}”. The only thing you have to take care is that variables in the template are in your Google Sheet. So, before writing the template you need to figure out what variables are in your DM. In my case, I wanted to send a simple DM “Hello Twitter User, check out ilovefreesoftware.com” to all of my Twitter followers. Here, “Twitter User” is the variable involved. By default, the Twitter User column was already there in the Google Sheets. So, I just specified my followers in that column. What Twitter Merge did, in the end, is that it replaced the “Twitter User” variable in the template with the username of the Twitter handles of my followers which I specified in the “Twitter User” variable. Let’s say you have a different variable then you have to create a column in the Google Sheet with the variable name and then enter the data. So, in this way, you can define variables in the template and add data in the Google Sheet to personalize it. At last, select the type of the template i.e. whether it is to be sent as a public tweet or direct message from the drop-down list below the text area, as shown in the screenshot above. To do mail merge, select “Send Direct Message” option. Step 3: After you have written a template, you can then send it as a public tweet or DM to your followers. All you have to do is select the “Send Tweets” option from the “Twitter Merge” menu. It then prompts whether you want to send the tweets or direct messages. Allow it, and you can see the progress in a small dialog box at the bottom-right of the Google Sheets. As soon as it finished sending personalized DMs to my Twitter followers, I checked it on my Twitter profile to see if it worked or not. As expected, it sent the DMs exactly in the same template, as you can see a screenshot of my Twitter DMs below.  Verdict: In this tutorial, I explained a simple method to use mail merge on Twitter. Using the method in the tutorial, you can send simple to complex personalized bulk DMs to your followers. Make a copy of Twitter Merge.

The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $2,00,000.Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who demonstrate an exploit, get a cash prize — the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000, the report said.     More Related News Nest security camera knows who’s home with Google face tech Apple WWDC 2017: Siri speaker is coming, to take on Google Home, Amazon Echo For all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App Tags: Android Google No Comments.

Homepage Sign in / Sign up Chris DixonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing www.cdixon.org/about Jun 1 Crypto Tokens: A Breakthrough in Open Network Design It is a wonderful accident of history that the internet and web were created as open platforms that anyone — users, developers, organizations — could access equally. Among other things, this allowed independent developers to build products that quickly gained widespread adoption. Google started in a Menlo Park garage and Facebook started in a Harvard dorm room. They competed on a level playing field because they were built on decentralized networks governed by open protocols. Today, tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple are stronger than ever, whether measured by market cap, share of top mobile apps, or pretty much any other common measure. Big 4 tech companies dominate smartphone apps (source); while their market caps continue to rise (source) These companies also control massive proprietary developer platforms. The dominant operating systems — iOS and Android — charge 30% payment fees and exert heavy influence over app distribution. The dominant social networks tightly restrict access, hindering the ability of third-party developers to scale. Startups and independent developers are increasingly competing from a disadvantaged position. A potential way to reverse this trend are crypto tokens — a new way to design open networks that arose from the cryptocurrency movement that began with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 and accelerated with the introduction of Ethereum in 2014. Tokens are a breakthrough in open network design that enable: 1) the creation of open, decentralized networks that combine the best architectural properties of open and proprietary networks, and 2) new ways to incentivize open network participants, including users, developers, investors, and service providers. By enabling the development of new open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation. Crypto tokens: unbundling Bitcoin Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto’s landmark paper that proposed a novel, decentralized payment system built on an underlying technology now known as a blockchain. Most fans of Bitcoin (including me) mistakenly thought Bitcoin was solely a breakthrough in financial technology. (It was easy to make this mistake: Nakamoto himself called it a “p2p payment system.”) 2009: Satoshi Nakamoto’s forum post announcing Bitcoin In retrospect, Bitcoin was really two innovations: 1) a store of value for people who wanted an alternative to the existing financial system, and 2) a new way to develop open networks. Tokens unbundle the latter innovation from the former, providing a general method for designing and growing open networks. Networks — computing networks, developer platforms, marketplaces, social networks, etc — have always been a powerful part of the promise of the internet. Tens of thousands of networks have been incubated by developers and entrepreneurs, yet only a very small percentage of those have survived, and most of those were owned and controlled by private companies. The current state of the art of network development is very crude. It often involves raising money (venture capital is a common source of funding) and then spending it on paid marketing and other channels to overcome the “bootstrap problem” — the problem that networks tend to only become useful when they reach a critical mass of users. In the rare cases where networks succeed, the financial returns tend to accrue to the relatively small number of people who own equity in the network. Tokens offer a better way. Ethereum, introduced in 2014 and launched in 2015, was the first major non-Bitcoin token network. The lead developer, Vitalik Buterin, had previously tried to create smart contract languages on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Eventually he realized that (by design, mostly) Bitcoin was too limited, so a new approach was needed. 2014: Vitalik Buterin’s forum post announcing Ethereum Ethereum is a network that allows developers to run “smart contracts” — snippets of code submitted by developers that are executed by a distributed network of computers. Ethereum has a corresponding token called Ether that can be purchased, either to hold for financial purposes or to use by purchasing computing power (known as “gas”) on the network. Tokens are also given out to “miners” which are the computers on the decentralized network that execute smart contract code (you can think of miners as playing the role of cloud hosting services like AWS). Third-party developers can write their own applications that live on the network, and can charge Ether to generate revenue. Ethereum is inspiring a new wave of token networks. (It also provided a simple way for new token networks to launch on top of the Ethereum network, using a standard known as ERC20). Developers are building token networks for a wide range of use cases, including distributed computing platforms, prediction and financial markets, incentivized content creation networks, and attention and advertising networks. Many more networks will be invented and launched in the coming months and years. Below I walk through the two main benefits of the token model, the first architectural and the second involving incentives. Tokens enable the management and financing of open services Proponents of open systems never had an effective way to manage and fund operating services, leading to a significant architectural disadvantage compared to their proprietary counterparts. This was particularly evident during the last internet mega-battle between open and closed networks: the social wars of the late 2000s. As Alexis Madrigal recently wrote, back in 2007 it looked like open networks would dominate going forward: In 2007, the web people were triumphant. Sure, the dot-com boom had busted, but empires were being built out of the remnant swivel chairs and fiber optic cables and unemployed developers. Web 2.0 was not just a temporal description, but an ethos. The web would be open. A myriad of services would be built, communicating through APIs, to provide the overall internet experience. But with the launch of the iPhone and the rise of smartphones, proprietary networks quickly won out: As that world-historical explosion began, a platform war came with it. The Open Web lost out quickly and decisively. By 2013, Americans spent about as much of their time on their phones looking at Facebook as they did the whole rest of the open web. Why did open social protocols get so decisively defeated by proprietary social networks? The rise of smartphones was only part of the story. Some open protocols — like email and the web — survived the transition to the mobile era. Open protocols relating to social networks were high quality and abundant (e.g. RSS, FOAF, XFN, OpenID). What the open side lacked was a mechanism for encapsulating software, databases, and protocols together into easy-to-use services. For example, in 2007, Wired magazine ran an article in which they tried to create their own social network using open tools: For the last couple of weeks, Wired News tried to roll its own Facebook using free web tools and widgets. We came close, but we ultimately failed. We were able to recreate maybe 90 percent of Facebook’s functionality, but not the most important part — a way to link people and declare the nature of the relationship. Some developers proposed solving this problem by creating a database of social graphs run by a non-profit organization: Establish a non-profit and open source software (with copyrights held by the non-profit) which collects, merges, and redistributes the graphs from all other social network sites into one global aggregated graph. This is then made available to other sites (or users) via both public APIs (for small/casual users) and downloadable data dumps, with an update stream / APIs, to get iterative updates to the graph (for larger users). These open schemes required widespread coordination among standards bodies, server operators, app developers, and sponsoring organizations to mimic the functionality that proprietary services could provide all by themselves. As a result, proprietary services were able to create better user experiences and iterate much faster. This led to faster growth, which in turn led to greater investment and revenue, which then fed back into product development and further growth. Thus began a flywheel that drove the meteoric rise of proprietary social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Had the token model for network development existed back in 2007, the playing field would have been much more level. First, tokens provide a way not only to define a protocol, but to fund the operating expenses required to host it as a service. Bitcoin and Ethereum have tens of thousands of servers around the world (“miners”) that run their networks. They cover the hosting costs with built-in mechanisms that automatically distribute token rewards to computers on the network (“mining rewards”). There are over 20,000 Ethereum nodes around the world (source) Second, tokens provide a model for creating shared computing resources (including databases, compute, and file storage) while keeping the control of those resources decentralized (and without requiring an organization to maintain them). This is the blockchain technology that has been talked about so much. Blockchains would have allowed shared social graphs to be stored on a decentralized network. It would have been easy for the Wired author to create an open social network using the tools available today. Tokens align incentives among network participants Some of the fiercest battles in tech are between complements. There were, for example, hundreds of startups that tried to build businesses on the APIs of social networks only to have the terms change later on, forcing them to pivot or shut down. Microsoft’s battles with complements like Netscape and Intuit are legendary. Battles within ecosystems are so common and drain so much energy that business books are full of frameworks for how one company can squeeze profits from adjacent businesses (e.g. Porter’s five forces model). Token networks remove this friction by aligning network participants to work together toward a common goal— the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new token networks like Ethereum have grown along side it. Moreover, well-designed token networks include an efficient mechanism to incentivize network participants to overcome the bootstrap problem that bedevils traditional network development. For example, Steemit is a decentralized Reddit-like token network that makes payments to users who post and upvote articles. When Steemit launched last year, the community was pleasantly surprised when they made their first significant payout to users. Tokens help overcome the bootstrap problem by adding financial utility when application utility is low This in turn led to the appreciation of Steemit tokens, which increased future payouts, leading to a virtuous cycle where more users led to more investment, and vice versa. Steemit is still a beta project and has since had mixed results, but was an interesting experiment in how to generalize the mutually reinforcing interaction between users and investors that Bitcoin and Ethereum first demonstrated. A lot of attention has been paid to token pre-sales (so-called “ICOs”), but they are just one of multiple ways in which the token model innovates on network incentives. A well-designed token network carefully manages the distribution of tokens across all five groups of network participants (users, core developers, third-party developers, investors, service providers) to maximize the growth of the network. One way to think about the token model is to imagine if the internet and web hadn’t been funded by governments and universities, but instead by a company that raised money by selling off domain names. People could buy domain names either to use them or as an investment (collectively, domain names are worth tens of billions of dollars today). Similarly, domain names could have been given out as rewards to service providers who agreed to run hosting services, and to third-party developers who supported the network. This would have provided an alternative way to finance and accelerate the development of the internet while also aligning the incentives of the various network participants. The open network movement The cryptocurrency movement is the spiritual heir to previous open computing movements, including the open source software movement led most visibly by Linux, and the open information movement led most visibly by Wikipedia. 1991: Linus Torvalds’ forum post announcing Linux; 2001: the first Wikipedia page Both of these movements were once niche and controversial. Today Linux is the dominant worldwide operating system, and Wikipedia is the most popular informational website in the world. Crypto tokens are currently niche and controversial. If present trends continue, they will soon be seen as a breakthrough in the design and development of open networks, combining the societal benefits of open protocols with the financial and architectural benefits of proprietary networks. They are also an extremely promising development for those hoping to keep the internet accessible to entrepreneurs, developers, and other independent creators.

Google search data show which states search the most for information on student aid. by Robert Kelchen June 2, 2017 2:13 PM Higher Education Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email In advance of this week’s National Spelling Bee finals, Google released data on the word that people located in each state searched “how to spell” on a regular basis. (Kudos to South Dakota for being so interested in how to spell “college!”) I used the Google Trends tool to search for how often people in each state searched for information on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) over the last five years and one year, as well as how often they searched for the “FASFA”—a pronunciation that is like fingernails on the chalkboard for many folks in higher education. Between 2012 and 2016, interest in both the FAFSA (in blue) and the FASFA (in red) followed a pretty typical pattern, as shown in the first graph below. Searches picked up in frequency on January 1 (the first day to file for the new application year) before peaking around March 1 (when many state aid deadlines occur) and falling off dramatically in September. But in the 2016-17 application cycle (the second graph), searches spiked near October 1 (the new first date for filing the FAFSA) with a smaller peak around January 1 and an equal peak around March 1. This shows how the early FAFSA changes did reach students and their families. Note: The “FAFSA” is in blue and the “FASFA” is in red. I also looked at search intensity by state over the last year, with the most intense state receiving a value of 100. Mississippi had the highest intensity of FAFSA searches, while Oregon’s value of 42 was less than half of Mississippi’s value. Louisiana and Arkansas tied for the highest FASFA value (30), while Minnesota (7) had the lowest value. Looking at FAFSA-to-FASFA search ratios (a proxy for how commonly people searched for the wrong term), Louisiana had the lowest ratio of 3.07—indicating the highest frequency of incorrect searches. Meanwhile, Minnesotans were the least likely to type “FASFA” relative to “FAFSA,” with a ratio of 10. FAFSA and FASFA search intensity, May 31, 2016 to May 31, 2017.

From the Salon Archives: Google Street View's debut prompts warnings about privacy and the future of surveillance Farhad Manjoo Skip to Comments Topics: Google, Google Street View, partner video, Salon Archives, technology, Innovation News This story Salon story was originally published as "Google is watching you (but so is everyone else)" on June 1, 2007. Let’s say that one bright afternoon a few weeks ago you decided, as one does, “Hey, let me pop into the adult bookstore.” There’s one right down the street from you, after all, 367 12th Street in downtown Oakland, a humble little place that goes by the unprepossessing name Adult Book Store. You didn’t want to make a show of it, obviously; you kind of ambled inside, hands behind your back, looking but not looking, your gait suggesting confidence and sophistication. And you would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for those nosy geeks down in Mountain View: Of all the sin joints in all the towns in all world, you had to walk into the one that, at that very second, was being trailed by a VW Beetle pimped out with an 11-lens digital camera that was taking in everything it saw, and posting it all to Google’s servers. Now there you are on Google Maps, memorialized in your moment of weakness, and the whole Web — even Matt Drudge! — is laughing at your accursed luck. Such is life in a time of Google Street View. Earlier this week, Google Maps debuted a system that offers 360-degree snapshots of thousands of addresses in five cities across the country (San Francisco, New York, Denver, Las Vegas and Miami). The service might come in handy next time you wonder if a certain new restaurant in an out-of-the-way part of town is a hole in a wall, but so far Street View seems to have raised more alarm than acclaim. Google acquired the pictures by contracting with a firm called Immersive Media, which drove camera-equipped cars all around town, capturing not only streets but also everything that happens on and around streets — people walking (and jaywalking), people loitering, people shopping, people picking their noses, people jogging, people driving cars, and even people hanging around porn stores and strip clubs. Now the Web’s atwitter with recriminations. A woman writing in to Boing Boing reported feeling “the shakes” when she discovered that Google’s camera saw right into her apartment. Wired’s Threat Level blog is compiling a brimming album of pictures of folks caught in not-for-the-whole-world-to-see situations, including one of a man who looks like he’s breaking into an apartment building, and another of women sunbathing at Stanford. No one is more exercised than Drudge, who led with the Google story for much of Thursday, linking to several unfortunate Street Views under a banner headline — SMILE, YOU’RE ON GOOGLE EARTH! — that nicely distills the overarching fear the project generates: “Could Google have caught me doing something I wouldn’t want plastered on the Web?” Indeed, Google very well might have, and privacy advocates aren’t happy. On Wednesday, Kevin Bankston, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET that it’s “irresponsible for Google to debut a product like this without also debuting technological measures that would obscure the identities of people photographed by this product.” Google, in response, pointed out that its cameras had only caught what was in clear view; its images were “no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street,” a spokeswoman told CNET. This sounds like a reasonable position. I live just around the corner from San Francisco’s historic Painted Ladies, and every time I walk out of my house my image is likely getting sucked into someone’s SD Card and uploaded, without my knowledge, to Flickr. It would be unreasonable for me to get upset when this happens; I shouldn’t expect my actions to be private, after all, when I’m in a public place where people have a First Amendment right to document what’s going on. If you think about it, is Google acting any differently from trigger-happy Japanese businessmen on a first trip to Manhattan? When I talked to Bankston about the plan on Thursday, he acknowledged that Google’s project highlights the tension between free speech and the right to privacy — a balance that has never been cut-and-dried, but that is growing increasingly uneasy now that “comprehensive surveillance is no longer something out of science fiction.” Bankston doesn’t believe Google’s effort violates the law. “I think they have a First amendment right to document the public spaces we share,” he says. Rather, Bankston thinks the project is unethical. Unlike people who post pictures of street scenes to Flickr, Google’s plan operates on an enormous scale, and it’s completely automated, meaning that it exercises no human judgment over what should and shouldn’t be put online. When Google indexes the Web, it follows every Web site’s Robot Exclusion Protocol, a machine-readable file that webmasters draw up to tell search engines what should and shouldn’t be included in search. There is no Robot Exclusion Protocol for the real world. Google allows people to report pictures that should be taken down from Street View, but by the time you learn that there’s a shot of you going into an A.A. meeting, an abortion clinic or attending a political protest — well, by then the damage may already have been done. Bankston admits that it would probably have been quite difficult, if not impossible, for Google to have blurred out the people it captured in its street pictures. But he notes that if anyone has the collective brainpower to do that, it’s them. Yet even if Google does someday implement a way to cut people out of its street scenes, Street View is simply another reminder of what we’re inevitably going to lose in a time of easy recording and distribution of images and other documents: anonymity. Nothing you do is hidden anymore, and while we can argue about whether or not this is a salutary thing — Bankston argues persuasively that anonymity serves an essential social function; (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous) — keeping things secret, now, might just be impossible. Let’s come back again to that shot of you walking into the adult bookstore. Panning around the scene, we see a woman window-shopping nearby, and across the street a bus is unloading its passengers. There are several cars, too, moving down the street. If you’re ever contemplating visiting such an establishment again, it might be wise to operate on the assumption that all these people are packing cameras. Already, weirdos like Justin.tv are stalking our streets, broadcasting all they encounter; is it really fantastical to think that in five or 10 years’ time, everyone might be recording everything? Likely not. Watch out. Farhad Manjoo is a Salon staff writer and the author of True Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society. More Farhad Manjoo.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Even If the Siri Speaker Sucks You'll Want It Adam Clark EstesSaturday 11:00am Filed to: apple siri steve jobs amazon echo google home alexa google assistant 264 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Getty / Gizmodo We all know Apple’s game by now. Wait in the wings while all of the other companies fuck up while trying to innovate, and then, just when it seems almost too late, introduce a product that does the same thing as everybody else’s product, but better. This is bound to be true with the rumored Siri speaker. The idea is oddly exciting. It’s widely believed that, on Monday, Apple will reveal this so-called Siri speaker. The voice-controlled device is supposed to be a lot like the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, except, you know, it’s an Apple product. That means it will look great, work great, and cost a great sum of money. According to rumors, that also means that the gadget will lack some of the flashy features of seen in the current contenders on the market. The Siri speaker probably won’t have a touchscreen, like the new Amazon Echo Show. It probably won’t have a built-in wi-fi router, like the rumored Google Home hardware update. Your Move, Apple It feels like it’s 2001. Tons of companies had released tons of MP3 players, and they all sucked.…Read more That’s kind of the point, though. Apple is famous for releasing first generation products that do just enough, really well. Just think about the original iPod, which celebrates its sweet 16 this year. The market was flooded with problematic MP3 players by the time Steve Jobs announced Apple’s magical solution in October 2001. Jobs himself explained how companies small and large were trying and failing to build music players. Advertisement “They haven’t found the recipe,” Jobs said at that event, moments before revealing the iPod. “No one has really found the recipe yet for digital music.” Now get ready for the good shit. “And we think,” Jobs continued, “not only can we find the recipe, but we think the Apple brand is going to be fantastic, because people trust the Apple brand to get their great digital electronics from.” You can just imagine those exact same words coming out of Tim Cook’s mouth on Monday to describe Apple’s entry into the smart speaker market. Lots of companies, large and small, have tried to sell an internet-connected, voice-controlled speaker for the home. None of them are awesome. Amazon’s had the most success with Echo, largely because it was the first mega tech company to introduce a viable option. Echo gained steam as a smart home hub, too, because Amazon let virtually any company develop the capability to work with Alexa, Amazon’s half-decent, artificially intelligent assistant. And despite its relative dominance in the information space, Google’s smart speaker, blandly named “Home,” has struggled to take a bite out of Amazon’s market share. So here comes Apple. If the Cupertino kids do announce a new piece of hardware at the WWDC conference this year, it will almost certainly be some sort of smart speaker. People are calling it the “Siri speaker,” because such a device would use Siri’s computer brain power to respond to voice commands and questions. We can also expect an upgrade to Siri, perhaps a new version that can distinguish between different voices and maintain multiple user profiles. (Google Home already does this, and Amazon is expected to release the feature soon.) Otherwise, the Siri speaker will probably do the same things as the Home and the Echo—only, hopefully, better. After all, Apple is increasingly admitting that it’s a luxury brand. For a smart speaker, that would mean that the sound quality would far surpass the tin-can tones of an Echo. Some rumors claim that Apple actually wants to take on Sonos in offering high-quality wireless audio throughout the home with exceptional acoustics and the processing power of an iPhone 6. Meanwhile, we have to expect Apple to flex its dominance in the privacy and security spheres. As too many people clutch their pearls over the idea of an Echo recording all of their conversations, the market is definitely primed for a safe-seeming smart speaker. It will also—Jony Ive voice—be an extraordinarily beautiful object. A design porn shot from an iPad Pro promotional video (Image: YouTube) But this all begs the question: who’s going to buy this new Apple object? It’s not immediately obvious that people need a smart speaker in the same way that they needed a smartphone when Apple released the iPhone ten years ago. Then again, nobody needed a smartwatch when the Apple Watch came out and now it’s the number one product in the category. Is it because the Apple Watch is the very best wearable computer? Who knows. Do people trust the Apple brand to build great digital electronics? A lot of them do, yes. Even more powerful than that, however, is the fact that a lot people will buy a new gadget simply because Apple made it. Call them fanboys or girls or whatever you want, but Apple loyalists are fucking loyal. Advertisement Sponsored Steve Jobs programmed them to be. From the early Mac days, the late visionary excelled at convincing people that electronics were their friends. After all, way back in 1984, the original Macintosh computer gave its own robotic but revolutionary introduction speech. “I’d like to let Macintosh speak for itself,” Job said, and the computer did. The crowd went wild. We don’t know what will happen at WWDC 2017. If Apple does announce a smart speaker, maybe Tim Cook will invite Siri will make the announcement herself (itself?). There’s a good chance the device won’t be available until the fall, a move that would echo Google’s announcing the Home last spring for a fall release. Of course, Apple might also let us all down and announce some boring new iPad update or no new hardware at all. Advertisement But if Apple does decide to join the smart speaker circus, the company will almost certainly do it as Steve Jobs would’ve wanted. The gadget will be simple. It will be beautiful. It will work. It will sort of suck, but that’s why you have to stick around to buy the second generation—and the third and the fourth until infinity.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Internet Google Chrome to block all adverts on websites that annoy users with intrusive pop-ups Google's ad blocker will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines. By Associated Press Updated June 3, 2017 18:12 BST Google's ad blocker will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelinesLeon Neal/AFP/Getty Images Websites that run annoying ads such as pop-ups may find all ads blocked by Google's Chrome browser starting next year. The digital-ad giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google's version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don't go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It'll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don't get rid of annoying types of ads. But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser's efforts. It's a "small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences," Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. "I'm sure there are some publishers who will get hurt," said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won't let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It'll take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers' concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won't place its ads on web pages with objectionable content — porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it's trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with "little substantive content" and "disruptive, shocking or malicious ads."

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 337 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares551 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. Robert Hynes I still have the shutdown issue....anywhere from 60 to 20%. Unlikely I will get a pixel or other Google device unless there is a fix. Maybe we just need a more high profile device like a Samsung in order to get noticed. Jeffrey Huston I started experiencing this for the first time on my Nexus 6p shortly after installing Android 7.1.2. It can happen anywhere from 20% to even 60%, and happens multiple times daily. I've had the phone for probably a year and am generally always on the latest Android version. I don't think it started immediately; might have started a week after installing 7.1.2. I initially blamed an app or a Google play services update, but I've been factory resetting my phone three times now, each time reinstalling and updating fewer and fewer things to see if it would stop happening. It hasn't stopped yet. My next step was going to be factory resetting and doing zero app installs and updates (then it's basically just a phone, gross), but then I stumbled on this article. Now I'll probably skip that next factory reset and see if Google will send me a new phone. Hans Breda I contacted Google Support about this issue. They were very cooperative and are sending me a replacement! Hope this will solve the problem. chesterbr I did not have the bootloop, but phone would shutdown anywhere below 30%. After reading some experiences here I got my battery replaced at a local shop (Mobile Klinik in Toronto, CAD$ 60 plus tax, service done in 1-hour, no data loss or anything), and the problem is GONE: phone goes down to 1% at a steady pace. Normal usage gives me an entire day, just like it did when I purchased it. I'll be sad if a class action lawsuit earns something (not for the money, but for the principle), but it seems it will give my phone at least another year of life (heck, possibly more, this phone is a beast). But I'll hardly ever buy Google (or Huawei) again - this is not how you handle such issues. Michael Magdy My Nexus 6p stuck on google screen.. And the shutdown and repeat again.. Noone could solve this till now.. Even the two companies google and huwaei don't respond or tell where is the problem I went to a software programmer.. He could do nothing also It's now just a piece of metal I need help Kishor Padghan My Nexus 6p experienced early shut down 2 times so far despite having enough battery. It can be restarted only after battery is fully discharge and charging the phone. My phone has been unreliable now, it can ditch me any time. RJ Southam Mine started this weekend, I got a whopping 19 months out of my phone, however it still boots eventually just not sure for how much longer... Elizabeth Warner I basically keep a charger with me all the time and plug in in the car, at the office, at home... Very inconsistent, sometimes shuts down showing orange, but today was shutting down and showed as being at 28%. I've been uninstalling apps that I don't use, have a battery monitor so that I don't over charge... Dave Haines mine turns off randomly with about 30-40% left on the battery i dont think i have actually had it come up with power save in the last 2 months.... ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

Google confirms that Chrome will integrate an ad blocker in 2018 by Wayne Manion  3:30 PM on June 2, 2017 A little over a month ago, the internet started buzzing with rumors that Google would bake ad-blocking right into its Chrome browser. A new post on Google's blog, written by the company's Senior VP of Ads & Commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy, confirms that selective ad-blocking is coming to Chrome early next year. Most websites, including ours, are funded at least in part through advertising. Some sites also use more intrusive ads than others. Intrusive ads include auto-playing audio, videos with sound, countdown timers, and pop-ups—among many other variants. Google believes these intrusive ads cause users to install ad-blocking software. Therefore, the company believes that if the obnoxious ads are eliminated, users won't go to the Chrome Store for the latest across-the-board ad-blocking browser add-on. To this end, Google joined the Coalition for Better Ads, a body that also includes Facebook and Reuters, among other organizations. Ramaswamy says the company "plan(s) to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018." Put simply, all ads on pages containing any non-compliant advertising will be blocked by Chrome's built-in ad blocker. Whether this move will actually result in the desired effect is something to be seen. The post also announced Funding Choices, a new program that extends the company's earlier Contributor service. Sites that choose to participate in Funding Choices can display a personalized message to users of ad-blocking software and offer them a choice to enable ads for the site or make microtransaction-like per-page payments through the user's Google Contributor pass.

Josephine Baker Google Doodle honors Jazz Age icon & highlights her civil rights work Born on this date in 1906, Baker was one of the most photographed women of her time. Amy Gesenhues on June 3, 2017 at 7:55 am More Google traded out its homepage logo today to celebrate Jazz Age icon performer, civil rights activist and French spy Josephine Baker. Born on this date 111 years ago, Baker reached international fame by the 1920s. A star of the stage, her singing and dancing won her a role as part of the chorus line in “Shuffle Along,” the first all-black Broadway musical. After moving to Europe, Baker’s celebrity status skyrocketed. “She set off for Paris and found her fame and artistic home in the city’s opulent cabarets, singing and performing uninhibited dance routines that celebrated female liberation and African cultural identity,” reports the Google doodle team. Baker was one of the most photographed women on the planet during her lifetime. She was also a committed fighter for civil rights, refusing to perform for segregated audiences and working to advance the NAACP efforts. Google also notes Baker’s time with the French Resistance during World War II when she worked on the sly, “hobknobbing” with Axis officials at high-profile events to collect intelligence during the war, “…often writing it on her sheet music in invisible ink.” After the war Charles de Gaulle awarded Baker the Croix de Guerre and inducted her into France’s Legion of Honour. Google’s doodle honoring the performer leads to a search for “Josephine Baker” and is designed as a slide show, featuring a variety of images highlighting different stages of her life: Google is sharing the doodle on its U.S. homepage, along with a number of its international homepages, including France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Canada.

We are celebrating the St. Louis-born Creole Goddess with this tribute. Baker, who’s illustrated in today’s Google Doodle. Google says, “With her kohl-rimmed eyes and exotic costumes, Josephine Baker pounced onto the global stage in the 1920s, becoming a Jazz Age icon and one of the first internationally recognized African-American entertainers. A celebrity in Europe — and one of the most photographed women on the planet — Baker nonetheless faced racially charged comments from the press when she returned to the U.S. in 1936 for a short-lived starring turn in the Broadway series Ziegfeld Follies. Championing diversity and fighting for civil rights would become an enduring concern throughout her life. …There’s little doubt why Ernest Hemingway once called her “the most sensational woman anybody ever saw — or ever will.” Here’s why Baker was a boss in her heyday: She fought for diversity and inclusion: An avid activist, when she visited the US, she demanded to stay at the best hotels and play to integrated audiences. She possessed keen a business ability: The Roaring 1920’s star 12 adopted children (10 boys and two girls), the “rainbow tribe,” who were natives of various countries including Japan, Belgium, Algeria, Argentina, Colombia, Finland, France, Israel (though questionable), Morocco, Ivory Coast and Venezuela. The multiracial, multinational family were an attraction based on their unique reality. All dressed in white, Baker charged admission to tourists who came to hear them sing, to tour their home, or to watch them play leapfrog in their garden. They appeared in print advertisements and were interviewed by the press. She would have broken the internet first if she did it for the ‘Gram: In 1926, the biracial beauty was a sex symbol and when she performed her danse sauvage, bent over in her infamous banana skirt, practically nude, during a revue at the Folies-Bergère in Paris, the audience went wild. She owned real estate in the South of France: Baker bought a Renaissance castle in Périgord, the Château des Milandes, with more than 30 rooms, on 1,000 acres, which boasted a motel, a bakery, cafés, a jazz club, a miniature golf course, and a wax museum. A restaurant is named in her honor in New York on Broadway (Times Square): Ideally located on West 42nd Street along Theatre Row, Chez Josephine is a magnet for dining before or after the theater. They serve French cuisine. It was started by her “13th child,” Jean-Claude Baker. Her name and legend live on: Baker is the subject of many books including Josephine Baker and the Rainbow Tribe by Matthew Pratt Guterl and a biography by Jean-Claude Baker titled, Josephine: The Hungry Heart.

Happy 10th birthday, Google Street View! Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/31 7:54am PDTMay 31, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 32 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares83 Google News Videos It's hard to believe, but Google's Street View is officially 10 years old. What started out as a goofy little side project (like many of Google's most interesting products) has now managed to image numerous countries in every continent on the planet. The Google Maps add-on has even managed to gain a new lease of life with respect to virtual reality, and has proven popular as an educational tool taking learners all around the world on tours to places they might never get to see with their own eyes. Google co-founder Larry Page had the initial idea to create a 360-degree image map of the entire world. This would be his solution to the problem of teleportation, to go anywhere in the world at any time. Street View now offers that virtual capability to anyone with a smartphone or a computer. What started out as research at Stanford was picked up Google in 2004. A group of Googlers used their 20 percent time to affix some high-tech cameras and other sensors onto a van and drive it around San Francisco capturing images. This was the first Street View car. After a couple of years, they'd perfected the technology of stitching together the footage to create a continuous image of a street or other terrain, and the car was shrunk down quite a bit too. By 2007, 10 years ago, they were ready to publish their creation, and Street View has gone from strength to strength ever since. "Ten years later, we’ve published imagery on every continent, in 83 countries, and traveled about 10 million miles with the Street View car. Talk about a roadtrip." When the goal is to image the entire planet, at some point you're going to have to go where cars can't. The team's answer to that problem was the Trekker, a wearable Street View camera that could be worn as a backpack and taken anywhere a human could go. It's been used to capture many of the wonders of the world and has even proven useful to conservation organizations seeking to better observe wildlife in its natural habitat with minimal disturbance. Since 2013 Trekker cameras have been loaned out around the globe, speeding up the rate of image capture by using the local expertise of many volunteers. Just last month Google announced the next step for the project when it introduced 20 new Street View ready 360-degree cameras that will be available to the public. While this won't exactly be affordable for everyone, the intrepid (and rich) among you will now be able to buy a Street View camera of your own and go out to fill in some of the gaps that Google hasn't yet got to. I'm sure many would relish the opportunity to get involved and contribute to what has been an incredible global project. So, happy 10th birthday, Street View. Here's to the future, and wherever those stunning images will take us next. Source: The Keyword Tags 360-degree camera AR Google google maps street view video VR subscribe ...

What they actually mean is this: In fact, the fly ash emitted by a power plant—a by-product from burning coal for electricity—carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy. Note that they aren’t comparing anything to “nuclear waste” here. Not to underplay the fact that fly ash contains radioactive elements, here is the key info: McBride and his co-authors estimated that individuals living near coal-fired installations are exposed to a maximum of 1.9 millirems of fly ash radiation yearly. To put these numbers in perspective, the average person encounters 360 millirems of annual “background radiation” from natural and man-made sources, including substances in Earth’s crust, cosmic rays, residue from nuclear tests and smoke detectors. IOW, you get an extra 1/2% radiation dose from the fly ash, which is more than the extra dose what you get from a superbly-run nuclear power plant that emits virtually nothing, or having a bad banana habit. But no mention of all the unintended emissions that do occur, the leaks, the waste itself that hasn’t been dealt with, emissions from uranium mining, fuel rod processing, not to mention the occasional melt down. With nuclear it’s always what happens when things go wrong that you need to worry about. This is propaganda from the nuclear industry, pure and simple. SciAm is beyond a joke. Reply ↓ MoiAussie June 2, 2017 at 7:47 am And, the article is 10 years old. Reply ↓ Roger Smith June 2, 2017 at 7:52 am This headline immediately turned me away, Thank you for the details. Reply ↓ vlade June 2, 2017 at 8:00 am Well, the problem (having lived both near a nuclear reactor and a polluting coal station) is that the coal station pollutes day in, day out, and no-one pays attention. When something like Fukushima/Chernobyl happens, people in the vicinity know they are screwed bad time pretty much immediately. I’m willing to bet that coal and diesel emissions killed, in the same time, much more people than Fukushima/Chernobyl and both atomic bombs combined. IIRC, that (combined nuclear deaths) add up to about 300, call it 400k. The UK estimates that particulate polution (of which diesel is main cultprit, but coal until it was banned for domestic pusposes, and filters forced on commercial ones was too) kills about 28-29k people/year in the UK alone. Reply ↓ Skip Intro June 2, 2017 at 2:23 pm Ok course the nuclear waste from these plants will keep killing for over 100,000 years. Reply ↓ UserFriendly June 3, 2017 at 1:44 am How many have died so far? It’s a bad headline but it’s very true that you are safer living next to a nuclear reactor than a coal plant. Reply ↓ Mac na Michomhairle June 3, 2017 at 8:43 am I don’t know about coal burning plants, but the population in my county living in a rural area near a nuclear plant has remarkably elevated levels of cancers among children and teens. Can it be proved that the cause is the ongoing release over thirty years of radioactivity? Of course not, so we are healthier living next to a nuclear plant than a coal burning plant. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive June 2, 2017 at 8:28 am +100 Scientific American should be embarrassed! Obviously, sensationalism is more important to them than science these days….. The last disclaimer says it all: “As a general clarification, ounce for ounce, coal ash released from a power plant delivers more radiation than nuclear waste shielded via water or dry cask storage.” Reply ↓ Roger Smith June 2, 2017 at 8:33 am Science has become a brand. No one even expects actual understanding of knowledge anymore. They just snidely retort, “what, you don’t believe in science??” or “It’s science man”. That is right, it is so obvious I should just nod my head in agreement. Reply ↓ Brian June 2, 2017 at 10:26 am It has been advertised as a brand for some time now, and melded with politics to form a stream of misinformation by manipulators. But not to scientists. When you use the scientific method to solve a problem, opinion is not involved after you have selected your experiment. The manipulation happens after you reach a conclusion, which is immediately attacked for its political ramifications. Just think religion and science, flat earth, etc. Science is plagued by non scientists. Reply ↓ Greg Taylor June 2, 2017 at 12:00 pm Selection of metrics and experimental design trade-offs involve subjectivity and opinion. This allows experiments to be manipulated for a variety of purposes before any data is collected. Too often, scientists are intellectually captured by those funding their experiments and design in ways that ensure the results will please their paymasters. Reply ↓ Roger Smith June 2, 2017 at 4:44 pm Great point as well. I do not have a real grasp of research, but in an oligarchical society, it seems that it is large projects with agendas that would get the funding. Reply ↓ Roger Smith June 2, 2017 at 4:42 pm I completely agree, though I would add that it is being plagued by pop culture scientists like Tyson too.

I like how in the note they say they compare fly ash with nuclear waste sealed by a barrier or water and say that nuclear is safer. Scientific method fail. One thing they neglected to consider that should be sending off alarm bells is that people can breathe in fly ash. They accounted for exposure to crops around coal plants and the resulting radiation intake from eating those crops, but not a word about radiation in your lungs. Neither method is safe without proper engineering that cuts into profits.

Part of this involved checking a couple of very long and complex conversations (threads) on a forum called physics forum. Primarily from those readings, but also from reading any and all articles online related to Fukushima, I became very aware of how much mis- and disinformation regarding the dangers of radioactivity is being disseminated. The “coal is more radioactive than uranium/plutonium” argument is very common, probably beating out the “bananas are radioactive” one. Both are, as has just been pointed out, specious. The crucial difference between internal and external exposure is consistently ignored or misrepresented. In the forum threads, the engineers and “science guys” for lack of a better term were just as consistent in disregarding both the non-quantifiable and the non-scientists they were usually in disagreement with (except of course the non-scientists with no scientific sense at all, i.e. the “go live in a cave then” types). One (user name “nuceng” so I’m going to assume from this cohort) was continually disparaging other people posting comments, when I pointed this out I was banned permanently. I’d seen enough by that time, concluding that honest debate with the true believers was impossible. The term is apt because the temper as much as the content of the pro/anti nuke debate has revealed to me that nuclear power has a quasi-religious status in many quarters of the science/tech community, no doubt related to the more widespread worship in “developed countries” of the latest shibboleth, Progress With a Capital(ist) P. Nuke power is at the crux of this belief–it’s a quintessentially capitalist enterprise, and it offers the addictive opium of perceived command and control over both hi-tech wizardry and the most dangerous materials on earth. The import of the fact that those materials have been underground for 100s of millions or billions of years (where a greater wisdom seems to believe they should remain) seems to escape their understanding. Reply ↓ davidgmills June 3, 2017 at 1:33 am People are clueless about radioactivity. You included. Truth is we are probably going to need nuclear power at some point. But I don’t bother engaging on political or financial blogs because it is a religion for people who know absolutely nothing about radioactivity. If you think radioactivity is going to kill us all, then don’t ever consider going to the hospital to have an Xray or CT scan, much less radiation treatment. The people I trust on the issues of radioactivity and health? Radiology oncologists. Get the scoop from them. Reply ↓ JoeK June 3, 2017 at 3:07 am @davidgmills I myself generally only “engage” with thoughtful, logically coherent comments in reference to something I’ve posted, but it’s hard not to respond to yours as it’s such a wholesale misrepresentation of my post, complete with straw-man exaggerations and self-contradiction (beginning with your “engaging” despite not bothering to do so). The only possible way you could draw the conclusion I’m “clueless” about radioactivity from my short set of comments is to have misread them completely, or to have made excessive inferences based on your personal prejudices; though I could do so, I’ve no inclination to elaborate beyond pointing at the coal or banana comments as possible sources for this attempt at insight or analysis on your part. The second paragraph: are X-rays harmless after all, I missed the news, and x-ray foot measuring for shoes is about to make a comeback? Seriously, didn’t you read the part in my comment about “go back to your cave” comments? Exactly what you’re doing here, sounding like a no-sense-of-science guy. Last, having dealt with more than one cancer patient getting radiation treatment, I’ve seen “the scoop” up close and personal, thank you very much. An oncologist’s opinion on radiation, aside from being that yes it kills cells, is going to depend much more on his attitudes and beliefs than hard science. I expect that too will confound you.

Interesting how my comments get twisted into something I didn’t say, and I think it’s quite clear I didn’t. The tuo quoque argument–if you don’t think technology X is benign than go live in a cave–was referred to, but I guess I should have been more explicit. Same re uranium and other radioactive rocks being underground. It’s only one way to look at it, to be sure, one could also say that since we didn’t evolve with built-in lead shields or the equivalent, which we would have had we evolved in the presence of radioactive rocks, and since they are thus extremely hazardous, lethally so, we should–if we are compelled to make use of them, keep ourselves protected from their lethality. Using this stuff to boil water is, even from this more nuke-friendly framing, reckless. Building a nuclear reactor takes huge amounts of capital. Guess how one describes a capital-intensive process. The centralization of power, both literal and figurative, is another important factor. And the close connection to the military’s use of radioactive materials, both for power production and in weapons. Etc, etc, etc. As to the last, how many people X has killed vs. nuclear, this is one I’m well familiar with, and would consider debating, but your example is so ill-considered I fear my responding would eventually lead down a rabbit hole of misrepresentations and sloppy debate. BTDT, don’t any more. Reply ↓ UserFriendly June 3, 2017 at 7:29 am Yes, meltdowns cause lots of excess radiation. So does the sun. So do nuclear bombs. How many nuclear warheads do you think have been detonated? Just between 1945 and 1990 there were over 2000 ‘tests’. Tell me why I should worry about a comparatively miniscule amount of radiation leaking from one poorly built plant when the world was dropping hundreds of bombs each year for decades with no noticeable (unintended) effects. The problem I have with you anti nuclear people is you have no sense of scale. You are on the same level as the GOP who has been whipped into anti islamic stances by the news making everyone think there are terrorists everywhere when you are more likely to slip and die in your bathtub than get killed by a terrorist. A nuclear plant that was designed in the 70’s (so it didn’t have computers to help with the calculations) ran just fine for years until a Tsunami hit it. Some radiation spilt, yes it was unfortunate. How many people died? 0. How many countries are now going to close down nuclear plants in favor of CO2 emitting ones? WAY TOO MANY. You have no sense of scale. We don’t have any wiggle room with CO2. We are on track to turn bangladesh (with 4x the population of California) into Atlantis by the end of the century and that is the best case scenario. We only get one shot at this and you people that jump whenever the news says BOO are killing lots of innocent people. There is litteraly no way to create enough wind and PV in time because they have such a high EROI. There have been lots of improvements in the design of nuclear plants, they have been made fail safe in some tests. The biggest hurdle is the public ignorantly thinking that all nuclear is the same and it is all very likely to explode and kill them with things they can’t see. This planet and the people on it are not worth saving I am so sick of everyones selfishness, arrogance, and ignorance. Reply ↓ MoiAussie June 3, 2017 at 1:41 pm I understand exactly where you are coming from, but you lose any credibility by arguing that Yes, meltdowns cause lots of excess radiation. So does the sun. The radiation from nuclear meltdowns and the radiation from the sun are completely different in energy. Sure, heatstroke can kill, as can skin cancers, but it ain’t radiation poisoning. Sunscreen is cheap. As for Fukushima, the meltdown caused 300,000 people to be forced to evacuate to avoid deaths from radiation. And that evacuation led directly to about 1600 deaths: Fukushima evacuation has killed more than earthquake and tsunami, survey says Thousands died promptly or prematurely as a result of Chernobyl. Just because deaths due to radiation exposure are statistical rather than deterministic doesn’t diminish the danger of nuclear accidents. Even if we were to accept the risks of nuclear accidents and hope for the best, nuclear energy is not cost-competitive. Nuclear works by an accounting trick that pushes massive costs into the distant future. Only by completely ignoring the fantastic costs of cleanups, waste management, and decommissioning does nuclear make economic sense. Few plants have been decommissioned to greenfield status, and even less waste has been dealt with. Current cleanup cost estimate for Fukushima is $190B USD, double what it was 2 years ago, and it will continue to grow. That figure alone is about 6 times what it would cost to build and run a 2GW plant for 40 years. Reply ↓ UserFriendly June 3, 2017 at 4:28 pm Valid point about the evacuation deaths. As far as nuclear waste goes if there wasn’t so much public paranoia, that makes not only the permitting but the fundraising too, next to impossible we would have molten salt reactors that run on nuclear waste, are fail safe, run at atmospheric pressure, and generate electricity for a fraction of the cost. This older article spells out the hurdles rather well. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/512321/safer-nuclear-power-at-half-the-price/ And here is a more recent update. https://www.fastcompany.com/3043099/this-nuclear-reactor-eats-nuclear-waste And no I have no ties to any nuclear companie and their are several other startups with worse publicists working on the same type of reactor. I would love to get rid of every nuclear plant we have up now because they are so horribly inefficient and comparatively unsafe. But trust me, CO2 is a much, much bigger threat to the entire species than a handful of suboptimal nuclear plants even if we had 1 meltdown a year.

My assumption is that property damage only crashes are more likely in local or stop and go kinds of driving situations. The injury and fatality crashes are perhaps more representative of higher speed situations (freeways). The other assumption of course is that the increase in property damage only crashes is due to driver error (distraction).

Serious road cyclist here: Physically separated pathways might be a solution in crowded urban/suburban areas but even there I doubt that enough of them could be built to “solve” the problem. In less crowded areas – forget it, They won’t be built at all. In my experience, most localities that commit to providing better bicycling infrastructure roll out a couple of miles of protected pathways that are isolated and unconnected leaving cyclists to figure out how to navigate through the unprotected areas. Yes, human drivers kill and injure many cyclists but I’m 100% sure that they can recognize a hell of a lot more than 1% of them. Color me unimpressed with the “self-driving” car bezzle that is just another misguided tech/utopian fantasy. If you want to understand why just watch the Air Disaster series on the Smithsonian Channel and see how many accidents are caused by pilots misunderstanding/misusing the autopilot systems or being unable to manually fly the plane when the autopilot system quits or malfunctions (Air France 447 is a great example). This kind of problem is going to be much worse with the average human automobile operator in the far more crowded, less controlled and obstacle filled road environment. Reply ↓ Carolinian June 2, 2017 at 11:58 am Copenhagen has an entire network of bicycle only roads. With enough commitment that could be done here although flat as a pancake Denmark is a lot more bicycle friendly than many US cities. And there were far more air crashes in the pre automation era. Much of that was due to pilot error. These days if pilots don’t know how to use the equipment that too is pilot error. And while there have been examples of badly designed automation in Airbus planes that too is-guess what–human error. Computers were added to airliners for a reason–not as some sort of marketing gimmick. Reply ↓ roadrider June 2, 2017 at 2:33 pm With enough commitment And therein lies the problem – this isn’t Denmark and its unlikely that we’ll get that kind of commitment to bicycling infrastructure. Perhaps we would if everyone were not so hell bent on genuflecting before tech giants and their self-serving boondoggles like self-driving cars. Yes, there were more air crashes in the pre-automation era and would still be if there were no autopilots. That’s not the point. The point is that even highly skilled and trained professionals who go through a much more rigorous selection (and re-certification) process than will ever be the case for automobile drivers can still screw up when complex automated systems are involved, especially when the automated system throws up its hands and says “You take it!” because they’re so unused to the manual procedure any more. And, yes, the badly designed autopilot systems are a result of human imperfection but what are you suggesting – that the self-driving car guys are perfect and will never make mistakes or put out shoddy products or updates that bork the system? That never happens with computer hardware or software, – right? And even if experts at places like Google can get it mostly right (doubtful in any reasonable time frame) what’s going to happen when the inevitable less talented competitors enter the marketplace. I’m all for automated safety systems that override potentially bad actions by drivers but the complete self-driving car is something that I don’t think is either feasible or desirable.

The panel also rejected amendments suggested by 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben, another Sanders pick, that would have imposed a carbon tax, declared a national moratorium on fracking as well as new fossil fuel drilling leases on federal lands and waters.

If they had done that they could have had the Tories by the balls, with a veto over everything.

The US military is by far the biggest polluter on the planet, and the US spends $700 billion on armaments. Imagine the environmental impact of: * manufacturing battleships, tanks, F35s, tomahawk missiles, etc * all the fuel used by the military, especially the air force and navy * the Agent Orange, napalm, cluster bombs, depleted uranium — not exactly great for the environment * nuclear weapons use and testing and waste. NB Obama approved a new generation of nukes! * the environmental damage from US missiles cf Syria, Libya, Yemen etc * all the US military bases around the world …etc… Evil mastermind election-hacker Putin’s country spends one-tenth of the US on its military (and still apparently manages to control the world!)

But Clinton playing victim to misogyny is insulting and misleading in a similar way to the attempt to shame Sanders supporters with the “there is a special place in hell for women who don’t support women candidates’ hypocrisy. I hate to say it but people who ignored disagreement with her policies, chose not to examine her ethics failures and in some cases her history of destructive incompetence in order to vote for the candidate with a vagina are also sexist. Then there is the fact that many of those supposedly misogynist Americans who failed to anoint her have female representation locally, at the state level and sometimes even at the federal level, Can it be misogyny if you are willing to be governed or represented by (shudder) a Mia Love or a Nikki Haley and reject Hillary Clinton?

Given the acrimony over the state of the Democratic Party, I suspect there are Clinton “loyalists” who are begging Hillary to come out and save them from those mean Bernie Bros. I know she likes the spotlight, but I feel she is being used to gin up support for otherwise unemployable people. Take Robbie Mook. He blew a billion dollars on the last election. Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 10:51 am You bet. But being more liberal than Clinton leaves them exposed as an isolated individual to the anger of big biz and the rich.

Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner June 2, 2017 at 11:25 am The values of a Clintonista aren’t as relevant as they are attached to a power couple who came to power 25 years ago and faced a strong challenge from a 73 year old Senator from a small out of the way state with no media presence (take that Brattleboro Reformer!) where the paper of record is the Boston Globe. If you weren’t old enough to vote for Bill in 1996, you didn’t vote for Hillary in the primary in 2016. If you were 17 and under last year during the primaries, you weren’t voting for a candidate of 25 years ago. Given the divisive nature of the primaries, all these people who threw their lot in with Clinton Inc separated themselves from the future for immediate rewards of the certainty Hillary would be President. Now they live in a world where the great liberal paper of record hired a bunch of climate change denialists and NBCNews is giving Megan Kelly a major platform to make sure black children understand Santa Claus is white. I see “OMG Russia” as the Clintonistas trying to hold on and deflect blame for their own failures because they don’t have good options as they have lost credibility. Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 4:09 pm Well, zOMG Russia!! is partly cos they wanna suck up to powerful neocons in the foreign policy establishment cos they think they wield enough power to crown Clinton or another centrist President in 2020, with the help of fired-up patriotic voters. Because they were already using “Russian hacking” and a demented Syrian-no-fly-zone policy to try and get into power in 2016. It’s not just a post-election excuse for defeat. Dumb to use it again when it failed in November, but the alternative is to move left and take on those interests instead, and they’re too scared. And it’s been in the nature of the Clintons just to brazen things out. Reply ↓ Pat June 2, 2017 at 11:00 am Parasite/host or symbiotic relationship? How many hosts invite their parasites to make a home? They aren’t feeding off the host supplying nothing, this is mutual support. The Clintons worked hard to create this twisted political world. But I am sure you are right there are sure to be a whole lot of people telling her ‘America needs her.’ And they are stuck with HER. She was supposed to acquire her desire and consolidate their power. Now they are scrambling. They spent years clearing the runways for her, and now that she has failed to lift off there is really no one in the wings. Oops.

And then you have the distillation of these tendencies in Trump. But as Noonan points out, a grown-up should expect the pricks of conscience, if the person has a conscience. Noonan’s good classical education pays off: The agenbite of inwit. The last sentence of the Wikipedia entry sheds intriguing light and shadow: “In the 20th century, the work gained some recognition when its title was adopted by James Joyce, who used it numerous times in his novel Ulysses as a trope for self-conscience, especially in referencing Hamlet and Walt Whitman. In Joyce’s spelling, agenbite of inwit, the title has gained a limited foothold in the English language.” Reply ↓ TK421 June 2, 2017 at 11:37 am Thanks! You are a scholar and a gentleman.

Instead we get self-serving denial and elaborate conspiracy theories like some sort of mental paranoia. Thank God that lady’s fingers are nowhere near the nuclear launch codes. Can she please just take her millions and go away? It seems like all Hillary knows how to do is punch down. Complaining about her data analyst staff. Whining about Trump’s fake Twitter followers when she had more fake ones than he did throughout the campaign, when she literally spent millions bankrolling a sock puppet operation — which is still ongoing, now rebranded as Share Blue. Seeing her repeatedly call WikiLeaks “Russian”, saying there’s “no difference”, this from the woman who reportedly asked why we couldn’t just “drone” Assange. Stomach-turning evil lunacy. To me it looks like she’s very closely involved in pumping the anti-Trump campaign. She recites the cant too well to not be dictating the talking points. If someone subpoena’d her cell phone they’d probably find a mountain of evidence. Meanwhile the corporate media regard themselves as her protectors and attack dogs, as they did throughout the campaign. Reply ↓ jan June 2, 2017 at 8:23 am Naomi Kleint and the Paris accord: The fact that the agreement only commits governments to keeping warming below an increase of 2 degrees, rather than a much safer firm target of 1.5 degrees, was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that the agreement left it to individual nations to determine how much they were willing to do to reach that temperature target, allowing them to come to Paris with commitments that collectively put us on a disastrous course towards more than 3 degrees of warming, was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that the agreement treats even these inadequate commitments as non-binding, which means governments apparently do not have anything to fear if they ignore their commitments, is something else that was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that the agreement specifically prohibits poor countries from seeking damages for the costs of climate disasters was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that it is an “agreement” or an “accord” and not a treaty — the very thing that makes it possible for Trump to stage his action-movie slow-mo walk away, world in flames behind him — was lobbied for and won by the United States.

He did not have senate support to ratify it as a binding treaty, so he chose to make it an “executive agreement” with his administration, with full knowledge that it was valid only for the remaining nine months of his final term. The President’s counterparties in Paris realized that he lacked the support to bind the country. In fact, they watered down the wording of the Agreement to facilitate the Administration’s argument that it does not require ratification. For example, they changed the word “shall” to “should” in many places, and they avoided calling it a “treaty.” The negotiators had a choice between a treaty that might bind the United States and nine-month promise from an outgoing president. They chose the promise from an outgoing president. Any claims that the next administration or the country is “going back on its word” will be disingenuous. Only the Obama administration gave its word, and the other parties in Paris helped design the agreement to make that result possible. http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/276668-president-obamas-signing-of-the-paris-agreement-is Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 2, 2017 at 5:58 pm D’accord, on the nine-month promise-accord.

Unpacking this explains everything you need to know about her failure to come to terms with her defeat. In other words, “What Defeat, I Won.” It’s simply a matter of correcting the record. I would like to know if her staff must address her as “Madam President” or if they have given her the nuclear codes to her dummy “football” or if she calls retired generals to discuss military strategy. Of course, her reaction is easy to explain. Her supporters and the MSM have also failed to accept the results.

This world we live in is certainly strange. ———————- I always think of Roald Dahl’s great short story, The Butler, when I see people buying wines like these. In that story, a nouveau riche couple tries to develop a taste for top end wines and meals to accompany their newfound millions and lavish lifestyle. They hire a butler and a French chef, then hold dinner parties with wildly expensive clarets of the very finest vintage. The husband develops a concordant ostentatious manner of waxing rhapsodic about the pricey wines they serve as if he’s an expert and as if the wines are the ultimate nectar from heaven. At the end of the story the butler ends up handing in his resignation and informs the man that he has been substituting the cheapest Spanish reds the whole time and drinking the top stuff with the chef!

Reply ↓ charles leseau June 2, 2017 at 12:46 pm The operative word there being “may.” I believe the point of the story is that they were serving up something that was demonstrably inferior to the couple, but then one would have to question whether there is any cheap Spanish red that could be called bad, or even worse than the most lauded of French wines in the most lauded years. Evidence about taste is in any case always going to lead to that dreaded word “subjective.” Certainly, one could compile enough people who think McDonalds is superior or equal to whatever the chef in the story (or any chef) could cook up too. And I’ve seen enough people in Guardian comments section arguing vehemently that Kanye West is a musical genius. Whether this puts him on the level of a Beethoven, Chopin, or Ellington? I know what I think of that, but no, I’m not going to argue about it no matter how much someone tries to spur me into it. To argue that all cheap Spanish reds are the equal to a top Bordeaux of one of the supposedly great years is thus fine, I guess. Anyone can argue anything along those lines with food or drink. Certainly, ever since the “Judgment of Paris” back in the 1970s people have been looking to knock French wine down a peg or 20. In any case, both the story and the idea that people have for centuries not been able to distinguish value or superiority in wine until apparently now does bring the purchase of a $140,000 bottle into question.

I hesitate to include Africans because most of them were not immigrants, but yes they too have added immeasurably to our culture. And yes there were regions (and still are) where the Irish controlled politics, where Asians controlled politics, where the Germans controlled the politics, where the Latinos controlled politics, etc…. I’m wondering what is so “exceptional” about the US that so many people think “everyone” will want to come here? It seems to me that they come here not because the US is “exceptional” but because the US and other countries have destroyed their countries……and there is no where else to go….. Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 10:39 am Ppl are concerned that economic growth may be helped by a growing population from immigrants, but per capita incomes would not. And ppl are loss-averse. I assume it has little effect either way, positive or negative. But since a “more mouths to feed, competing for our jobs” argument is simple and plausible, there will always be a big fraction of the public who oppose mass immigration. Enough to swing an election or two. As for cultural dominance, Alex was talking about completely free migration. That means a hell of a lot more cultural dominance than the Irish dominating politics in an American city of yesteryear. There is a language barrier: historically limits of immigration meant English has always been the national language. Completely open migration would change that, and it would be economically inconvenient. Then there is whether greater numbers would help or hinder public services and infrastructure. Even if you think so, you must admit voters’ fears over this would be a political problem, preventing other things getting done. Reply ↓ Alex June 2, 2017 at 12:34 pm Darn, thank you, that was indeed my point. I don’t think immigration is bad per se and certainly every country has been affected by it In addition to that I’d suggest the author to start not from the whole country but think about his town or neighbourhood and conduct a thought experiment – what kind of difficulties can arise and what kind of consequences follow from adding to the current population as many economic migrants that look different and have different culture. Like where would they live, where would they work (especially while they still don’t know the language), who would gain from such an influx etc Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 4:22 pm Yes. And at a time of economic stress (after 9 yrs since the Great Recession without full recovery for a large part of the population) ppl are gonna be more desperate for solutions and stopping immigration is an easy idea to grasp. The Brexit vote would never have got to 52% without this. Only partly about immigration, but it got them over the finish line. I don’t think MMT is necessary, but try getting a party for Keynesian stimulus into power when the first question you get asked on the doorstep is, “why don’t you just cut immigration?”. Personally I don’t think we have to sacrifice any votes or other policies just to keep immigration at the current level. Reply ↓ LT June 2, 2017 at 10:49 am There is no shortage of workers.

Reply ↓ clinical wasteman June 2, 2017 at 5:08 pm I’ve asked versions of this question before, and I can’t emphasise enough that — at least when commenting here — I NEVER mean it sarcastically or derisively*. Anyway, here’s one more iteration: “Why stop at ‘this country’ in that case? A hugely disproportionate amount of wealth (and with it, the chances for the non-wealthy to earn an income) circulates inside a few states and cities of the US (just as in Europe, India, China, etc.), but available space and physical resources in those places are limited. Is it also inevitable that New York, California, Bavaria, Guangdong and, say, the Federal District of Mexico must “close the doors” on “deplorables” from elsewhere in the larger federal/national territory? And isn’t that what eg. San Franscisco, Manhattan/Brooklyn, “petit Paris” and parts of London are already doing by way of a de facto “property qualification” for residence?** (*The impolite version — quoted here for information purposes only, because it’s only for use against those “closed doors” advocates who don’t sincerely detest exploitation and economic injustice, i.e. no-one I recall seeing on NC ever: “which do like better, the Chinese Hukou or the South African Pass Laws? Because the only difference between those ‘closed doors’ and ‘national’ ones is the size of the administrative entity.” (**Yes, the property qualification is technically non-discriminatory as well as conveniently deniable, but class cleansing, which is exactly what’s going on in those cities, is always also ethnic to one degree or another.) Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 7:01 pm An answer to your question — “class cleansing, which is exactly what’s going on in those cities, is always also ethnic to one degree or another” … Yes — I believe that is true. However I don’t believe ethnic cleansing is a root intent — it’s merely a by-product — not a goal per se. Money distribution in the U.S. is strongly tied to “ethnic” — dare I say race — backgrounds. Elsewhere. that is not so much the case — or at any rate the dominant “ethnic” background isn’t always the same as in the U.S. I believe — admittedly without evidence to point to — that the only “color” which matters for purchasing the astronomically priced real estate in too many cities of the U.S. is the color “Green”. [Some ethnic groups have to fight harder to get in than others but “Green” seems to overcome all but the most idiosyncratic obstacles.] Reply ↓ clinical wasteman June 3, 2017 at 7:38 pm Thanks Jeremy for the thoughtful observations. I agree that the ‘ethnic’ part may very well not be a a conscious aim of the cleansing, but that doesn’t seem to stop it happening, and it probably doesn’t matter much mid-eviction or when you know your kids will either have to live with you forever or leave town. Pursuit of “Green” is, as you say, the decisive intention, but the second-third-fourth-degree effects are almost always ‘ethnically’ skewed — or in practice, for those on the receiving end, racist — even if their landlords, bailiffs and bosses are untainted by prejudice deep in their hearts. With the many exceptions duly noticed (i.e. a few rich ‘minority’ brackets and many many ‘non-ethnic'(?!) poor), the ‘race’/power/class breakdown does broadly work that way here in London and elsewhere in the UK too, which is why the recent attempts to set (implicitly ‘white’) ‘working class’ and ‘ethnic/metropolitan’ pseudo-identities against each other — rhetorically expelling ‘minority’ and ‘metropolitan’ workers from our own class — trouble me so much.

And cut benefits to disabled people by £30 a week. Then let scaremongering right-wing newspapers do the heavy lifting. Another parallel is her speeches and literature have all said I I I, me me me.

Because the free education that Corbyn is promising will be paid for through the taxes which everybody in the working class has to pay so there’s no “giveaway” involved. Yet somehow when politicians create tax codes riddled with loopholes that let the rich and big corporations get away with paying no taxes whatsoever, that’s not ever construed as a giveaway but as sound fiscal policy that will trickle down to the rest of us.

Reply ↓ Left in Wisconsin June 2, 2017 at 5:43 pm One thing that is of course ignored by Vox is the decline in unionized construction. Not only did the unions insist on apprenticeship programs but the law was flexible enough to allow union workers to fill most of the lower level supervisory positions – so the front-line management actually knew the work. Not all that long ago, most of the big construction projects were still union – non-union was big in residential construction but barely present in big commercial projects. No longer. Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 9:38 pm I believe the Federal Government is captured and manifestly corrupt. But what little I’ve seen of state and local government leads me to believe the Federal Government is saintly by comparison. Every time I pass a state construction site with one or two “workers” present — trading a shovel back-and-forth — and surrounded by expensive heavy equipment parked around the worksite I can’t help but wonder how much my state pays to rent that sitting equipment [exclusive of the costs to commuters and transport companies — more often to individual truckers] for the delays the “construction” adds to the already horrible transit costs for traveling in my state. I believe even the most cursory investigation of our state transportation department, the governor’s office and/or the contracting my state does would considerably bolster the pockets of myriad defense attorneys while providing countless long-term tenants for our growing Prison Industrial Complex. We can’t repair infrastructure — without breaking the bank? Who are they trying to kid? Reply ↓ KFritz June 3, 2017 at 1:48 am Something not mentioned in the article: worker training. There may be a way to verify this as a culprit/contributory factor to US underperformance. The gold standard of American construction unions is the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The union and its client employers work well together to ‘produce’ workers who can perform at a high level. It would be interesting to find out whether the IBEW outperforms US construction workers, and/or performs as well as electrician counterparts in comparable nations. If the IBEW does outperform other American workers and compares well to other countries’ electricians, training is certainly one culprit. I’ve also heard, anecdotally, that the American system of contractors and subcontractors is much less efficient than vertically integrated ‘full service’ construction firms , which are the most common form in many other comparable countries.

Why should I feel ashamed? Google knows what I mean. Also, that map can’t be correct. Maybe those words have the highest rate of being misspelled, but I doubt it, because if it was pure frequency relative to attempts that they were looking at it is more likely that very uncommon and difficult words would be the most frequent (i.e. the sort people look up specifically because they’re so uncommon that educated people who might want to use, for example, “autochthonous,” need to look it up because it isn’t in autocorrect dictionaries). So they must have a reasonably high threshold of attempts to make the cut. Also, many of the most common spelling errors are those that google wouldn’t likely catch, because they’re grammatical in nature: affect and effect, they’re their and there, to and too, etc. Also, if it was just aggregate totals of misspellings, I’d bet double or nothing on my student loan debt that in each state the most often misspelled word is “the.” Also, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is a made-up silly word, and the only people who should be ashamed are those who actually think they know the “correct” spelling, and that that somehow matters.

How has it come to this? Reply ↓ Jim Haygood June 2, 2017 at 1:19 pm It started in 1984 under Ronald Reagan and Atty Genl William French Smith. Their diabolical plan was to crank federal sentences so absurdly high (multiple lifetimes in some instances) that most cases would be settled by plea bargains without trials. This vastly increased judicial processing capacity to feed an enlarged federal Gulag. Today about 95 percent of federal criminal cases produce guilty pleas which lead directly to sentencing. “Criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,” “Justice” Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in 2012. What passes for criminal justice today bears no resemblance to the pre-1984 system. They substituted a completely different regime, in which going to trial amounts to gambling with the rest of your life, and no one noticed. Current attorney general Ku Klux Jeff Sessions just ordered drug defendants to be whacked with maximum charges. You can see why “we” love Saudi Arabia — a medieval regime with savage punishments and zero rights for defendants.

And in my opinion, most of the state judges I’ve observed (admittedly not all that many) seem afraid to do anything that steps outside Draconian sentencing guidelines established by the state legislature [both Republican AND Democratic legislators]. And, in my humble opinion, prosecutors have little interest in “Justice” — only in improving their chances for promotion within the “system” while minimizing any “risks” they might face for being “too lenient”. This harsh way of things may have started with post-1984 “justice” but they continue — live and well — to this moment.

Without a doubt, it was not Islam that drove young Europeans to crusade. Saladin and his soldiers were just minding their business in their sphere of influence. Reply ↓ Plenue June 2, 2017 at 2:54 pm Both of those views can be simultaneously accurate. There are a whole lot of people, particularly Muslims, who consider Wahhabism in general, and ISIS in particular, to be takfiri apostates, not real Muslims. Certainly the vast majority of the Syrians, Iraqis, and Kurds fighting and dying everyday to stop ISIS and AQ are also Muslim. Wahhabism is so disdained by the majority of Muslims that there’s apparently a widespread conspiracy theory in the middle-east that it was created by the British and/or the CIA as a Trojan horse to undermine Islamic and Arab unity. Personally I find it all a bit No True Scotsman-y. The fact is that in the end the head-choppers consider themselves Muslims who are doing what they believe Allah wants them to do. But it’s also true that a whole lot of the people, particularly Europeans, who sign up for ISIS are apparently so grossly ignorant of the basics of Islam that they had to buy ‘Islam for Dummies’ type books. https://apnews.com/9f94ff7f1e294118956b049a51548b33/islamic-state-gets-know-nothing-recruits-and-rejoices So while Wahhabism is undeniably a branch of Islam, and is the driving ideology of jihadist movements, that doesn’t necessarily mean any kind of piety is what is driving a large number of people to sign up with jihadist groups. Also, Jihad in the sense of a military expedition doesn’t strike me as demonstrably different from a Crusade. And I’ve seen the argument that the Crusades were fundamentally a belated response to the initial Islamic incursions into Europe; they didn’t just happen completely without provocation. But regardless, it’s also clear that the Levant was basically the Wild West for Europeans, and many people signed up in the hope of getting land and riches.

You mean the crusades were a response to the Muslims taking over Spain and failing to invade France…. THREE centuries before? The Muslims invaded western Europe in the 700s. The first crusade was in 1096. The Muslims hadnt taken jack since then. And the crusade wasn’t even focused on Spain, which was indeed actually taken from Christendom, but on the Muslim heartland. Forgive me if I’m skeptical of this hypothesis. Oh yeah, and it also doesn’t explain the fourth crusade, which was aimed at…. Orthodox Greece. I’m pretty sure that explanation is just too facile.

If anything the crusades made Eastern Europe less safe when the Catholics decided it would be way easier to get loot and plunder by ransacking the Byzantine Empire instead of trying to take Jerusalem back the second time.

Her tenure on the national board’s executive committee is believed to have helped Microsoft, based in Seattle, at a crucial time. In 1980, she discussed her son’s company with John Opel, a fellow committee member and the chairman of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Opel, by some accounts, mentioned Mrs. Gates to other IBM executives. A few weeks later, IBM took a chance by hiring Microsoft, then a small software firm, to develop an operating system for its first personal computer.

At the time, IBM’s mainframe division was king of the company, and they had only released their first midrange computers in 1979. In 1981 personal computers were so under powered compared to what exists today, it’s possible that the IBM executives simply did not believe that the PC would become a major product line.

Belongs here: reslez June 2, 2017 at 6:15 pm I wonder how the Genghis Kahn invasion of the 1300s fit in. The kings of Western Europe were pretty tapped out by that time and only a modest number of troops were raised at noblemen level to defend Western Europe, and they barely pushed into Eastern territory. Plus they had to split and go north to Poland and south east. The Crusaders were still around but not a huge force and they had begun to be under attack from the Church and supportive kings at that time. The only reason the Kahn boys won was Genghis killed his liver, and law recalled the troops back to the homeland to settle the succession. They never did return west, and I haven’t seen any good reason why, other than they just lost interest. Reply ↓ craazyboy June 2, 2017 at 10:58 pm Back to the subject. I’m pretty sure that’s it. I think Gates has confirmed as much, also. IBM was really that dumb. Or had their heads in the Mainframe cloud. PCs were toys, to be made for hobbyists, maybe in garages, with silly names like “Apple”. Or, Altair – Bill’s first employer – and was a hobbyist machine. Basic was the language – not so impressive to a mainframer either. Then Paul Allen was known as the grownup in the room.

It would also be useful if the US was a true democracy so that it could get what the people want which is single payer. “”Economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial impacts on government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The scholars’ (Gilens and Page) findings seriously challenge the idea that, as a type of society, the United States is democratic. If a semblance of democracy is reached, it is usually because the rabble has exerted pressure on decision-makers through extra-electoral means – strikes, riots, demonstrations, civil disobedience, even insurgencies; in other words, because they’ve rejected the constraints of the electoral arena and moved the competition to the streets, where the constraints of procedural democracy no longer obtain.”” (Washington’s Long War on Syria) Reply ↓ financial matters June 3, 2017 at 5:45 am This discussion was in light of contrasting the ‘democracies’ of the US and Syria. As an underdeveloped nation struggling against powerful opponents, Syria gives priority to the Ba’ath party as being in favor of Arab secular nationalism. “”In effect ,then, the difference between presidential elections in Syria, under its 1973 constitution, and the United States today, is that presidential candidates in the former were chosen by Arab nationalists to carry out the country’s Arab nationalist mission, while in the latter, the candidates are chosen by the U.S. capitalist class to carry out the country’s capitalist-based imperialist mission. The Syrian system at least had the advantage of representing Syrians en masse as part of an oppressed Arab nation. By contrast, the U.S system almost ineluctably leads to the selection of candidates who have a high probability of being committed to policies that favor their country’s wealthiest citizens at the expense of the voters who elected them.”” (ibid) Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 9:17 pm I think Weber’s analysis is too limited to explain why we don’t have single payer.

Otherwise I don’t understand why they think its a good idea to raise the rents so high that no business would want to rent there… Reply ↓ Oregoncharles June 2, 2017 at 1:40 pm Did anyone say they were smart? But they might indeed be trying to empty the building for a rebuild. Reply ↓ WeakenedSquire June 2, 2017 at 2:10 pm As long as the space remains vacant, it’s a tax writeoff for the landlord. And even if it takes 4-5 years to fill it, the expectation is that eventually an international retailer will pay the full asking price for a at least a few years, and that will make the wait worth it. You never know when that tenant will come along, either–so best have inventory ready and not tied up in a lease to a struggling mom-and-pop. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 2, 2017 at 2:35 pm That strategy calls for an all-cash buyer/landlord, or an owner having access to practically 0% financing. Just one more way the Fed is doing for or to America. Reply ↓ HotFlash June 4, 2017 at 6:06 pm Dunno how it is there, but here (Ontario) commercial leases are voided on sale of the property. New owner, therefore new lease — or not, of course. Residential leases may also be voided, if the buyer is moving family in. I got evicted once that way, although the buyer lied. But I digress. We have lots of commercial properties here, landlords have jacked up the rent and if tenants can’t cough up, vacancy. Currently, the city reduces property taxes for vacant commercial property, and of course, with no income there is no income tax for the owner. Sometimes the places stay vacant for a long time. In my neighbourhood (Parkdale, yes that Parkdale) we are seeing our local coffee shops, bookstores, hairdressers, greengrocers, ethnic food and clothing shops, and barbers replaced with galleries, martini bars, cannabis clinics and (tada!) a 24-hour A&W. Are we going upscale or down? I can’t tell, but it sure is getting different around here.

Reply ↓ crittermom June 2, 2017 at 2:03 pm RE: healthcare/single payer in CA. Isn’t it convenient how the figures can be skewered to make healthcare for all appear impossible? I live in another state. I just received my first bill from the hospital. It was for the tests back in March, before I even began my treatments for Stage III breast cancer. Treatments will be ongoing through the winter, with 5 yrs of estrogen therapy to follow beginning next year when I’ve finished all other procedures. (I now have to wonder how much big pharma will charge for the Estrogen?) Despite having Medicare (I’m 65) plus “the best Medicaid supplement” I’m allowed (which, BTW, doesn’t cover one penny of this), this one bill alone amounts to exactly half my monthly income–despite the $134 mth the govt takes out of my SS for Medicare. All for one day of tests. I called the billing ofc and told ’em they’d better hope I live to be 200, as that’s the only way they’ll get repaid if I’m going to receive bills like this over the coming years. I’m already considered “below extreme poverty level” with just my SS for income. And the Drs wonder why I’m now suffering some depression? Now my car insurance is going up due to the extra miles I’m putting on it to travel to my treatments, despite my clean driving record. Yeah. Ain’t America grand, where healthcare is a privilege and not a right? So, so sad that Bernie was never given an honest chance to win… Reply ↓ reslez June 2, 2017 at 6:52 pm Ain’t that America, where the people are Free and health care is Expensive. How we handle this in the US is by setting up pity pageants on GoFundMe where sick people can portray themselves as deserving of care and donations, the more photogenic the better. But if you do set up a gofundme, or something like it, I hope you post it here so those of us who are able can help. The system is rotten. All we can do is make the world a little brighter for each other. Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 8:08 pm First question — why doesn’t Medicare or your Medicare Supplement cover the costs of your tests? I’m asking because I wondered why my Medicare Supplement insurer was trying to sell me additional insurance for cancer. What gives? I’m appalled at the costs of medical care in our country but two costs particularly anger me. The first is the cost for hospital care along with the endless hospital subcontractors who pile-on their charges. The second cost — which most particularly relates to your comment — is the totally outrageous costs for lab tests. Lab tests require a location, a low-paid phlebotomist and an overpriced piece of medical equipment. That overpriced piece of medical equipment is often old and probably paid-off in the first few months it runs. There are overpriced reagents and overpriced repairs and maintenance items … but the providers keep a fat part of the charges they make for each test. I believe that in the worst case a state could buy some of this equipment and hire some civil service phlebotomists, pay them well and give them benefits and retirement, and still end up making embarrassing amounts of money for the state coffers while cutting the charges for lab work in half. Most/[all?] states license medical doctors to practice medicine and to some/[full?] extent could control the costs for various treatments. Given the ready willingness to undercut the “market” for engineers and nurses [RNs] through H1B Visas I have often wondered at the remarkable power of the doctor’s union — the AMA. A state like California could make single payer very affordable by modifying a few state laws. Physicians can reasonably and should complain about the outrageous costs of medical school and malpractice insurance and the overheads associated with insurance billing systems. These costs are all under some/[full?] control of a state. Each state has considerable leverage to make single payer work. But who controls the levers? Finally — I hope all comes out well for you. My mother had breast cancer in her early 30’s and it affected her, and her family deeply. I was 13 years old at the time and mostly fussed about getting stuck doing the family dishes. It’s taken years — many many years to grasp even a small part of how this disease devastated my mother. Reply ↓ pzoe June 2, 2017 at 2:52 pm I’m so amused by Hillary’s often stated claim that she really won because she won the popular vote. Reporters echo this mindlessly. I’ve never seen anyone refute this. Hello, it’s the Electoral College, stupid. As every educated marketing person knows one develops a strategy towards winning by winning with the score that counts. For the US Presidency what counts is electoral college votes, not popular votes. So you concentrate your campaign, spend your money, focus your efforts, visits, etc. with the view o fwinning those electoral states. One doesn’t spend time in states where you can get lots of votes but lose. A simile is the 1960 World series where the NY Yankees absolutely dominated in the “runs scored” column but lost in the game score. The Yankees won three games by huge margins but Pittsburgh won its four games and the series by lesser run margins. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether June 2, 2017 at 3:13 pm Yes, I’ve never understood why losing the game by rules you knew going in is considered virtuous. The odd thing is that the failure mirrors 2008’s Democrat primary, where Clinton pulled even with the popular vote, won all the large states, but butchered the delegate count, apparently because they didn’t know how caucus states worked. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 2, 2017 at 3:16 pm Girl made underclassman kowtow to her. From Kowtow, courtesy of Wikipedia: Kowtow, which is borrowed from kau tau in Cantonese (koutou in Mandarin Chinese), is the act of deep respect shown by prostration, that is, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one’s head touching the ground. An alternative Chinese term is ketou; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: kou (叩) has the general meaning of knock, whereas ke (磕) has the general meaning of “touch upon (a surface)”, tou (頭) meaning head. The date of this custom’s origin is probably sometime between the Spring and Autumn Period, or the Warring States Period of China’s history because it is already known to have been a custom by the time of the Qin Dynasty (221 BCE – 206 BCE).[citation needed] Did the underclassman have to prostrate and make a knocking sound on the ground?

Hillary lost and Trump won. Why is it so hard to get past the strange events of 2016? True — it is wise to learn from history. But when will November 2016 fade into a moment of history instead of a cluster-point for thrashing about? I disagree with you about there being too many links. I would prefer the more to less. I can pick through this level of links to find what I’m really interested in. I would be very hard pressed to sift through the web to find what is of value.

Schools as we know them are obsolete and are indeed a waste of tax money and the human capital that keeps the machine going.

Posted By Jane Danes on Jun 3, 2017 | 0 comments Share the joy                 Source: https://pixabay.com/en/entrepreneur-idea-competence-vision-1340649/ As a website owner, you would want your site to be visible to your potential customers. One way to do that is to rank better on Google. You need your pages to appear on top of the Google search result. In this post, let’s take a look at ways on how to improve your search engine ranking using social media marketing. Find where your customers are If you want to stabilize your rankings, you must find where your potential customers are. It’s reported that almost three billion people are using social media. The number is up by 22 percent. Hence, most businesses are investing in social media. They even train their employees to handle their customer service on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. If you failed to respond through social media channels, your existing customers are more likely to switch provider. Since your goal is to improve your search engine ranking, you need more people to talk about your brand. You can’t achieve that if your customers aren’t satisfied with your company. But if they’re pleased with how you interact with them on social media, they’re likely to talk about you on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. And the more they talk about you; the more Google would recognize your company. Post links on social media The primary objective of Google is to provide the most relevant results to the users. When you search something on Google, you could see that it displays authority pages on top of the SERP. Although Google doesn’t utilize social signal to rank your web pages, it does treat social media sites like other pages. Thus, if a topic occurs on Twitter and it can crawl it, Google returns it in its search results. Therefore, when your customers post your website links on popular media sites, you could expect your ranking to boost because these links are considered as credible backlinks. It could lead to better page ranks. Get better traffic As mentioned earlier, social media has billions of users. Thus, it has become a useful tool for marketers to boost their website’s ranking. You can quickly drive targeted traffic to your site through Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter and other popular social media sites. The more traffic you get from these sites, the better it is for your ranking. That’s because Google recognizes massive referral traffic as an indication that your site is reputable. The larger your followers are on social media, the more they could help in improving click through. The more posts you share on social media, the more search engines would think that your content has value. But make sure that you include keywords in your posts so that your target audience could find your posts. When your readers find your content on social media, they will visit your site. If they love your content, they would share it on social media. Doing so would help increase the authenticity of those click-throughs, thereby, improving your site statistics. This, too, could help your site rank better on Google. Develop True Relationships With Followers But to increase your followers, you need to develop relationships. To earn a genuine relationship with your fans, you should earn their trust and respect. For it to last, you need to give them something of value, and they do something for you, too. It’s useless to have thousands of followers on Twitter if they don’t communicate with you. To nurture a relationship on social media, you need to make people feel that you value them. Once they feel that, they are most likely to connect with you and be loyal to your brand. You must have an ongoing dialogue with them to reinforce that feeling. You need to deliver value if you want that relationship to grow and be stable over time. Since social media is a community, you must contribute to it in various ways and recognize other people’s contributions. You can do so by promoting other brands or people’s videos by liking, replying or retweeting/sharing them on your social media accounts or blog posts. Be Trustworthy Why would someone visit your website when they see it on social media if you don’t appear to be trustworthy? The success of every brand relies on trust. To start earning that trust, your messages on social media must be authentic. You must always be yourself whether you’re speaking about your organization or your products. On social media, you should be a thoughtful and supportive member of the community. And don’t forget to exhibit a funny bone to help you keep in good standing. Bear in mind that having a great sense of humor is always an effective ice breaker. Listen to your customers Intentional listening should be a part of your social media marketing. When you do so, you can find your target audience and be able to understand their needs. After that, you can effectively communicate with them in a way that it can establish trust and long-lasting relationship. To do so, spend your time learning on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites to know more about your target audience and what they’re saying about you and other brands. It’s also ideal that you monitor your competitors carefully. Know about what marketing messages they share on social media. Find out if they’re listening to their customers. Plan Before you even jump right in the social media marketing because it’s proven to boost search engine ranking, you need to develop a plan first. Make sure that you know how to integrate social media into your existing strategy. After listening to your audience, you’ll know what your target market cares about and what your potential customers are talking on social media. From that information, you can determine the kind of message that you can share and communicate with those people. As your social media followers grow, it’ll improve your brand’s relevance. It can lead to a better number of individuals reaching out to your brand and commenting on your posts regularly. You must learn how to fully engage your audience, so they keep talking about you.

Google Home is coming to Canada on June 26th, pre-orders available now via Google and Best Buy Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 9:11am PDTJun 2, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Google Google Home News Videos Google Assistant debuted last year in Allo, but it wasn't until Assistant arrived on the Pixel and Google Home that we really got to see what it could do. However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

I wonder if they are going to be opening up that restriction anytime soon... G-Money41 I'm curious about the same thing - or whether it will be able to accommodate both French and English users at the same time. I would prefer to use the Home in French, while my wife would prefer to use it in English. So far, we've compromised by using MY account, but with HER preferred language on our (US-bought) Home.

DazPowerz Are there any rumours so far about the Google Home 2? I wouldn't want to buy in a system I know might get upgraded in the next few months... needa I wouldn't buy a system that you have to shout at anyways. Wait for 2 no matter what. George WHAT?!? Abhilash Bingi The hardware it packs is plenty for the next couple of years at least, and most of the updating is done on the cloud anyway. Look at the Amazon Echo, it launched 2 years before the Google Home, but still hasn't been upgraded.

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Business updated: 6/3/2017 7:33 AM Is Apple ready to enter the home hub market? Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close Amazon and Google currently dominate the home hub market. (AP File Photo/Jeff Chiu)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Speculation over what Apple will do to compete in the home hub market is spinning up ahead of Apple's annual developer's conference, where many analysts expect Apple will confirm the project. And what will be the Apple home hub's distinguishing feature? It may be sound quality, according a report from Bloomberg. The Siri-infused speaker will really focus on producing quality surround sound and may also have a feature that can measure the room it's in and adjust its sound accordingly, the report said. While there were not any details on how this room-adapting feature works, it sounds similar to one already on Sonos speakers, called TruePlay, which uses the microphone in an iOS device to measure a room. Apple declined to comment on the report. Focusing on sound quality would give Apple an advantage, particularly given its historical strength in music, if it moves to another front in its war against Google and Amazon. Both firms already have smart speakers on the market that integrate with their own services, but are somewhat lacking when it comes to sound quality. Still, it will be stiff competition. Both Google and Amazon are continually adding features to their devices and the voice assistants they house. Google, at its own developers conference, announced that its Google Home will work with more devices, thanks to a Bluetooth connection, as well as even deeper integration with its own services. And Amazon on Thursday announced that its Echo line of smart home hubs now lets users further customize their reminders and timers on the device -- a small but useful update for two core uses of these devices. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Apart from focusing on sound quality, Apple will also have to find ways to leverage its own ecosystem of services -- iTunes, the App Store, HomeKit, Siri and more -- to convince potential buyers that its hub is right for them. It's not yet clear how it will do this, though Bloomberg reports there will be "deep integration" with Apple services. However, contrary to prior reports from analysts, the Bloomberg report said there will not be a screen on Apple's home hub. That could mean it won't compete, as expected, with Amazon's recent Echo Look -- a home hub that allows for video calling and potentially threatens Apple's FaceTime. Still, Apple has laid some groundwork in the home hub space before, by allowing some smart home devices such as light bulbs to be controlled through its Apple TV, and prominently featuring its own apps for the living room. A smart speaker that builds on what Apple TV has offered would give users more flexibility to decide where to place their home hub.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

The update also added the ability to assign names to different timers for better management.  ( Amazon Echo | Twitter ) The Alexa-powered Amazon Echo smart speaker is ruling the markets since it first debuted in 2016. Compared to the Google Home, the Echo is always a step ahead in its features and capabilities. However, a very basic functionality, which both devices lacked, was the ability to set reminders. Earlier in May, Google's leaked APK files revealed that the company was finally working on the reminder feature and would update its smart speaker soon. Amazon has once again beaten Google to release the reminder functionality. Alexa will now be able to set reminders for any appointments, events, and activities. Amazon Echo Users Will Now Be Able To Set Reminders The update was released on Thursday, June 1. Following this update, Echo users will now be able to able to set reminders simply with their voices. For instance, a user can say "Alexa, remind me to watch Game of Thrones at 9 p.m. on July 16," and the Echo will alert them of the same when the time comes. When the reminder is due, a blue light ring will appear on the Echo before Alexa reminds the users of the assigned alert. It is important to note that reminders are device specific, which means that the reminder set on your Amazon Echo at home will not be able to alert you of the same through the Echo device in your office. The syncing feature is not yet supported, but may be added at a later point. Users will also not be able to sync the reminder list from third-party apps, such as Todoist. In such cases, users will have to manually make each of the reminders on the smart speaker, if they so desire. Amazon Echo Update To Timers Currently, Echo owners were using the timer feature to set reminders. It was an easy way of doing so in absence of the real Reminder functionality. However, reminders through timers could only be set for the same day and not for the future. Amazon has also updated the timer functionality on its speaker. Users will now be able to name the timers set, which is a handy addition for people who have more than one timer set at a time. For instance, people cooking multiple dishes may now ask the Echo to set up each timer with the name of their corresponding dishes. For example, users can say "Alexa, set a pizza timer" and can even check on these timers by simply saying "Alexa, how much time is left on the pasta timer?" Both the features the new update adds will likely satisfy the smart speaker's users, as Amazon shared that named timers and reminders were the most requested functionalities for the Echo.

You'll be able to get one soon. Samsung Galaxy S8 launch Samsung Galaxy S8 looks amazing, but we have big questions Samsung Galaxy S8 gives Samsung a second chance Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked Samsung's first Wi-Fi system, the Connect Home, will be available for preorder at Best Buy on June 4 at $170 for a single unit or $380 for a pack of three units. (Pricing and availability for the UK and Australia are not yet available, but $170 is about £130 or AU$230.) The Connect Home is a midtier (2x2 MU-MIMO 802.11ac) system that's very similar to the Google Wifi. If you get a pack of three, one unit connects to your broadband modem and the rest of the units work as network extenders, making a seamless Wi-Fi network with a large coverage area. Each of its identical units has two network ports. In similar products with this design, the goal has been to make it easier for the average consumer to cover an entire home with a strong wireless networking signal. Also available for preorder on June 4 is the Connect Home Pro that costs $250 per unit. The Connect Home Pro shares the design and features of the Connect Home but supports the top-tier Wi-Fi spec (4x4 MU-MIMO 802.11ac) and hence has much faster Wi-Fi speeds. You can get up to five Pro units to setup a home mesh, or use it interchangeably with as other Connect Home units. An all-in-one mobile app Like other Wi-Fi systems, the Connect Home is connected to a mobile app you use to set up and manage your home network. Samsung has some big ambitions for this app, however. Apart from managing the Wi-Fi network it will also enable users to manage -- including the setup process -- Samsung-branded smart household devices, ranging from cameras to large appliances. The router also works as a hub for Samsung's SmartThings home automation system, and the app will let you program and control SmartThings-compatible devices from third-party product makers. Each Samsung Smart Connect home hardware unit is compact and has two network ports. Joshua Goldman/CNET The SmartThings twist This unified approach has been a long time coming. Since Samsung acquired SmartThings in August 2014, this is the first time Samsung has united its own connected large appliances with SmartThings-compatible products in the same hub hardware and support application. This means you won't need a separate SmartThings Hub anymore. Samsung says the new Connect Home has built-in Zigbee and Z-Wave -- popular light-weight wireless standards for home automation -- and is compatible with hundreds of third-party smart home devices, such as Philips Hue Lights, Netgear Arlo Camera and Ring Video Doorbell. If the device and the software work as expected, you will just need the Connect Home to control your entire home, and have Wi-Fi at every corner. It's a win-win.

Here are 16 of the most useful apps for Google Home. Smart Home by Taylor Martin June 2, 2017 3:15 PM PDT @caspertek Google introduced Actions for Google Home, third-party integrations that work a lot like skills for Alexa, back in January. Since then, the list of available services -- now called Assistant apps -- has grown, giving users access to additional news sources, food or book recommendations and much more. Unlike Alexa skills, third-party services for Google Home ($109.99 at Dell Home) just work. To use them, you only need to know the invocation, which can be found in the Google Home app under More settings > Assistant apps. We've included some examples below, too. Here are 30 of the best Assistant apps you should already be using. Update, June 2: Originally published on February 8, 2017, this article is regularly updated to include new Assistant apps and new information. 5 most useful Google Home commands As a voice assistant, Google Home is supposed to make your life easier. Here are five of the most useful commands to try. by Taylor Martin 2:51 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Food and recipes Whether it's ordering a meal or asking for recipe recommendations, smart speakers have naturally become kitchen companions. Google Home is no exception. You can order Dominos with Google Home simply by saying, "OK Google, let me talk to Dominos," or, "OK Google, talk to Dominos and get my Easy Order." You can also track an order you've placed by saying, "OK Google, talk to Dominos and track my order." With the Food Network app, you can ask for recipes by specific chefs, what shows are coming on tonight or even to get the recipe for what's currently on TV. Just say, "OK Google, ask Food Network to send me the recipes on TV right now," and if there is a recipe on the show playing for your time zone, it will be sent straight to your inbox. Drinks My Wine Guide will give you wine pairings for your favorite foods. Just ask to talk to My Wine Guide and the app will walk you through pairings for the meal you're preparing. Tender can suggest cocktails for you, walk you through making a drink or even tell you what's in a certain cocktail. For suggestions, say, "OK Google, ask Tender for drinks like a mojito." Another similar app is called The Bartender. Beer Guide will tell you about your favorite beers, or beers you'd like to try. Just say, "OK, Google, tell me about [beer name]," and Beer Guide will tell you the brewer, type of beer, its ABV and give a short description of the beer. Smart home Google is hellbent on adding support for a growing list of smart home brands. Several are directly integrated with Google Home, such as Lifx, Philips Hue, Nest, SmartThings and WeMo. But many more smart home brands have added support for Google Home with Assistant apps. The Geneva Home app allows you to control your GE smart appliances with Google Home. Preheat the oven, heat water for coffee, ask when the dishwasher will finish, ask if the dryer is finished and much more. Just say, "OK, Google, let me talk to Geneva Home." Likewise, the LG app allows you to check the status of the dishwasher, set the AC temperature or start your robot vacuum. Ring allows you to control your home security with Google Home. Turn on motion alerts, begin a recording or check your last notification. Say something like, "OK, Google, ask Ring about the last time my doorbell rang." Similarly, using Harmony, you can control your home entertainment system using your voice. Turn on the TV, start up Netflix and more. August recently added support for door locks. You can use Google Home to lock your doors or check on the status of a specific lock. Unfortunately, you cannot yet unlock doors with August using Google Home. Cars Blue Link by Hyundai allows you to remotely control compatible vehicles using Google Home. You will need to link your MyHyundai account and provide a PIN when interacting with the app, but you will be able to remotely start your car and set the AC temperature, send directions to the navigation unit and control the charging state of your hybrid. Mercedes me is a similar app for Mercedes owners. You can remotely set the temperature, start the car and lock the doors. Health The WebMD app is exactly what you would expect, a voice-controlled version of the website. You can ask about conditions, specific drugs or side effects. Your dog's health is important, too, and Dr. Doggy can tell you if the treat you want to give your dog is safe or not. Say, "OK Google, ask Dr. Doggy if it's safe for my dog to eat apples." 5-minute plank does exactly what you would think -- it walks you through a common 5-minute plank workout. To get started, just say, "OK, Google, let me talk to 5-minute plank." Movies and books If you're looking for something to watch, And Chill can give you recommendations based on another movie you like and why you like it, such as the twist at the end or the suspense. The itcher app recommends movies, as well, but it can also recommend books. Link your Google and itcher accounts to get even more personalized, community-based recommendations. To check the critics' rating for a movie before you watch it, use Tomato Reviews. It pulls ratings from Rotten Tomatoes. Just say, "OK, Google, talk to Tomato Reviews about 'Split.'" Games To start up a game of blackjack, just say, "OK Google, let me talk to 21 Blackjack." You will be dealt a hand and you can choose to hit or stand. The game keeps a record of your wins and losses. You can also ask for advice and for the official rules. Akinator the genie is the classic guessing game. You choose a character and Akinator asks you a series of questions until it can guess your character. It's not often you can stump the genie. The Magic Door is a choose-your-own-adventure story game that's filled with hidden items and riddles. To start, just say, "OK Google, open the magic door." Bots that can hold a conversation Clever Girl is an artificially intelligent conversational bot based on Cleverbot. Start a conversation by saying, "OK Google, talk to Clever Girl." Then you can carry on a conversation as long as you'd like. If you'd rather talk with real people, Random Conversations allows you to talk with random Google Home users. You record short messages that are then transcribed and read back to whomever the recipient is. You can carry on a conversation with the same person -- or multiple people (separately) -- sort of like digital pen pals. And other random apps To hear about the newest products for the day, ask to talk to Product Hunt. It will give you the top three products by default, and more products if you ask. AutoVoice allows you to create your own commands for Google Home. It requires the AutoVoice and Tasker Android apps, as well as a fair amount of setup. But once it's up and running, the sky is the limit. Cool Events pulls events from TicketMaster, MeetUps, SeatGeek and EventBrite. Just ask for Cool Events and specify your location. Tell it which source you'd like to hear about events from and it will list all nearby events. Date Night will provide you with suggestions for what to do on your next date. From going skinny-dipping to checking out a farmer's market and cooking a meal with what you buy or buying each other new fragrances, anything to switch up date night will be a welcome change. The eBay Assistant app can give you the value of items. Say something like, "OK, Google, ask eBay what an Apple Watch is worth." It will ask whether it's new or used and give you an approximate value for how much it's worth. If you're unhappy with the way Google Home handles shopping lists, your best bet is to use OurGroceries. It will require you to create an OurGroceries account, but you will be able to manage multiple shopping lists and view them from the mobile apps or from the web. Say, "OK, Google, ask OurGroceries to add milk to [list name]," or, "OK, Google, ask OurGroceries to remove eggs from [list name]." While you can check on flight prices with Google Home out of the box, you can't check on hotels or rental cars. That's where the Kayak app comes in. Just say, "OK, Google, ask Kayak to find new travel destinations," or, "OK, Google, find a hotel in New York City." We publish a new Google Home tip every week.

According to a report in BuzzFeed, Waymo’s self-driving truck was spotted in a photo and the development was later confirmed by the company. A spokesperson from Waymo — Google’s self-driving car arm — said that it took “eight years of experience in building self-driving hardware and software and conducting a technical exploration into how our technology can integrate into a truck.” Safety was the focus of the expansion into the sector, the spokesperson said, with the aim of reducing “thousands of trucking-related deaths each year”. Waymo confirmed that it was only testing one vehicle at the moment and it was still manually driving it on a public road in order to collect data. Its rival Uber has already delivered its first shipment in a self-driving freight vehicle last August — a short time after it bought trucking startup Otto for $680 million. Waymo and Uber became fierce rivals when the former sued and filed a lawsuit against the latter for allegedly stealing trade secrets and self-driving technology from it. The lawsuit argued that former Waymo manager Anthony Levandowski took information when he left the company and later co-founded Otto in January 2016. Earlier this week, Uber fired Levandowski for allegedly stealing some 14,000 documents from Waymo.

According to cyber security firm Check Point, dozens of malicious apps were downloaded between 4.5 million to 18.5 million times from the Play Store. Some of the malware-affected apps have been discovered residing on the online store for several years. “Judy” is one such case of how an open and free mobile operating system (OS) can be exploited by malicious app developers. Most security flaws we hear about now affect old builds of the OS or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security, technology website extremetech.com reported on Friday.The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $2,00,000. Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who demonstrate an exploit, get a cash prize — the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000, the report said.

Visitors to Google’s homepage might be asking themselves, who was Josephine Baker and how she become one of the first African-American artists and Civil Rights Movement activists, who dedicated her life to bring a significant change in the society? Born as Freda Josephine McDonald, Josephine Baker was a French vedette singer and entertainer, whose career was centered primarily in Europe, and mostly in France. She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, in the early 1900’s and began dancing and singing with the Jones Family Band and Dixie Steppers. At the age of 13, Josephine started working as a waitress at the Old Chauffeur’s Club at 3133 Pine Street. She also lived as a street child in the slums of St. Louis, sleeping in cardboard shelters, scavenging for food in garbage cans, making a living with street-corner dancing. Baker made her way to the New York City and joined the chorus of the musical Shuffle Along. However, the worldwide recognition she got was from her visit to Paris, where she finally became a jazz icon and found her new true home. As the star of the musical show La Revue Nègre, Josephine Baker became famous for appearing on stage wearing a banana skirt and little else. Happy Birthday to Josephine Baker. Civil Rights activist , Jazz pioneer and the first woman of African decent to become world famous. pic.twitter.com/C92KiJsBfC — ʎɐz (@thebigcelery) June 3, 2017 I'm obsessed with google's Josephine Baker doodle today pic.twitter.com/XofjuEXeWv — kate gabrielle (@kategabrielle) June 3, 2017 According to the book Josephine: The Hungry Heart written by her foster son Jean-Claude Baker, in later shows in Paris, she was often spotted on stage with her pet cheetah, who was jeweled with a diamond collar. After a few stunts and her exotic dance steps, she became the most successful American entertainer working in France. Ernest Hemingway once called her “the most sensational woman anyone ever saw.” Aside from her exotic costumes that once became the talk of the town, she is being celebrated today by Google for her work towards female liberation and her extensive work during World War II. [Image by Francois Mori/AP Images] When France declared war on Germany in September 1939, Josephine Baker was recruited by the Deuxième Bureau — French military intelligence — as an “honorable correspondent.” Given her position as an entertainer, she was invited to attend parties, during which she gathered information at the Italian embassy without raising any suspicions on her part. After the war, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French military and was named a Chevalier of the Legion d’honneur by General Charles de Gaulle. Over the years, this jazz icon has been compared to Beyoncé for her stunning physique as well as Angelina Jolie for her many adoptions from around the world, both of whom she predates. Josephine Baker started supporting the Civil Rights Movement during 1950. According to Rose Phyllis’ Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time, when she arrived in New York along with her husband Jo, they were refused reservations at 36 hotels because of her ethnicity. [Image by AP Images] By this racial discrimination, she was so upset that she wrote articles about the segregation in the United States. She even refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States, although she was offered $10,000 by a Miami club. Not only this, while working with the Civil Rights Movement, she began adopting children, whom she often referred to as her “rainbow tribe.” Just like this, Josephine Baker tried to bring changes to society. “It’s almost impossible, to sum up such a multi-faceted figure, which is why today’s Doodle is in a slideshow format highlighting several of Baker’s most impactful accomplishments,” Doodle designer Lydia Nichols told Refinery29. “The bold, limited palette and simple aesthetic were influenced by poster art of the 1920s and 30s when Baker broke onto the scene.” [Featured Image by AP Images] Share 3 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Contributor Viraj Mahajan Tags: Josephine Baker, Rihanna to play Josephine Baker?, google doodles, google doodle June 2, 2017 Robyn Dixon Hopes Ashley Darby Will Stay Out Of Relationship After Marital Blowout On ‘RHOP’ June 2, 2017 Kim Zolciak Opens Up About Car Accident Where She Went Through The Windshield Comments LATEST HEADLINES Kourtney Kardashian’s ‘Hideous’ Room Shocks Fans As She Talks Life Without Scott Disick Zac Efron Found Love In A Hopeless Place; A Photoshop Affair ‘The White Princess’ Stuns With Devastating Finale [Episode 8 Recap And Review] [Opinion] Is Ariana Grande Getting Married Soon?

According to a report in BuzzFeed, Waymo's self-driving truck was spotted in a photo and the development was later confirmed by the company. A spokesperson from Waymo -- Google's self-driving car arm -- said that it took "eight years of experience in building self-driving hardware and software and conducting a technical exploration into how our technology can integrate into a truck." Safety was the focus of the expansion into the sector, the spokesperson said, with the aim of reducing "thousands of trucking-related deaths each year". Waymo confirmed that it was only testing one vehicle at the moment and it was still manually driving it on a public road in order to collect data. Its rival Uber has already delivered its first shipment in a self-driving freight vehicle last August -- a short time after it bought trucking startup Otto for $680 million. Waymo and Uber became fierce rivals when the former sued and filed a lawsuit against the latter for allegedly stealing trade secrets and self-driving technology from it. The lawsuit argued that former Waymo manager Anthony Levandowski took information when he left the company and later co-founded Otto in January 2016.

This morning, multiple sources have confirmed this will indeed be Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and here’s what Nexus smartphone and tablets owners need to know. On October 5th Google released Android 6.0 Marshmallow, along with the brand new Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P smartphones. Now nearly two months later the first small maintenance update is here, set to roll out later today and all week long. Read: New Android Emoji Release Confirmed The update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow appears to be a rather small one aimed at delivering a few small changes for tablets, likely some security improvements, performance enhancements, but most of all it’s changing emoji characters. Here’s what we know so far, and we’ll confirm more once the updates start arriving. With the release of iOS 9.1 back in October Apple delivered over 150 new emoji characters for iPhone owners. Allowing users to express themselves with the keyboard in ways never available before. Emoji keyboards are getting increasingly more popular, and Google quickly said they too, would be adding more to Android. Like the popular taco emoji, multiple different fingers and hand gestures, tons of food, additional faces and more. The release of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow appears to mostly be for that, but other changes are includes which is why we’re seeing a version bump to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. What’s New Google will be adding over 200 new emoji to Android with the update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, as a part of Unicode 8. This is a system level software update to the font, which is why Google couldn’t just update the keyboard on the Play Store. Ars Technica confirmed the update is Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, has a list of all 200 new emoji coming soon, as well as a few other small details regarding the software update. Read: Android 6.0 vs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop: What’s New in Marshmallow With Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow all Nexus smartphones and tablets, and eventually other phones and tablets will see some small changes. Nothing huge or noteworthy has been found, but we’ll know more soon. Here’s what we know so far, and we’ll confirm more details when the update arrives. There will be over 200 new emoji characters built into stock Android, and other manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and more will need to update to Android 6.0.1 as well. The navigation bar on Android tablets has been changed. With 6.0.1 the back, home, and multi-taksing buttons which were on the bottom center of the screen, will now be split and to the edges. Meaning users can easily hit back or home at the bottom left of the screen with their thumbs, and the square multi-tasking button will be on the bottom right. Making using tablets easier than before and similar to old Android tablets from a few years ago. There are also additional changes to the Do-Not-disturb controls. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow will also have the latest security patches for the month of December. There could be other changes, battery or performance improvements and more, but we can’t be sure until the update arrives. We could also see fixes for the recent reports of RGB colors being wrong in Marshmallow. Android 6.0.1 Release Date According to Google’s VP of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer and a few posts to Twitter, the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update will start rolling out to new Nexus devices later today, and continue all week long for others. Meaning most users should have it before the end of the week, or early next week at the latest. We don’t know which devices will get it first, but most likely will be the new Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. This will be a small over-the-air software update that will automatically appear. Users can also head into settings > about phone (or tablet) > check for updates, and manually install the software once it’s released for your specific device. What Devices Will Get Android 6.0.1 There hasn’t been any formal announcement yet, but most likely all new Nexus smartphones and tablets that are on Android 6.0 will get the new 6.0.1 update. Those being the Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013), the Nexus 9 and Google’s Nexus Player. Google has yet to officially announce Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with all the changes or release the factory images, but we’re expecting them to be released later today. Once they arrive users can manually update if they’d like, wait for software updates to arrive, and get the latest software right from Google. As for other devices from popular manufacturers, the wait will continue. Most users in the United States with the Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, LG G4, Moto X and more are all still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and now that wait could be even longer. The good news is the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update appears to be rather small, so manufacturers can add the changes and release the update as soon as possible. Most likely all devices that aren’t a Nexus should see updates later this month, in early January, and possibly into February. As soon as Samsung, LG, Motorola and others reveal release dates, we’ll be sure to update with all the details.

According to cyber security firm Check Point, dozens of malicious apps were downloaded between 4.5 million to 18.5 million times from the Play Store. Some of the malware-affected apps have been discovered residing on the online store for several years. "Judy" is one such case of how an open and free mobile operating system (OS) can be exploited by malicious app developers. Most security flaws we hear about now affect old builds of the OS or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security, technology website extremetech.com reported on Friday. The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google's largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $2,00,000. Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who demonstrate an exploit, get a cash prize -- the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android's core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000, the report said.

Not looking good for the lads out West, the Hurricanes converting two tries in the first half, the hosts yet to score. And that’s where we’ll leave this particular fixture for tonight. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.58am EDT 08:58 THAT WAS THE DAY THAT WAS PLAY OF THE DAY The final term of the Giants and Magpies elimination final could probably fit into every category here. The Western Sydney hosts looked set for elimination from the post-season at the first time of asking after trailing by up to six goals in the concluding stanza. After missing out on a double chance by a single goal - also at home - last week, it would have been a galling way for the Giants to end their campaign. But they came from the clouds, scoring seven of the last ten goals of the game to hit the front. When Collingwood popped one in to level the game at 51 apiece with 17 seconds to go, they still needed a huge play. A turnover, meanwhile, could be fatal. Enter Susan Pettitt. From the restart, she received the pass and threw long to the goal mouth where towering shooter Kristina Brice took a strong catch, turned, and sealed the win. Check it out. Clutch. It earned a spot in next weekend’s Preliminary Final against the Melbourne Vixens, who were upset by the Sunshine Coast in the major semi-final earlier in the afternoon. TODAY’S BIG WINNER When GWS started their AFL journey it was largely with noses turned up from the traditional football centres. They were manufactured. Plastic. In a city that doesn’t care about the code. You get the picture. It wasn’t nice. Well, today, in their sixth season, they have topped the ladder for the first time. Cop that. A glut of early injuries made going slow to begin the season, threatening to stop their premiership tilt before it started. But their classy win against the Essendon today capped a wonderful month of footy where they have made a habit of winning the close one. Here, they showed they had another club in the bag too: putting away the opposition. While Essendon were gallant, bringing the margin to single digits in the last term at one stage, GWS held their nerve and ran out the game despite a six day break and returning from Perth last weekend. That’s what real contenders do: find a way to win and win well even when it’s hard. And kick the ball beautifully. They do that too. TODAY’S BIG LOSER Sneaking ahead before half time, the Gold Coast Titans were well placed to push hard for an away win in Townsville against the Cowboys. After, they didn’t get a sniff. Indeed, from leading the game at the break they didn’t score again, to be thrashed 20-8. What a mess. COMEBACK OF THE DAY It was only a two point deficit at the break that Richmond had to overcome against North, but it was a lot more than that too. North had won seven of the last right at the Tigers, the previous time by 70 points. The Kangaroos have been in very good nick over the last five weeks, too. Not to mention Richmond’s nagging habit - last Saturday aside - of finding ways to lose the unlosable. The primary issue there: letting it become close to begin with in games they otherwise dominated. Not tonight. Piling on six goals in the third term, then kicking away in the final quarter, Richmond go to bed in the top four. They deserve to sleep well and enjoy the week off. Richmond haven’t won a final since 2001, but it is performances like tonight that can give their loyal faithful belief that this is the year they break that hoodoo. At a minimum. Then? Who knows. IF TODAY WERE A SONG Speaking of Richmond. The man they call Dusty was best on ground. Again. He firms as Brownlow favourite. He’s also a person of interest to, reportedly, multiple clubs at the end of this season. To the extent that North Melbourne supporters were seen with banners urging the superstar to join them. After play when asked about his growing currency on the open market, Martin joked that it was a good result. I stress to Tiger readers: he was having a laugh. But still, Undercover Mart(i)n, based on that exchange alone, works if you ask me. Enjoy. Go with it.

The Proteas were cruising, but a couple of quick wickets - including ABdV for four. They are currently 213-3 in the 38th. Still on track for 320+, which is only par in the 50-over game these days. Keep following it on the mighty OBO with Nick Miller now, and the doyen Rob Smyth later. TENNIS: Live action from Roland-Garros as well, with Andy Murray in action today. Indeed, he’s a set and a break up at the moment. Follow it game-by-game. Updated at 8.34am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.26am EDT 08:26 AFL: More from the Docklands, where the Tigers ended up doing it easy over North, taking the win by 35 points to bounce into fourth place on the ladder at the half way mark of the season. Via AAP. A Dustin Martin masterclass has propelled Richmond to a 35-point win over North Melbourne at Etihad Stadium. The Tigers superstar was brilliant throughout but elevated his game even higher in a blistering six-goals-to-one third-quarter that set up the 14.17 (101) to 9.12 (66) win on Saturday night. If Martin is the target of a North Melbourne free agency poaching raid, as has been widely reported, the Kangaroos will need to up their offer on the evidence of his 38-possession, two-goal game. North couldn’t combat the bullocking midfielder’s trademark strength, but Martin also wowed the 36,100-strong crowd with breathtaking disposal by foot. As good as the Tigers were in the pivotal third term, the Roos were equally bad. Brad Scott’s side imploded with three 50m penalties and a free kick gifting Richmond scores as they turned a two-point half-time deficit into a decisive 28-point lead at three-quarter time.

Well, nearly. In Perth, the final game of the evening is underway as the Western Storm host the Hurricanes I’ll keep an eye on it as we wrap up the day. The Force are third in the Australian conference and will be encouraged by the Waratah’s loss earlier today; they can join them on points by winning this evening. The Hurricanes are second in the NZ conference and bound for the post-season. Both teams won their previous encounter, but the ‘Canes have a 9-1 record against the Force in their last ten starts. Indeed, they have won 12 on the spin against non-Kiwi opposition. The Force will be determined to show something for their home fans, though. Last time in Perth they were thrashed by 49 points when up against the Highlanders, their worst home loss. Ever.

Very impressive second half, from a two point deficit to a 35 point win for the Richmond Footy Club. Been a while since they had beaten the Kangaroos, but picked a good time for it. Dustin Martin, who North are trying to buy as well, spoke after the game. He said it was the quickest game he had played all year. Then joked that his Best On Ground performance wasn’t a bad outcome given clubs are after him. Brilliant subplot to season 2017, that one. But the main game is whether Richmond can not only make the final four, but win a final. Or a couple. Or a few. It’s been a while. But they were fast and furious when it mattered. Scarily so.

Dan Butler kicks truly from a 48m set shot directly in front, extending the lead to 34 points. Are they contenders? It feels odd to say that. But turning at 7-4, kicking 100+ points tonight, coming back form a half-time deficit... all good signs. Especially from a side who have struggled to put games away. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am EDT 07:53 NRL: And the Cowboys impressive comeback over the Titans in Townsville. Maroons utility Michael Morgan helped put the disappointment of a State of Origin opening loss behind him by guiding North Queensland to a much-needed 20-8 home NRL win on Saturday night over Gold Coast. With Cowboys captain Johnathan Thurston still sidelined, Townsville junior Morgan played arguably his best game of the season, the halfback bagging a try and impressing with his kicking game all night. Opposing Origin star Jarryd Hayne had a largely forgettable night, the Blues’ centre barely noticeable in a Titans side needing some attacking spark. Outside of a 10-minute period up to halftime, the Titans struggled and were outscored 14-0 in the final term to slip to another listless loss. North Queensland looked promising in attack and enjoyed 65 per cent of possession in the opening 20 minutes but couldn’t finish a number of half chances against resolute Gold Coast defence. After a mountain of pressure and possession, the Cowboys were finally rewarded when Morgan powered over for a signature running try. Winger Kyle Feldt missed an easy conversion attempt but, soon after, a penalty goal took North Queensland to 6-0 nearing halftime. The Titans were then quick to pounce on a Cowboys error, as Dale Copley combined with Ash Taylor to send the Titans’ halfback over for an impressive 50-metre try. While a stellar Lachlan Coote tackle stopped a certain Gold Coast try, a ruck penalty allowed Taylor to boot the Titans to an unlikely 8-6 halftime lead. North Queensland started the second period with great attacking intent and were soon rewarded when standout rookie Coen Hess stormed over for his ninth try of the year to recapture the lead for the Cowboys. Feldt added another penalty goal to extend the Cowboys’ lead to six and he added four more points shortly after with a smart finish from an inch-perfect Morgan cut-out pass. The Cowboys went out further to 20-8 lead after the Titans gifted Feldt a penalty shot from in front when they failed to get a line dropout away in time.

The Brumbies have clinched Super Rugby’s Australian conference with a 32-3 bonus-point thrashing of the hapless Melbourne Rebels in Canberra. Saturday night’s four-tries-to-one victory means the Brumbies head into the June international break assured of playing finals for the fifth year running. Heavy dew made things difficult for players on Saturday night with both sides making handling errors throughout the match. Despite the slippery conditions, the Brumbies had no problem illustrating the gulf in class between Australia’s best and worst performed franchises this season in front of a 8,970 supporters at GIO Stadium. The Brumbies controlled a scrappy first half and went to the break leading 11-3. Winger Henry Speight took a quick tap from a penalty on the half hour mark and drew a slew of defenders as he attempted to dive over under the posts. Two phases later Kyle Godwin found Jordan Smiler out wide, with the No. 8 breaking a 25-game try drought and scoring the only five-pointer of the first half. The home side made a dream start to the second period with outside centre Tevita Kurindrani bullocking his way through the Rebels’ defence to score under the posts, and Wharenui Hawera added the points to extend the lead to 15. A brilliant run from flanker Chris Alcock just before the hour mark gave halfback Joe Powell the chance to set up Hawera who crossed under the posts before converting his own try to take the Brumbies to a 25-3 lead. A dashing break from winger Marika Koroibete late in the second half produced the Rebels best chance for a try, but he was denied by Tom Banks and Kyle Godwin metres from the line. Nigel Ah Wong dived on a loose ball to score the final try of the game in the dying minutes to cap a dominant Brumbies performance. Hawera notched both his penalty goal attempts while Reece Hodge scored the Rebels’ only points of the match with a long-range penalty goal mid way through the first half.

The report from a ridiculous first-semi final in Western Sydney, the Giants getting over the line inside the final 12 seconds. Giants Netball have produced an extraordinary final assault to overcome Collingwood Magpies 52-51 in a Super Netball minor semi-final nailbiter on Saturday night. The Giants looked set for a season-ending loss when they trailed the Magpies by six goals with seven minutes remaining at the Sydney Olympic Park Sports Centre. However, the team that have battled without injured captain Kim Green since round five staged a courageous rally to score seven of the last 10 goals of the game. The decisive moment came with 17 seconds remaining and the scores locked at 51-51, when veteran Susan Pettitt threw a long pass into the circle where goal shooter Kristina Brice gained the ball and held her nerve to sink the winner.

I reckon he’s still not to win the Bertochi Ham for goal of the week. North needed one of those to drop in order to have a realistic chance. But they do have the run of play since the final break. Oh dear: salt in the wounds here, a snap from big man Mason Wood from relatively close range popped out on the full. Brad Scott is laughing.

With this win, the Canberrans stitch up top spot in the Australian conference. A big post-season awaits. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.22am EDT 07:22 AFL: Q3 1:00 remaining. North 8.8 (56) Richmond 12.13 (85). “Guess who?” says BT on the call. Dustin Martin, of course. It’s a straightforward snap from close range after some clever hands close in. “He has to be firming for outright Brownlow favourite,” adds Luke Darcy. Sounds about right. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.20am EDT 07:20 NRL: Full-time at Townsville, where North Queensland had comfortably held off the the Gold Coast 20-8 in the end courtesy of a 14-0 second half. Messy for the Titans. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.19am EDT 07:19 AFL: Q3 3:00 remaining. North 8.7 (55) Richmond 11.13 (79). At last! Brilliant finish from Atlee, but they made hard work of that. Got out the back and they needed that desperately, North. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.04am EDT 07:04 AFL: Q3 16:38 remaining. North 7.6 (48) Richmond 10.10 (70). Out of the blocks with four quicks goals to start the second half. On fire. Tiger Time. With the netball over, my attention will return to the Docklands to see this one through I think. SUPER RUGBY: 56 minutes. Brumbies 18 - Rebels 3. A try in the minutes after the restart for the Brumbies to take control of this game. Built on the back of a solid scrum, Tevita Kuridrani over the line and Wharenui Hawera converts. Has a familiar, sinking feeling about it now for the battling Melbourne side. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.57am EDT 06:57 NRL: The Cowboys have turned around the earlier deficit to open up a commanding 10 point lead with 20 minutes to go at Townsville, ahead of the Titans 18-8.

Who knew it was going to be the talking point of 2017? Anyway, Tomahawk’s in strife. And knows it, based on this AAP report from ABC earlier today. Tom Hawkins can’t believe he jumper punched Adelaide’s Matt Crouch after the well-publicised AFL crack down, but the Geelong star remains hopeful he will escape suspension. Hawkins admitted his angst over the second-quarter incident sat in the pit of his stomach after the Cats’ 22-point win over the Crows at Simonds Stadium. The 28-year-old remonstrated with Matt and Brad Crouch after Geelong skipper Joel Selwood was taken to ground in a heavy tackle. Hawkins’ 200-game milestone appears set to be marred by an AFL ban after he made contact with Crouch’s jaw - an observation he disputes. “It was a bit of a funny one ... on a night when there was a bit of push and shove I felt like I got him in the chest,” Hawkins said on ABC Radio. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.36am EDT 06:36 AFL: Half time also in the footy, North taking a two point advantage (48-46) to the long break over Richmond. I might flick over to that for the third quarter. Twitter suggests a tasty contest. Andrew Wu (@wutube) Richo: "There's not much in this game, you look across stat sheet..." Ch 7 show time in forward 1/2 stat: R 70%, NM 30% #AFLNorthTigers June 3, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.34am EDT 06:34 SUPER RUGBY. Half time. Brumbies 11 - Rebels 3. The try eventually came for the hosts in the 31st minute after getting the ball deep into Rebel territory but electing to tap rather than kick. Out to the left they went, Jordan Smller the try scorer. They did miss the chance to press home the advantage with a conversion. To the break with an eight point lead. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.24am EDT 06:24 NETBALL: All happening at Western Sydney! Collingwood, the visitors, are leading GWS 33-32 in the third term. All to play for, the lower eliminated. AFL: Looks like a cracking game in Melbourne, but Richmond not kicking straight. 5.9 to North’s 5.4 about half way through the second term at Docklands. NRL: The Titans go to the half-time interval ahead of the Cowboys 8-6. They went ahead through a late penalty goal. CRICKET: South Africa are 28-0 after nine overs at The Oval. Good start, by the looks, by Sri Lanka’s bowlers. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.14am EDT 06:14 SUPER RUGBY: 27 minutes. Brumbies 6 - Rebels 3. Rebels on the board with a penalty goal via Hodge. Drained the kick from 50m. Nicely hit. But minutes later, the Rebels penalised for offside. Hawera gets it done. Two penalty goals to one. I’ll swing around the other venues and get back to the ruggers before half-time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.09am EDT 06:09 SUPER RUGBY: 17 minutes. Brumbies 3 - Rebels 0. It is top versus bottom of Australia conference, nine points clear for ACT at top of the table, where this game is being played. The Rebels can take some hope though - the only game they have won for the year was against the Brumbies, back in round eight. Could the bottom ranked side do the double over the top? Strange times. ACT are coming off wins in South Africa and Argentina, further establishing their credentials as the team to beat from our part of the world. Statistically, there is no better tackling team going round. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.55am EDT 05:55 NRL: Early try at Townsville. NRL (@NRL) The @nthqldcowboys finally crack the @GCTitans defence!#NRLCowboysTitans #NRL pic.twitter.com/D5zW81TQkU June 3, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.46am EDT 05:46 NETBALL: Q2, 11 minutes remaining. Giants 17 - Magpies 13. After the Lightning’s upset earlier in the second semi-final (don’t make me say major and minor, I can’t do it, Page & McIntyre won’t allow it) the winner of the Giants and Pies will take on the Vixens next week in the Prelim. The Giants blew their double chance opportunity last week, losing by a single goal at home to the Lightning. They are tonight’s host. However, home ground advantage means little between these two. In round three the Giants won on the road, then in round nine the Pies did the same. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.41am EDT 05:41 AFL: We’re already ten minutes into the North v Tigers match at Docklands, North leading 8-2. The Kangas come into the clash 13th on the ladder, while Richmond consolidated their top eight last week, currently sixth. Last time they met was round 11 last year when North thrashed the Yellow and Black 70 in Tasmania. It’s the pattern of recent history between the teams, North winning seven of the last eight. But overcoming Essendon in a classic Dreamtime match last week, Richmond snapped their dismal streak of close losses. North are in decent nick too, winning four of their last five starts after stinking it up early on. Want a stat? Richmond only concede 81 points a game and North scoring 96. Fairly obvious, then, this where this will be won and lost. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.36am EDT 05:36 NRL: Here’s the AAP report of the thriller at the SFS, the Roosters holding off the Broncos for an 18-16 triumph. “Two tries from Boyd Cordner have inspired the Sydney Roosters to a thrilling 18-16 win over Brisbane which moves them into the NRL top four. Broncos goalkicker Jordan Kahu had a chance to send the game into golden point on Saturday night when Tautau Moga crossed with three minutes remaining. But his sideline conversion hooked wide, and the Roosters survived a last-ditch scare to leapfrog the Broncos into equal-second spot with St George Illawarra and Cronulla. Cordner, one of nine players backing up from Wednesday’s State of Origin opener, broke a 6-6 deadlock minutes before halftime with a trademark try on the edge of the ruck. And that appeared to be the final try of the match before the game ignited with three late tries in the last 10 minutes to set up a thrilling finish for the hearty crowd of 12,232.” (Only 12,232? Hmmm) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.33am EDT 05:33 Let’s keep whipping around. Sri Lanka have won the toss and will bat against South Africa at The Oval in the first pool game of Group B in the Champs Trophy. Pick up the OBO with Nick Miller. At the French Open Andy Murray is up today. We have rolling coverage from Paris in the game-by-game (I think it is called) over here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.31am EDT 05:31 NRL: The Roosters got over the line against the Broncos, but it was a close run thing. Sydney consolidated their top four standing with an 18-16 victory. More on that as it comes to hand. Next up in a few minutes in that competition, Cowboys v Titans. They are coming into this game at Willows Sports Complex in Townsville 7th and 12th respectively. Both sides are coming off the both and both are hard to get a read on for their inconsistency through 2017 so far. When they last played round four, Gold Coast took the points at home over injury-depleted Cowboys. They will again tonight be missing Johnathan Thurston. The Titans are also struggling with ongoing injury, but get Jarryd Hayne back for this clash. Handy inclusion. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.21am EDT 05:21 AFL: Full Time. Giants 18.9 (117) v Dons 15.11 (101). The Giants have done it, moving to the top of the ladder for the first time in their six season history. For the most part, Essendon stayed with league leaders. The visitors can take plenty of that, but not the four points. A lot expected from GWS after reaching the final four last year. With one more game before their bye (Carlton in Melbourne), they should be able to consolidate their position heading into the back half of the season. A lot to like. Josh Kelly was best afield, collecting 38 touches and 12 score involvements. Toby Greene was also fantastic, finishing with three goals for the winners. SING THE SONG. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.17am EDT 05:17 AFL: Q4 1:00 remaining. Giants 18.9 (117) v Dons 15.11 (101). Cameron hits the post from 40! Could have just about ran all the way in, he had a paddock. Greene has another chance, a set shot in an almost identical place on the field to where he missed earlier in the quarter. And he misses again. But it doesn’t go the distance, so the scrap continues, the ball ultimately ending up back in the GWS 50 after taking some time of the clock. Eventually Kennedy gets under a high bomb and he kicks the winner from close range. Bellchambers responds with one himself down the other end, but it’s all over now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.06am EDT 05:06 AFL: Q4 9:00 remaining. Giants 17.8 (110) v Dons 14.11 (95). They’re a classy outfit, the GWS. Moments like this that the really good teams, the true contenders, find a way through. After the short break and the travel. In spite of the injuries and the most start. Irrespective of the baggage from last year and the expectations on their shoulders to go two better in 2017. That was all embodied in this clinical response to two Essendon goals in a minute to make it a single-digit game. Immediately from the restart the switch was flicked with bodies flung at the ball. Quick hands from Scully got the ball out, composure from Williams shown to take an extra second before having his shot. He made no mistake. Quality. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.03am EDT 05:03 AFL: Q4 9:00 remaining. Giants 16.8 (104) v Dons 14.11 (95). McDonald-Tipungwuti! Daniher takes his second strong mark at centre half forward in the space of a couple of minutes. He takes a shot but mishits it and the forward takes his second mark close to goal in the space of a minute. Taken on his chest in the end, poor defending from GWS. But he is, as Brown says on the call, rewarded for playing in front. Nine point margin, nine minutes left. Game on. Do the the hosts have the legs after their cross-continental journey? We’ll find out soon. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.01am EDT 05:01 AFL: Q4 12:30 remaining. Giants 16.8 (104) v Dons 13.11 (89). They won’t go away! Just when it looked like GWS were going to waltz away with this one, Essendon have a penetrative few minutes with a handful of inside 50s. At last, one goes to hand with McDonald-Tipungwuti taking a strong grab and converting from 20. Maybe? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.58am EDT 04:58 AFL: Q4 12:30 remaining. Giants 16.8 (104) v Dons 12.11 (83). James Stewart is gifted a set shot for a notional infringement in the contest. Had that been the application of the rule a generation ago Jason Dunstall would have kicked 1500. Anyway, he misses. I’m pleased. Essendon lament. That may have been their window. Down the other end again in a flash from the kick-off, Toby Greene is found on the chest inside 50. They’ve kicked so well tonight. But not so Greene here who misses out on what would have been his fourth. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.55am EDT 04:55 AFL: Q4 17:30 remaining. Giants 16.7 (103) v Dons 12.10 (82). GWS with everything to play for here, a chance to go top of the ladder for the first time in their history if they can get the points. They’ll lead the comp going into the half-way mark as well. Cameron has another chance to extend the lead, a set shot from where the 50 meets the boundary line, but can’t thread it through, missing - just - to the near side. The spearhead is now equal leader in the Coleman after his goal moments earlier. Kelly misses another shot, albeit a chancier swing from outside the 50. Still: they’re once again peppering. One more should do it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.52am EDT 04:52 AFL: Q4 17:30 remaining. Giants 16.5 (101) v Dons 11.10 (82). Plenty of noise from the travelling Essendon fans, the Bombers chant audible around the ground. Giants have been good in close games with a string of single-digit victories, including an eight point triumph over the Eagles in Perth last week. But how much will that hurt now? (Nearly) the longest trip in footy, and all that, on a six day break. Oh, but Jeremy Cameron is having none of that! The star forward latches onto the contested ball in the pocket, composes himself and snaps truly. An old-fashioned steadier, right there. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.48am EDT 04:48 AFL: Q4 18:30 remaining. Giants 15.5 (95) v Dons 11.10 (82). Two in a minute for Essendon and they have got it back to 13 points! Josh Green has got the first. Merrett put the ball into the 50 and the small-who-plays-tall snaked it through. The second came through a succession of handballs and a clever Colyer snap after a turnover in the pocket. “I think they are a big chance,” says Jonathan Brown on the telly.

(File photo) After facing criticism on the placement of "annoying" ads on websites, Google is now going ahead with its ad-blocking plans and will add a feature to its Chrome browser that will block advertisements which do not meet company standards, a media report said. Google has confirmed that it intends to add a new feature to its Chrome web browser that will block certain types of ads from being seen by users and in some cases could block all the ads on websites that do not meet certain standards, Fortune reported. The company said that it wants to work with publishers to help them understand what kinds of ads will no longer be acceptable. The Tech And Auto Show On CNN-News18 | SAT 7:30PM And SUN 1:30PM Chrome will now include ad-blocking features that are turned on by default. Ads that meet certain annoying criteria will not be shown and if a website crosses a certain threshold of substandard ads, users won't see any ads, the report said. Some of the ad types that will be blocked include pop-ups, videos that auto-play, and so-called "pre-stitial" ads that force readers to sit through a countdown before they can see the page's contents. Since many leading publishers rely on some or all of these strategies to boost ad revenue, Google will allow them to show users a note when their ads are blocked by third-party software. The note will give readers the option of either disabling their blocker or buying an ad-free pass or subscription of some kind for that site, the report noted.

The Hollywood Reporter Movies TV Business Style Politics Tech Culture Awards Video Subscribe Newsletters Exec Suite June 02, 2017 11:26am PT by Eriq Gardner Viacom, Google on Same Copyright Page in Appellate Fight Over Music Licensing @VH1Classic/Twitter The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hears arguments whether the Justice Department is right to bar BMI from issuing fractional licenses. The U.S. Justice Department's decision last year to require "full-works licensing" by public performance outlets ASCAP and BMI may have the music industry warning that certain groups of songwriters might no longer be able to collaborate with each other, but it's managed to unite two old copyright foes, Viacom and Google. ASCAP and BMI are currently litigating the DOJ's new position that 100 percent licensing of song compositions is required under consent decrees made in the 1940s to settle an antitrust investigation. The prospect how this might interfere with relationships in music — where multiple authors often work together on joint works before assigning co-ownership shares to different entities — has landed in court in more ways than one. Last September, U.S. District Court Judge Louis Stanton handed BMI a victory by rejecting the DOJ's position that consent decrees don't bar the issuance of fractional licenses. History will show that Stanton is the same judge that presided over the long war between Viacom and Google over what was uploaded to YouTube during the video site's early days. That case eventually settled. Now, both Viacom and Google have signed on to the same amicus brief challenging Stanton's music licensing decision at the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. They are not alone. The amicus brief also features Netflix, Spotify and, among others, the American Beverage Licensees — the place to go for both Bacardi and Mast-Jaegermeister.  The group tells the 2nd Circuit that it needn't be concerned with the possibility of song co-owners breaching contracts among themselves by licensing a work without the other co-owners' consent. What's important, they say, is "the nature of a joint work, the plain language of the decree, and the consequences of disrupting the decree’s careful balancing of pro- and anti-competitive effects." As for specific concerns, the audiovisual content providers — Netflix, Viacom, etc. — express worry about being put into a disadvantageous position when video works with incorporated music land in their hands. "If BMI engaged in fractional licensing, co-owners of split works could continue to withhold performance rights at the outset and effectively deprive the downstream exhibitor of license coverage for already-produced content unless the exhibitor took licenses at whatever fee the rights holder might charge. The exhibitor would be forced to engage with the rights holders at a time when it has no option but to use the music already in the can. The major publishers recognize the inordinate market power this timing issue gives them." Google has similar anxiety because it runs a digital music service and doesn't like the idea of multiple, overcomplicated negotiations. The brief talks about the prospect of rights holders potentially using hold-up opportunities and withdrawing from BMI and ASCAP and forming new PROs. "This problem is exacerbated for the radio and digital music industries because record labels typically release sound recordings for airplay weeks or months before the ownership of the compositions embodied in those recordings is made known (or even determined)," states the brief. "Moreover, there are often extended disputes about who controls the rights to compositions. For example, the hit 'Uptown Funk' originally had six credited songwriters before a dispute resulted in 10 getting credit." Here's the full amicus brief. There's 10 lawyers here, and while we don't know who deserves credit for the authorship, it's signed by Kenneth Steinthal at King & Spalding.

We’re not in the business of punishing people for getting on,” he said. “On the contrary, we want people to keep more of their earnings. The only way they can be sure their taxes won’t rise is to vote Conservative.” But during a campaign presser in West Yorkshire this morning, May refused to echo Fallon’s claims. “Our plans on tax have been set up in the manifesto, we are a party that believe in low taxes … when people come to vote they know they have a choice between a party that has always believed in lower taxes and a Labour party whose manifesto we know will cost ordinary working people,” she said. In response, Corbyn has said the Tories are in “chaos” over their tax plans. “One minister says they’re going to give no more tax rises, indeed possibly tax reductions, for the very wealthiest; then they can’t answer the question about tax rises for the rest of the population; then they can’t answer the questions about funding social care”. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Fallon’s comments showed the Tories were the party for “the few, not the many”, and the Lib Dem former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said they indicated that the Tories would raise national insurance instead. During the same campaign stop in Lincoln on Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn promised to protect Britain from global threats after facing criticism for refusing to say whether he would launch a retaliatory nuclear strike. The Labour leader suggested he would sign off on more ships for the Navy and extra surveillance aircraft for the RAF alongside pledges to boost funding and numbers in the police and armed services. “We will protect the people of this country from any threat that they face anywhere in the world,” he said. Meanwhile, Iain Duncan Smith was on the Today programme to defend May’s refusal to debate with Corbyn, maintaining that debates didn’t change opinion. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband refuted this, stating: “I think that debates and opportunities to speak to the public do have an effect, particularly for leaders of the opposition.” Miliband also said Corbyn’s was a “more radical” manifesto but that “it’s a manifesto I’m proud to be associated with”. While Nicola Sturgeon told voters they have a “golden opportunity” to end austerity across the UK, Ruth Davidson said the election was the last chance to avoid a second independence referendum. “Thursday’s election is the last chance we’ll have to stop Nicola Sturgeon in her tracks,” she said.

Read more Updated at 9.49am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.21am EDT 09:21 Labour and Lib Dems attack Tory tax 'chaos' Jeremy Corbyn has claimed the Conservatives’ tax plans are in “chaos” after Theresa May failed to back a senior minister who said higher earners will not face an income tax hike under a new Tory government. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said voting Conservative in the General Election on Thursday was “the only way” people could be sure income tax would not go up. His comments went further than the party’s manifesto, which said they would keep taxes “low” but did not rule out a rise in income tax. Campaigning in West Yorkshire, the prime minister declined to be drawn on his comments, saying only it was their “firm intention” to reduce taxes for ordinary families. She said: “Our position on tax hasn’t changed. We have set it out in the manifesto. It is our firm intention to reduce taxes for ordinary working families.” Her comments were seized on by Corbyn, who said the Conservative leadership was in disarray. “I think there’s complete chaos going on at the top of the Government,” he said during a campaign visit to Lincoln. “One minister says they’re going to give no more tax rises, indeed possibly tax reductions for the very wealthiest, then they can’t answer the question about tax rises for the rest of the population, then they can’t answer the questions about funding social care.” For the Liberal Democrats, former business minister Jo Swinson said: “The Conservatives are in utter mayhem over their tax policy.” The Conservative manifesto said there would be no increase in VAT but dropped David Cameron’s pledge not to raise income tax or national insurance contributions after Chancellor Philip Hammond complained that it limited his room for manoeuvre. However, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Fallon made it clear that income tax “absolutely” would not rise under a re-elected Tory government. Asked if high earners could confidently vote Conservative next week, safe in the knowledge that their income tax would not go up, Sir Michael said: “Yes. “You’ve seen our record. We’re not in the business of punishing people for getting on, on the contrary we want people to keep more of their earnings. The only way they can be sure their taxes won’t rise is to vote Conservative. We already know your tax will go up if you vote Labour on Thursday.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.17am EDT 09:17 More from Scotland now, where Ruth Davidson is seeing the election less as a “golden opportunity” (13:42) and instead as the last chance to avoid a second independence referendum. “Thursday’s election is the last chance we’ll have to stop Nicola Sturgeon in her tracks,” The Scottish Conservative leader said. “It’s our last opportunity to have our say, make Nicola Sturgeon listen for once - and stop her second referendum. “Come Friday morning, once we’ve cast our vote, we all know what she will try to do. She’ll try to use the result to push her demand for that second referendum.” She urged all voters to back the Scottish Conservatives to stop the SNP. The party leader said: “I’m not asking you to agree with me on everything. I just want us to come together on this one big thing - to stop the SNP in their tracks. “This election isn’t about deciding whether you’re Tory, or Labour, or Lib Dem. It’s about sending Nicola Sturgeon a message. And by voting for me and my team, we can do just that. “So - Thursday is the last chance we’ll have to shout out loud and clear what we think of Nicola Sturgeon’s plans. Only a vote for the Scottish Conservatives will make her listen.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.05am EDT 09:05 Corbyn challenged on nuclear deterrent, again At a campaign stop in Lincoln on Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn promised to protect Britain from global threats after facing criticism for refusing to say whether he would launch a retaliatory nuclear strike.

He has repeatedly been asked throughout the campaign about whether he would “push the button”.

Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA Labour officially backs the renewal of Britian’s nuclear deterrent, but Corbyn has spoken against the move in the past. After hosting a roundtable with pensioners in Lincoln, Corbyn was asked if he would keep the British people safe as prime minister. The Labour leader replied: “We will protect the people of this country from any threat that they face anywhere in the world. He went on: We will invest properly in our police service, we will invest properly in our armed services, the numbers in the armed services have gone down, the Navy are crying out for more ships, the Air Force are crying out for more surveillance aircraft. We would fund them properly to achieve all of that. We would also face up to the terrible danger of cyber attacks against our society, look what happened to the NHS only two weeks ago, and we will deal with the issue of the terrorist threat which is obviously appalling. What happened in Manchester was dreadful beyond belief, the way you deal with that is putting more police on the streets - we will put 10,000 more police on the streets, the Conservatives are taking 20,000 off the streets. We will fund the security services to monitor people and protect them, but also our strategy is to bring communities together.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.42am EDT 08:42 Sturgeon urges end to austerity Nicola Sturgeon, who spent much of the morning in a helicopter (see 10:56), has been telling voters they have a “golden opportunity” to end austerity across the UK. The Scottish first minister said the poll on June 8 will give people the chance to say “enough is enough” and urged them to back her party, saying “now more than ever it is vital that we have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland”. She said: The Tories’ austerity agenda has failed on every count - not only has it choked off the economic recovery but the years of underinvestment have put huge pressure on public services across the UK. We simply can’t go on with more of the same but that is exactly what the Tories are planning to do - and this snap election has presented a golden opportunity for voters across Scotland to say enough is enough. With polls tightening across the UK, the votes of people across Scotland could determine the size of Theresa May’s majority in the next parliament.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.28am EDT 08:28 Nigel Farage has said he felt “a degree of vindication” after hearing that prosecutors had brought charges against Craig Mackinlay, the Conservative candidate who defeated him in South Thanet in 2015. The former Ukip leader told the Press Association: I was very upset two years ago at the circumstances and what took place in that seat. I never complained, I never said anything in public about it but I did feel, with the Crown Prosecution yesterday deciding to prosecute three people, a degree of vindication. Yesterday it emerged Mackinlay will face court after the election over allegations relating to election spending in his battle with Farage, but insists he is confident he will be cleared and will continue to campaign for re-election as the Kent constituency’s MP. After the charges against him and two Tory officials were announced, he received the backing of Theresa May, who said: “The Conservative Party continues to believe that these allegations are unfounded. Craig Mackinlay is innocent until proven guilty and he remains our candidate.” But Farage claimed the charges reflected “badly” on the PM and said if he was running the party he would have told Mackinlay that he could not stand but would bring him back if he was found innocent.

While Google has long offered a way to block pop-ups in Chrome, it’s never been a feature that's been very easy to find. To turn it on you’ll need to dig deep into the settings, and most people who use the browser probably don’t even know it’s there. But now Google is finally getting serious about annoying ads. And that includes their own. In a blog post, Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice president of ads and commerce, outlined the company’s new strategy for dealing with ads as part of an effort to build “a better web for everyone.” He explains that Google has joined the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that also includes Facebook, News Corp, and Unilever, to “provide clear, public, data-driven guidance for how the industry can improve ads for consumers.” And that starts with the way Chrome displays ads. As Ramaswamy explains, “In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” It’s unclear whether the new ad blocker would be an option that user could disable or a feature built into the Blink rendering engine that powers the browser. A separate report in The Wall Street Journal states that Google will give publishers “at least six months” to prepare for the change. In addition to filtering out rogue ads that degrade the experience, the publication says the setting will “prevent all ads from appearing on websites that are deemed to provide a bad advertising experience for users.” According to the Journal, Google is pitching the feature as more of a filter than a blocker, much like the pop-up window blocker that already exists in the browser. However, while users need to explicitly opt into that feature, the new ad blocker would be turned on by default for all users. The story behind the story: It’s no secret that Google is one of the richest companies in the world, and the majority of its revenue comes from ads. But while it might seem anti-competitive and a little shady for the biggest ad supplier in the world to be adding an ad blocker to its own browser, this could have good implications all around. Chrome users know that there are several ad-blocking extensions available in the Chrome web store, but most of them take an all-or-nothing approach, which obviously affects Google’s bottom line. By weeding out troublesome and burdensome ads, including those from the Google-run Ad Exchange, it could create a better experience for all, regardless of whether you already run an ad blocker. And it’s not just Chrome that could benefit from this push. As a member of the Coalition for Better Ads, Google is committing to improving the delivery and presentation of ads, something we can all agree is sorely needed.          LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo Homs: Army Forces Claim More Territory in Syria's Desert Iraqi Volunteer Forces Capture Ba'aj West of Mosul from ISIL Iraqis Leave Zanjili Neighborhood as Security Forces Continue Fighting ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Pounding ISIL with Rockets in Syrian Border Region Syria: Army Soldiers Recapture Maskana's Water Pumping Station in Eastern Aleppo 7 Dead, 48 Injured in London Attacks Damascus: Inside Syrian Army's Tank Factory US-Backed Militants Take Control of Syria's 3rd largest Dam as Kurds Allow ISIL to Withdraw from Raqqa Syrian Soldiers Expel ISIL from Aleppo; Maskana Freed Envoy: Iran to Continue Supporting Syria in Anti-Terror Fight Iran Condemns Terrorist Attack in UK Iran Warns Against Terrorist Plots to Undermine Security in Region Iran: Paris Deal Withdrawal Shows US Irresponsibility Towards Int'l Community Dara'a: Syrian Army Kills Tens of Al-Nusra Terrorists, 3 Commanders Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army managed to capture 22 villages and farms near Maskana and eventually forced the ISIL terrorists to retreat from its last stronghold in Aleppo province, the town of Maskana, towards Raqqa province.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time.

I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google's version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don't go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It'll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome.Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don't get rid of annoying types of ads. But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser's efforts. It's a "small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences," Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. "I'm sure there are some publishers who will get hurt," said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won't let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It'll take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers' concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won't place its ads on web pages with objectionable content - porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it's trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with "little substantive content" and "disruptive, shocking or malicious ads."

A lot of Google’s revenue comes from its online advertisements, but that business is being threatened by the rise in usage of ad blockers. Blockers come in the form of extensions so you don’t even have to install new software, just add the mod to your browser. Major ad publishers have realised that a major reason for the popularity of these ad blockers is because of how annoying some of the, can be. From the autoplaying videos, to the gigantic banners that block have the webpage, there’s nothing more annoying than an ad trying to aggressively force you to view its content before you get to what you want.  Google understands this and, in 2016, it joined with the likes of Facebook, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post and major advertising groups to form a union called the Coalition for Better Ads. The idea was to find a balance between ads that make money and don’t annoy the viewer. Now, Google has revealed just what it plans to do to help enforce this standard of advertising. "We plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads standards starting in early 2018,” Google’s senior VP of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a blog post. It’s a bold step for Google to take, considering it has one of the biggest ad distribution platforms online. However, the move does show that even Google is worried about how far online ads may go, given the current trend. Ads liable to be blocked include those that autoplay videos with sound, pop-ups, ones that cover the web content until a timer counts down, and large ads that cover the page even when you scroll. On mobile devices, the list also includes ads that cover more than 30 percent of the screen as well as ones that flash.

Here's how Google disables Burger King's ad after it hijacked Google Assistant Is Google's eagerness to answer questions promoting more falsehood online? After facing criticism on the placement of "annoying" ads on websites, Google is now going ahead with its ad-blocking plans and will add a feature to its Chrome browser that will block advertisements which do not meet company standards, a media report said. Google has confirmed that it intends to add a new feature to its Chrome web browser that will block certain types of ads from being seen by users and in some cases could block all the ads on websites that do not meet certain standards, Fortune reported. The company said that it wants to work with publishers to help them understand what kinds of ads will no longer be acceptable. Chrome will now include ad-blocking features that are turned on by default. Ads that meet certain annoying criteria will not be shown and if a website crosses a certain threshold of substandard ads, users won't see any ads, the report said. Some of the ad types that will be blocked include pop-ups, videos that auto-play, and so-called "pre-stitial" ads that force readers to sit through a countdown before they can see the page's contents. Since, many leading publishers rely on some or all of these strategies to boost ad revenue, Google will allow them to show users a note when their ads are blocked by third-party software. The note will give readers the option of either disabling their blocker or buying an ad-free pass or subscription of some kind for that site, the report noted.

The feature is said to be designed to help publishers who fear for their slumping ad revenue. A new extension called “Funding Choices” provides the publisher with the tool to embed into their website. When a user with an ad blocker visits the site, he is prompted to either to make a payment to remove the ads on the site, or to disable the ad blocker and proceed. Choosing neither of the options means one cannot view the website. The company is said to receive 10 percent of the fee, which will be set by a publisher individually.

The annoying ads like pop-up windows or auto-playing videos “can lead some people to block all ads—taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation,” Google’s senior vice president for ads and commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy, says. He added that ad blockers have a negative impact on potential revenue across all of Google properties, particularly in Europe. What is Google's anti-adblocking fighting?

Read more Google & Facebook control one-fifth of global ad revenue “Funding Choices allows us to have a conversation with visitors using ad blockers on how our business works, and provide them a choice to whitelist or contribute to our newsroom,” Ramaswamy said. The internet search giant is also expected to introduce its own blocker next year, which will be switched on by default in the new version of Google Chrome. Despite the tool is said to block all “unacceptable” ads, it is described as a “filter” by default, i.e. selective in blocking the ads. Identified by the Coalition for Better Ads, “unacceptable” ads are the ones making the users avoid online adverts in the first place.

Other reactions revealed some people would rather switch Chrome for another browser or boycott the anti-ad blocking sites altogether rather than watch the unwanted ads or pay for not having to watch them.

The project is the latest example of Silicon Valley attempting to reshape how goods and people are moved. But some say it also underscores a penchant for tech moguls to colour their projects with seemingly virtuous ambition. Tell a friend A lot of work goes into building an airship. Inset: Sergey Brin.Picture: AP Some people on social media seized on the vessel's apparent dual purpose. On the one hand, it's a benevolent carrier transporting food to remote, hard-pressed communities, and on the other it's a luxurious "air yacht," as the Guardian report described it, shuttling a billionaire and his inner circle to exotic locations. Google declined to comment. The vessel is reportedly being built at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. When completed, the airship will become the world's largest aircraft at about 650 feet long, although its payload is not known, according to the Guardian. Plans for the vessel, which is being funded by Brin, were first reported by Bloomberg earlier this year. Read also: Tracking down Silicon Valley's tech touchstones Experts say that the use of airships could bypass the congestion and costs tied to transporting cargo via roads, railways and airports. But lighter-than-air travel presents its own challenges, like the need to steady the aircraft by offsetting the weight of cargo once it's offloaded. According to the Guardian, Brin's vessel will use a series of internal bladders to stabilize its flight. Brin began his plans to build the vessel about three years ago, according to Bloomberg. His fascination with airships was sparked by visits to the Ames Research Center, next to the headquarters of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Ames once housed the navy airship USS Macon, which spanned about 784 feet and was among the largest aircraft of its time in the 1930s. Silicon Valley's novel charitable efforts have been criticized in the past, perhaps most prominently in the case of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's internet.org initiative, which aims to bring Internet access to the billions of people who don't have it. With altruistic motives but lucrative business prospects, some see Zuckerberg's initiative less as a magnanimous Internet project than as a version of high-tech imperialism. It's unclear whether Brin's airship will be put to commercial use. But Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet and the other co-founder of Google, has also taken a keen interest in innovative aircraft. Page has personally backed two flying-car start-ups, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. Kitty Hawk's flyer, a personal electric aircraft that hovers over water, will be available for purchase later this year.

Of course, the search giant isn’t actually calling the upcoming feature an ad-blocker, since it functions more like an ad filter. That’s because Chrome’s new powers will only eliminate bad ads which are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards. This includes intrusive autoplaying videos that play music and invasive pop-ups. Google apparently isn’t sparing itself from this new regime, stating in a blog post that it intends to block its own ads if they don’t play nice with the aforementioned standards. The move can be seen as a strike against ad-blocking software, pre-empting third-party apps by providing its own solution. Also See: Google rolls out fix for annoying page jumps in Chrome Ad-blockers usually remove all ads on a page, so Google’s way allows publishers to generate revenue from ‘good’ advertisements without turning off readers who don’t want to be attacked with frustrating ads. The brand’s additionally launched a new Ad Experience Report to help site owners determine whether the ads on their page lives up to its standards. Google’s also introduced a new Funding Choices beta program for publishers to develop alternative streams of income. They’ll be able to display a customized message to visitors who are using an ad-blocker, asking them to either allow ads or pay to get rid of them via Google Contributor. Google Contributor has been around for roughly 2 years now. It hasn’t exactly set the internet on fire, so it remains to be seen whether it’ll catch on now.

(Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

How The Promise Of The NBN Fell Short For So Many Australians Tooran Alizadeh 05 Jun 2017 11:15 AM Eight years into the Australian government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) project, the nation has an average internet speed – 50th in the global rankings – that lags well behind many advanced economy countries. Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter? Subscribe Alert me about competitions & deals Have a tip?

Image: Anindito Mukherjee/ Reuters Reliance Infrastructure Mumbai Metro on Friday announced a tie-up with Google to provide details and information about the service, an official spokesperson said here. The Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL) has collaborated with Google Maps to give the people its authentic timetable and associated geographic details on all the Metro stations on the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar route. Through the Google Maps app, the trip timings are provided on each service operated at a frequency of four minutes during peak and eight minutes in non-peak hours. The trip timings, which correspond to services provided on weekdays and on Sundays, can help commuters plan their journeys to reach their destinations faster. “We diligently explore all the possible ways of making the journey of the commuters seamless and convenient, and the tie-up with Google Maps adds another step to digitise Mumbai Metro One,” the spokesperson explained. On Google Maps app, the user can tap the Metro Services Option which opens a departure board displaying the schedules of the next few Metro services from that station in both directions. The app will also showcase facilities like stairs, escalators, elevators, ticket counters, in all the three levels of the station including road, concourse and platforms to help all commuters, regulars and new on the entire network. Maharashtra’s first Metro, the MMOPL is 11.4 km long providing a crucial east-west suburban connectivity, with 12 stations, reducing the commute between Versova-Ghatkopar from 90 minutes to barely 21 minutes now.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google’s Instant Tethering is coming to Chromebooks 06/02/2017 at 3:30 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Google rolled out Instant Tethering for Android devices earlier this year, making it easy to share your phone’s internet connection with other devices without needing to enter a password. Just enable the feature on any devices that are tied to your Google account and which support Instant Tethering, and if your tablet has no internet connection it can automatically connect to your phone… or vice versa. At launch, the feature only worked on Android devices. But it looks like it’s coming to Chromebooks. Chrome Story found an experimental option in the latest Chrome OS Canary build to enable Instant Tethering on a Chromebook. You have to go enter chrome://flags/ in the location bar, then search for the Instant Tethering flag. Turn it on, reboot the laptop, and when your Android phone is nearby it can automatically share an internet connection with your Chromebook without prompting you to connect to the network or enter a password. This option is only available in the Canary channel now, and Chrome Story notes that it doesn’t actually seem to work yet. So the feature may need further testing before it rolls out more widely. It’s also worth noting that Google’s support page says the only devices that officially support Instant Tethering so far are recent Nexus and Pixel devices. But that could change in the future, and I have to imagine the plan was always to offer support for Chromebooks at some point, since Instant Tethering that shares a connection between a smartphone and a laptop makes a lot more sense than the Android-to-Android tethering we’ve had up until now.

Really wish Google would offer both options on the Google WiFi. So you can continue to do things the old fashion way with machines and IP addresses. But add able to do things based on Google accounts. So instead of grounding a kid from Internet use by his machine instead by his account. So if he just grabs his brothers CB it will NOT work. Same with this phone, etc. All my kids have Google accounts so should be able to do this. Google wrote the Beyond Corp paper years ago and now, come on, just implement!!

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Why Bing Video Search is better than YouTube Search By Martin Brinkmann on June 3, 2017 in Internet - Last Update:June 3, 2017 27 You have a lot of options when it comes to watching videos on your devices. Most users seem to use YouTube more or less exclusively for all their family friendly video needs, but sites like Vimeo or Dailymotion are popular as well. Search on YouTube, with YouTube being a Google property, should be one of the strong features of the video streaming site, but it is not really. While it works, and even lets you filter by upload date and some additional features, it is nowhere near where it could be. It has no preview feature for instance, and while you can add it using extensions, something like it should be built-in in my opinion. I run all my video searches on Bing Video Search instead, and have two core reasons for that which I would like to explain in detail in the coming paragraphs. Note: I understand that the comparison between a single-site search engine (YouTube), and a multi-site search engine is not entirely fair. Google's own Video Search seems to focus heavily on YouTube as well however. Bing Video Search Bing Video Search is a feature of Microsoft's search engine Bing. While I don't use Bing at all for Web searches, as I find the search engine lacking in that regard -- especially for non-English queries -- I find some of Bing's other features quite useful and often superior to Google's offerings. You can use the following URL as your entry point to run video searches on Bing: https://www.bing.com/videos/ Simply enter the term you are interested in, and wait for Bing to return results to you. Results are listed with thumbnails, the source site they are hosted on, and information on views, play time, uploader, upload date and title. While most videos may be hosted on YouTube, you may get results from other sites such as Vimeo, Youku, VM, and lots of other video hosting sites as well. This depends largely on your query. This is the first advantage that Bing Video Search offers over YouTube's or Google Video's own search function. Sites like Vimeo host exclusive content for instance sometimes. A search on YouTube won't find those videos, while a search on Bing will. The second feature that makes Bing Video Search superior in my opinion is its preview feature. You can hover over any video on Bing Video Search to get a preview of the video. This preview includes sound, and is a great way to quickly determine a video's quality, and whether it matches what you are looking for. These two features are not the only ones that Bing offers. Here is a short list of other features that you may find interesting: Better filters: You can sort by date, length or resolution, or filter by a specific source. If you turn off SafeSearch, you will get NSFW results. Save videos to your Microsoft Account, and get personalized feeds based on your savings and activity. Closing Words Bing Video Search is a handy multi-site search engine for videos that returns both family friendly and NSFW results based on SafeSearch settings. Its preview feature is the feature that I like the most, as it does away with the "opening video > realizing it is not what I was looking for > going back"  workflow on YouTube. Now You: Which video search engine do you use, and why? Summary Article Name Why Bing Video Search is better than YouTube Search Description This article discusses why Bing Video Search is superior to YouTube Search, or Google Video Search when it comes to finding videos.

June 3, 2017 at 8:14 am # The clean URL is https://www.bing.com/videos/explore i like it but it causes slow down in my browser. Too bad this article will probably get little hits. Reply chesscanoe June 3, 2017 at 1:37 pm # I don't do much searching for videos, but on Windows 10 CU using latest Chrome beta on your URL causes no slowdown for me, and the preview function is really useful - a big thanks to Martin. Reply Rick A. June 3, 2017 at 4:01 pm # Yeah, the slowdown is because of my browser or maybe an extension. With the URL if you use the one in the article https://www.bing.com/videos/ it immediately changes to https://www.bing.com/videos/explore?FORM=RECMVI but if you use https://www.bing.com/videos/explore it stays that way and is what i call a clean URL. That's what i would bookmark. i never bookmark sites with "ref" and similar, i always clean the URL's first. Yeah that preview feature is nice. i know that there's an extension for Scroogle Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-preview/hmggjocpafbpjdhoknaneokaklekakeh that shows images when you hover over the thumbnails on YouTube but i found a better one for Firefox that actually plays the video and sound when you hover over the thumbnail, and it's a web extension - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yt-video-thumbs/ - Now i use another web extension Magic Actions For YouTube - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/magic-actions-for-youtube/ - and in that extension if i have the day/night feature enabled and the light switch flipped which makes YouTube dark, the thumbnail preview only plays sound and no video. Hopefully a future update for one of the extensions fixes this. Also i checked in about:performance and both extensions don't cause any performance issue at all. i recommend them. Richard Allen June 3, 2017 at 2:56 pm # Just tried the same video search on Chrome x64, Pale Moon x86, FF ESR x64, Nightly x64 and the latest Vivaldi x64 snapshot and they all worked fine, for me. I've been using Nightly this morning and was very surprised when it put a major beat down on Chrome when scrolling the page. Scrolling the video search results was very smooth in Nightly but choppy in Chrome and I will be the first to admit that Chrome is generally a performance beast. I've noticed in the past that Chrome doesn't load the GPU as hard as FF and Nightly on my system, that could explain some of the difference in scrolling performance. Also, with Pale Moon, FF and Nightly I have changed two about:config entries: mousewheel.acceleration.start=3 mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount=3 Makes a Big difference on my computers. Vivaldi had the 2nd best scrolling performance, for me, it's not bashful about loading up the GPU on graphics heavy pages. I'm using Win7 Pro.

Reply Martin Brinkmann June 3, 2017 at 8:17 am # Results depend largely on the search term. YouTube results are dominant in most areas because YouTube is home to the majority of videos on this planet. Reply Jeff June 3, 2017 at 9:50 am # With all due respect, I disagree. YouTube's filters are its killer feature. Duration/length filter, upload date and sorting make finding the right video very easy.

Reply Jeff June 3, 2017 at 6:53 pm # Ah I was using Opera where Bing DOES NOT show any filters! Got them in Chrome. Dorn June 4, 2017 at 2:15 pm # A preview-with-sound on hover feature is hugely lacking though. However, I'm not giving out my search trends to Microsoft. They already have one of my big emails from the era before ProtonMail, I don't want them to cross data. YouTube has way too much data as well but there's not much of a choice here, so... Though to be honest, videos on Youtube can be found on Dailymotion too, it's just that people insist on picking and spreading the Youtube link all the time. Makes it hard to switch to Dailymotion. Reply Tom Hawack June 4, 2017 at 3:01 pm # I agree concerning users fascination for YouTube when other video sites are available, DailyMotion of course, Vimeo as well though perhaps the latter more sophisticated (in the good sens of the word). Concerning DailyMotion, it's nice but you definitely won't find as much as you do on YouTube. The site also seems obsessed with ads to the point that pre-video advertisement is inevitable unless blocked in either of the following ways, and that is a policy I don't understand when that of a site which is loosing users day by day because mainly of YouTube : being extra-zealous with ads when theses are easily avoidable on YouTube is rather stupid IMO, not to mention that DailyMotion could work on a more attractive interface. Two ways I know to skip the in-video DailyMotion ads : 1- If using 'uBlock Origin' add to the 'My filters' section a dedicated uBO filter : @@dailymotion.com##script:inject(1136.js) 2- Use a script called 'Dailymotion Raw Html5 Player' available at GreasyFork I use the script because it ads many features to the simple fact of avoiding in-video ads, but I remember that before that uBlockO' filter made it nicely. I hope it still works because DailyMotion has spent a lot of time trying to defeat those in-video ad-blockers and may have changed their code, again, since. You don't bother people with unavoidable in-video users when your site is falling : a truly immature attitude. They already have the site ads, why ad ads to ads? Gosh! I do visit DailyMotion, and Vimeo, especially when no particular search in mind. Should DailyMotion reconsider its in-video advertisement that they could possibly increase their audience. Pity, it's otherwise a nice place, even if they could redesign it. ram sam June 3, 2017 at 11:19 am # Normally I dont prefer bing, but this seems interesting.

Besides the fact that I don't like Google's search appearance for most things, I have been getting $5 every six weeks from Bing toward Amazon for years. More importantly, the article is correct for any kind of video searching as well as most picture searching. Bing is far superior to anything Google has to offer in these areas. Reply Yuliya June 3, 2017 at 12:01 pm # Minus the audio preview, which it lacks, I think Yandex is better. UI is a lot better and lighter, also the video on the right keeps playing just fine while you can perform different searches. [https://i.imgur.com/dyNkU0K.jpg] It is amasing how YouTube does not have any form of preview in this day and age though. Reply Richard Allen June 3, 2017 at 1:43 pm # Thanks Martin! I had no idea that MS had really stepped up their game with Bing. Has some nice search filters and... video preview also? I hope Google is paying attention. It's refreshing to see MS putting out a product/service that I want to use! Now if I could only get them to quit trying to stab me in the back with Win7 updates 'my' world would be easier. :) Screenshot of Bing video search filter.

If you take a large group which you know dislikes for the most part a person, a company, an institution and you'd like them to start bashing because from your point of view they've sort of forgot doing so, the best way is to evoke that person, company, institution in flattering terms : you can be quite sure that will trigger your audience's minds, wake them up and have them put that extra layer of bashing which was missing, without yourself being considered as the "pusher". Therefor, this article, with imagination, could as well have been sponsored by, say, Google, just to remind users how much they dislike a company and for those who like it how many others just don't, to put il extra-mildly! Finally, the simple hypothesis of an article written freely, based on an experience which would appear as a good opportunity to remind us all that nothing, no one is totally bad (nor good) remains plausible :) Reply flyli5411 June 3, 2017 at 9:47 pm # IDIOT COMMENT TO MAKE It smells like it is a sponsored article from MS.

It is restricted from playback on certain sites or applications. Watch on YouTube" Why would I want to use Bing's Video Search? When I search for something and it is listed, I make the assumption that the search is valid and the link to the content is valid. I don't expect a link from the search to offer me a UK link that Bing already knows won't play in the US. A real drip of golden honey.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time.

I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

PHOTO: AFP EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the US company. The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both US and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The US company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. EU fines Facebook 110 million euros over misleading WhatsApp data Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the US Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. EU threatens Microsoft with antitrust fine over web browser Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

But smartwatches are part of a crowded and competitive market, and some brands have fallen away, such as the Microsoft Band or the discontinued Moto 360. Many high-end smartwatches have sought to emulate the success of fitness trackers, offering abilities such as heart rate monitoring, GPS and water resistance. Others have gone down a luxury route, trying to match the style of traditional timepieces. The Telegraph has broken down some of the best smartwatches for different uses to help pick a timepiece that is right for you. Should I buy a smartwatch? There has never been a better time to buy a smartwatch. Many of the teething problems in the technology have been dealt with and smartwatches have now moved beyond early adopters to become a genuine tech and style statement. The best smartwatches rival cheaper sports watches for fitness tracking performance, although you can still find good deals on the popular Fitbit and Garmin devices.  And smartwatches offer significantly to levels of connectivity with your smartphone, from answering calls to voice control, while more advanced models can offer 4G connection and contactless payments. Which smartwatch operating system is best? There are three main smartwatch operating systems, most of which offer similar capabilities but with some distinctions. Given that your smartwatch will spend lots of its time connected via Bluetooth to your smartphone, you will want to make sure you have a degree of cross compatibility, although most operating systems now work with all smartphones, whether they run on Android or iOS. WatchOS: The latest WatchOS 3 for Apple smartwatches is lightning fast with upgraded fitness apps and useful features such as theatre mode (which stops your watch waking up accidentally). It is a great system, but is best used alongside and iPhone. Android Wear: The 2.0 edition of Android Wear was a step up  with new functions including Google voice control, Android Pay and the ability to make 4G calls. It is used on most new smartwatches. TizenOS: Used for Samsung smartwatches, it has an intuitive interface and design, but is best suited to Samsung devices. It does have 4G, but currently only in the US. Do I want to use my smartwatch for sport? When buying a smartwatch you will want to consider whether you want it as a fitness aid or a fashion statement. There are some differences between smartwatches and fitness trackers. Fitness trackers often have less functionality when it comes to reading and responding to texts or emails. But plenty of smartwatches are tailored for outdoorsy types and fitness fanatics, with step and calorie counters linked to your smartphone. If you want a smartwatch for sport you should also consider one with a more durable watch face, silicon straps and waterproofing. If you prefer a smartwatch as a style accessory plenty come with leather and other materials as straps, and there are a number of watch brands that now make smartwatches, although you will pay premium for the best materials. How much should I pay for a smartwatch? Realistically, a good budget smartwatch should cost around £100 to £150. Fitbit's Blaze is probably the best cheap smartwatch, although it is simple in design and doesn't have all the features of the Android Wear operating system. Mid-range smartwatches will run between £200 and £300. At this level you should be getting Android Wear 2 software or an Apple Watch. More expensive smartwatches of £300 and up will have voice control and luxury features such as deep waterproofing. Many will also be a fashion statement to compete with the best traditional brands. Bear in mind that this technology is still developing and, like your smartphone, you may end up having to replace your smartwatch every few years, unlike the lifetime of service you could get out of a traditional watch. Other things to look out for in a smartwatch: Screen size: A screen that is too small may be fiddly to use, a screen that is too large may be heavy and chunky. Some smartwatches come in more than one size to fit different wrists. Battery life:  This is the main sticking point for many smartwatch users. Battery life can vary hugely and is unimpressive compared to any normal watch. Ideally you want at least two days of charge with limited use, with regular use you may see a lot less. Processor and storage: Most smartwatches will have similar processors that do not make huge levels to difference to performance and many come with 4GB of storage as standard. Below are some of the best smartwatches you can buy now. The latest LG Watch Style has been left out as it has not yet been released in the UK, while the Moto 360 and Microsoft Band are also out as the manufacturers have put a hold on their smartwatch ranges. The history of wearable technology 01:26 Under £250 Sony Smartwatch 3 Credit: Sony Display: 1.6 inch Operating system: Android Wear Battery life: up to two days This impressive budget smartwatch filled in a lot of the gaps left by earlier cheap devices, fitting the bill on key smartwatch capabilities without compromising on price. This Sony watch has GPS, a compass, waterproofing, calls and 4GB of internal memory for storing music on the go and works with Android Wear for all the apps you need from Facebook notifications to emails. It has Google's voice control, although not the Google Assistant of more expensive brands and later updates to Android's operating system mean this watch could become less useful. It's also not the most stylish device compared to other brands. Pros: Cheap, GPS, compass, big screen Cons: Chunky design Price: £89.99 in green, £139.89 in black Buy now Fitbit Blaze Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.25-inch Operating system: Fitbit software Battery life: up to 5 days Fitbit's Blaze is a useful little smartwatch idea at a great price. However, unlike other models it does lack the functionality of the Apple Watch or Samsung Gear, with few native apps, and with the Apple Watch proving such a good fitness tracking device the Fitbit has a lot of competition. But for almost £200 less than Apple's premium model, the Fitbit does punch above its weight. If all you need is simple tasks, such as answering or dismissing calls, all packed with Fitbit's activity tracking expertise this smartwatch is a good bet. Pros: Made for sport and running, sleep tracking, Fitbit app, battery life Cons: No voice control, limited smartwatch functionality Price: £139.95 with John Lewis, £159.99 with Fitbit Buy now Fossil Q Credit: Fossil Display: 1.4-inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: 24 hours Updated with Android Wear 2.0, the new Fossil Q smartwatch can cover the ground you need with texts, alarm, calendar alerts and a fitness tracker, as well as an LED flashlight and Google voice control to perform some simple tasks. While it does have a nice traditional look, it is actually a very bulky watch on the wrist at around 14mm, while the average 24 hour battery life is not brilliant. The leather strap does make this watch quite attractive, but means it needs some protection from water and the elements. Pros: Traditional design, plenty of custom builds,  Google Assistant voice control Cons: Fairly limited battery life, chunky Price: £188. 72 with Amazon, £229 with House of Fraser Buy now Huawei Watch Credit: Huawei Display: 1.4 Operating system: Android Wear Battery life: one and a half days If you want a smartwatch that looks more like a traditional timepiece then the original Huawei Watch is still a great bet, and now comes in as a relatively budget option in the world of smartwatches. Compared to recent new releases such as the Samsung Gear S3 it is good value and was the best Android watch around on its initial release. You can choose between leather straps or stainless steel, however the leather option will be more vulnerable to water damage. It has a sharp, circular screen with high 400 x 400 resolution. It can also be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0, which will offer more Google voice control. Pros: Premium look and good screen quality Cons: Now two years old, not waterproofed Price: £219.99 Buy now Asus Zenwatch 3 Credit: Asus Display: 1.39-inch Operating system: Android Wear 1.5 Battery life: up to two days The Asus Zenwatch is a good looking device. With the option of leather straps and a bold, bright 1.39 inch face with 400 x 400 resolution it is easy to look at. It has reasonable fitness monitoring ability and can act as a mouthpiece for taking calls on your phone. However, the current lack of an Android Wear 2 update means there are many limits such as no Google Assistant voice commands (although it does support the simpler Google Now) and limited waterproofing.   Pros: Good looks and bright screen Cons: Lacking in latest operating system Price: £229 Buy now Under £300 Apple Watch Series 1 Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.65-inch Operating system: watchOS Battery life: 18 hours regular use, up to two days While it does lack some of the more advanced features of the Series 2 such as extra waterproofing and GPS, the Apple Watch Series 1 is still a premium smartwatch. It has the easily navigable watchOS and the functionality of Siri, as well as Apple Pay. The Apple Watch is now also considered one of the top fitness watches you can buy, with intuitive fitness tracking apps and a heart rate monitor.  While Apple says its battery life should be 18 hours with regular use, most people will easily get two days out of the watch if you limit use to time checking and the odd workout. Pros: Almost as good as the Series 2, significantly cheaper Cons: Not as waterproofed and no GPS Price: £269 Buy now Samsung Gear S3 Credit: Samsung Display: 1.3-inch Operating system: Tizen Battery life: up to 4 days Samsung's latest Gear S3 watch has a classic look and plenty of features to make this a brilliant smartwatch. On this smartwatch you can rotate the bezel to perform tasks such as responding to calls or reading messages, although its touchscreen is slightly on the smaller side for a fairly large watch. It can also use S Voice for voice control to make a call or send a text, and it features Samsung Pay. It has GPS and a solid battery life, meaning you will only have to take it off for charging every few days. It comes in two designs with a rugged "frontier" version and a smart "classic" look. However, the Gear S3 does only have water resistance to a distance of 1.5 metres, limited compared to the Apple Watch Series 2. Pros: Great battery life, innovative bezel for quick functions, S Voice control Cons: Smaller screen and limited water resistance Price: £295.00 Buy now Huawei Smartwatch 2 Credit: Huawei Display: 1.2 inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: up to two days Huawei's 2017 watch outing mirrors some of the design elements of the original Huawei Watch, although the availability of its "classic" design is currently limited in the UK. As well as standard apps, Google Assistant voice control and the ability to make Android Pay contactless payments, the Huawei Watch 2 is one step ahead with integrated 4G connectivity, allowing you to make calls directly from your watch away from your phone. Downsides include battery life which, for a watch that costs this much, is a little low. It is only splash resistant and lacks GPS functions that are part of its main rival in the Apple Watch Series 2. Pros: 4G option, classic look, voice control Cons: Limited water resistance, no GPS, expensive for 4G Price: £269 from Amazon (no 4G) £299 from Amazon (with 4G), £379 from Currys (with 4G) Buy now Luxury smartwatches Apple Watch Series 2 Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.65-inch Operating system: watchOS Battery life: 18 hours regular use, up to two days The Apple Watch Series 2 is still one of the best smartwatches you can buy with tonnes of great features and running on the smooth watchOS. It has a brighter OLED (organic LED) display than its predecessor and is water resistant up to 50 metres. Other great features include a heart rate sensor, accelerometer and built-in GPS. It is, however, hit by a hefty price tag, and although the design appeals to some it is not the most stylish timepiece around. For something a little different you can pay more for a stainless steel case and metallic strap, but this pushes the price up to nearly £700. Pros: Water resistant, sharp screen, watchOS, GPS Cons: Expensive, battery life, no sleep tracking Price: £396 for aluminium case, £699 with stainless steel case and Milanese loop Buy now Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Credit: TAG Heuer Display: 1.39 inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: 25 hours with regular use Luxury Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer was never going to be the cheapest option. If you are willing to shell out more than £1,000 on a smartwatch then you can with the Connected Modular 45. It has a striking look, while its modular flexibility makes for great customisation, although this in a sense loses the more iconic look of some Swiss watches. It has GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, although no 4G (which is likely to become standard on the more expensive smartwatches). It also has no heart rate monitor, making it a little less useful for fitness fans. If style is your main concern, the Tag Heuer ticks the boxes, but with smartwatches likely to keep evolving it may be too much of an investment just yet. Pros: Premium build and design Cons:  Price: £1,200 from Tag Heuer, £5,700 (with diamond studded bezel) Buy now Best technology you can buy grid   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics TAG Heuer Android Apple Watch Smartwatches Apple Show more Technology latest 05 Jun 2017, 12:01am Comment: As AI moves on, it's time for Apple's Siri to grow up James Titcomb Premium 04 Jun 2017, 11:13am When is WWDC 2017 and what will Tim Cook and Apple announce? 04 Jun 2017, 11:12am WWDC 2017: iOS 11 best features and release date, plus everything we know about Apple's new software 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Price comparison site Kelkoo takes Google to High Court over abuse of search dominance 03 Jun 2017, 6:00am The British scientists on the brink of changing the human race forever Premium 03 Jun 2017, 3:09am A wizard idea?
