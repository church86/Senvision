The saying goes one should quit when you are winning. This might hold true for many trades, but there is one trade for which this should be ignored. It's the so-called FANGs, or Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (through parent company Alphabet). The FANG stocks have returned nearly 30 percent year-to-date versus 8 percent for the S&P 500. According to a note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch last week: "Active managers continued to double down on tech (with their exposure increasing by +12.6 percent in the first quarter) along with a 71 percent overweight in FANG stocks." What is more remarkable is that the latter stayed steady over the last year, but the rally in FANGs has been driven by active managers who were once bearish on the trade, throwing in the towel and covering their short positions. Resistance is futile, it seems. show chapters Fundstrat: Stick with FANG, telecom, energy, and financials    Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 12:27 PM ET | 03:55 Yet, the warnings of exuberance have been plentiful. And those warnings are not new. For years have we been reminded of the similarities to the 2000 tech bubble. But this time it's different. Comparisons to the 2000 tech bubble are ill placed, as now 17 years later the companies in question are hugely profitable and have strong recurring revenue streams. We have also been warned about the narrow leadership in the S&P thanks to tech, now that the reflation trade is flagging. In my view, the word narrow misses the point. These firms have higher market capitalizations than the German DAX index and the French CAC. I would call that impressive leadership. Lastly, we have we been hearing about of the sky-high valuations of the tech sector for years. Most recently that the price-to-earnings ratio of the U.S. tech sector hit 27, which is deemed outrageously expensive for any other sector. One of the analysts ignoring the argument of excessive valuations is Cyrus Mewawalla, founder and CEO at CM Research. On CNBC last week, he told me "for many aspects of tech, traditional valuations and discounted cash flow models are simply not applicable. Some of these big themes like artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, they don't exist commercially yet. But we know they are going to be big and we kind of know who is going to lead them. This tech rally has some way to go." show chapters Here's how much FANG stocks can still soar: Tom Lee    Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 5:08 PM ET | 05:12 Even more so, it seems like a few winners will take it all. According to Mewawalla, all the big themes that are coming out in the next two years, are benefitting the big ones much more than the broad tech sector. Take cloud computing for example, which requires huge investment by the likes of Google, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft. Similarly, AR (augmented reality), or autonomous vehicles require big data sets, which is why Microsoft bought LinkedIn or why IBM bought Proven Health Analytics. Mewawalla adds that he has a "buy" rating on all FANG stocks and does not think any of them are overvalued. Mark Hawtin, investment director at GAM, goes one step further by saying recently on CNBC that the FANG stocks are still cheap despite hitting consecutive record highs, adding Facebook is the cheapest stock in his portfolio on a price-to-growth basis. The message from the investment community is clear. Follow the leader, follow this rally. It might be frustrating if you haven't been in it from the start, but it is not too late. This tech rally which has been defying all odds, is here to stay. Carolin Roth is based in London and is an anchor for Street Signs as well as covering the Swiss market for CNBC.

McElwain Chamber News Museum AP Apple unveils first new product in years By MICHAEL LIEDTKE and BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writers Jun 6, 2017 0 SAN JOSE, California -- Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple's HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple's first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. ---- Ortutay reported from New York × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

The “HomePod” speaker unveiled yesterday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice-activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced since the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. Research firm eMarketer said more than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year.

Leonid Bershidsky Google controls more than 40% of the US digital ad market. Photo: Reuters Google, which controls more than 40% of the US digital ad market, has decided to teach the world which ads are acceptable and which aren’t. Starting next year, its Chrome web browser will block all ads — including those bought through Google — on websites that don’t follow guidelines set by an industry group. This monopolistic move is meant to save the digital ad industry from itself. It would also have the side effects of making Google’s business model more sustainable. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s senior vice-president for ads and commerce, delivered the warning to website owners in a recent blog post. Chrome, he wrote, won’t show any advertising on sites that try to run ads that are designated as annoying by the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that, apart from Google, includes the second digital ad powerhouse — Facebook, as well as content creators such as News Corp. and The Washington Post and major advertisers such as Procter & Gamble. The group has researched user experiences and concluded that internet users hate pop-up ads, self-launching videos with sound, countdown ads that make one wait before a page loads, and large sticky ads that don’t go away as you scroll. Google is not the first browser maker to build in ad blocking functionality. Last year, Norway-based Opera Software did so, saying it wanted to motivate the industry to stop annoying viewers and increasing website load times. Like Google, Opera also declared it supported lighter ad formats, but didn’t pick and choose websites on which to filter out advertising. Now, about a third of Opera users have turned on the blocking feature. But there are too few of them to count: Opera commands a 3.5% global market share. Chrome, with 54%, dwarfs all other players, and its threat to stop showing ads on certain sites is essentially an order to change or die. It’s not a nice move. Many will see it as a power grab aimed at weakening other players, who are already losing share to Google and Facebook. Content creators could point out that the two giants sell some of the most irritating ad formats, but the Coalition for Better Ads has no problem with them. Instead, it’s helping Google wage war on the formats that bring in the most revenue for publishers. So why would Google expose itself to new accusations of abusing its monopoly position, especially given that its business keeps growing and so does the global digital ad market, which is expected to reach $223.7 billion this year and continue to make double-digit leaps until at least 2020? Google founders and executives have built such a powerful company because they have never allowed themselves to get stuck in the present or the near future. And the medium term looks troubling for the digital ad industry because of the quickly growing use of ad blockers. On desktop computers, the use of such software is increasing while web traffic from them is going down. But that’s not what should worry Google, whose strategy is based on mobile dominance; on mobile devices, the use of ad blockers is rocketing. In 2016, Google’s ad sales increased about 18%. The number of mobile devices that use an ad blocker grew 38% (to 380 million), according to PageFair. Much of that growth is in Asia, one of the most promising regions for advertisers. Increasingly, Google and other companies exploiting advertising-based business models are facing a world in which ads are sold, providing a robust revenue stream, but people find ways to opt out of looking at them. That gives fraud — primarily the practice of “showing” ads to bots rather than real people — an increasing weight in the industry’s total revenues. Google needs to get real people to keep looking at ads, and it appears to believe that making other people’s ads less intrusive is the way toward that goal. I doubt it’s going to solve the problem, mainly because the guidelines are written in a way that ensures that viewers will continue to see annoying ads from Google and Facebook — if not from many other sites. Google appears to believe that the digital ad market’s fundamental contradiction between people’s desire for free content and their annoyance with ads is a matter of balance. That belief is apparently shared by some content producers: A few of them have signed up for Google’s relaunched Contributor program, which allows sites to charge a small fee — usually $0.01 per page — to show a visitor no ads at all. But the program did badly before the relaunch, and very few content sites have signed up for it now. To most readers, paying to see no ads is essentially like paying protection money — something to be avoided with the help of a comprehensive ad blocker, not a pro-Google, pro-Facebook one. Content creators, like any other manufacturers, are on shaky ground when people can consume their product free of charge. A strong paid subscription base is the only good insurance against a future digital advertising crisis, which Google is trying to stave off with its attempt to join a trend it can’t beat.

Apple event highlights the rise of the smart speaker Chris Keall Tuesday June 6, 2017 3 Share Photographers get a first look at Apple's HomePod smart speaker at the company's WWDC in San Francisco this morning (Apple) Play NBR radio on Apple’s WorldWide Developer’s Conference this morning had got a lot stronger buzz on social media than some of its recent events. I could see the attraction. A lot of that hardware and software looked great … but some of it was also overdue, perhaps reminding investors Apple is behind rivals in a couple of key areas. The event took place while the Nasdaq was still open; Apple shares closed down 0.99% (the broader index was down 0.16%). Apple’s biggest announcement was the HomePod, a speaker with a built-in virtual assistant (Siri) that will sell for $US349 from December. The Wall Street Journal says Amazon has already sold $1 billion worth of product in its Echo smart speaker range, which utilises the company’s virtual assistant Alexa. Google Home is nipping at its heels. About 36 million Americans will use a voice-enabled speaker at least once a month this year – more than twice as many as a year ago – according to eMarketer, a market-research firm (and it will be mostly Americans. Amazon and Google’s smart speakers are only sold inside the US, though quite a few Kiwis have DIY-imported one or the other. Both get good marks for coping with the Kiwi accent). I’m watching a bit of US television at the moment (via Hulu on Apple TV), and Amazon Echo and Google Home ads are on very high-rotate. Sales seem to be taking off, and you can see why Apple is keen to get into this area as smartphone sales plateau. While Amazon and Google promote their speakers as butlers – you can ask them a question or order a service – basically, anything you can do via voice commands on your smartphone, Apple seems to be pitching HomePod as the smart speaker that sounds good, too. Respected US reviewer Harry McCracken says it does sound pretty good for a speaker of its size too – at least in Apple’s demo. Apple-Amazon truce Although the two companies will soon be at war in the speaker market, they seem to have reached a detente on other fronts. Apple said today that there will soon be an Apple TV app for Amazon’s Prime Video service (the new home of the show formerly known as Top Gear). And although there has been no official announcement, US media says Apple products will return to Amazon’s home page, after a two-year absence, as a quid pro quo. Apple Music a big business WWDC also saw the announcement that the Apple Music service now has 27 million paying subscribers — up from 20 million in December and 13 million a little more than one year ago. $US9.99 (cheapest monthly plan) x 27 million subs = $US270m per month or around $US3.2 billion per year. And that's on top of however many songs Apple sells through iTunes. The music business is alive an well — just in differences that it used to be.

The June security update is now available for download for Pixel and Nexus devices. Although these updates generally will come over the air at some point, if you are in dire need of installing the latest you'll want to head to the source link down below to download the correct image for your model. Like every month, Google has patched many different security holes in its Android OS, the details of which can be found on its security bulletin website. While this initial release is just for Google's Pixel and Nexus devices, Android partners like Samsung have been notified of the vulnerabilities a month prior and should have their own updates available at some point for their respective products. As mentioned previously, for those curious, you can head to the source link down below to download the image for your device. Before doing so, you'll want to backup any personal data on the device, as the manual update with the full ROM will delete everything and return the software back to a stock state. However, if you download the OTA files, you will be able to update and still retain your data.

Check out the latest theme park experiences and attractions News Alert: Live video: Ex-FBI Director James Comey testifies Business Apple unveils 'HomePod' speaker, its first new product in years The iMac Pro was revealed and touted as the most powerful Mac ever. (June 5, 2017) The iMac Pro was revealed and touted as the most powerful Mac ever. (June 5, 2017) Michael Liedtke and Barbara OrtutayAssociated Press Privacy Policy Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Ortutay reported from New York Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Apple Inc.

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the five-day WWDC with announcements of a a new operating system, a new iPad Pro and a the HomePod, a music speaker and home assistant. WWDC runs through June 9. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/AFP JUSTIN SULLIVAN / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / AFP Apple on Monday unveiled its “HomePod” speaker as it moved to challenge Amazon Alexa and Google Home as a smart home and music hub. HomePod, powered Apple’s Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual developers conference. “It’s so cool, we really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said of the new device. HomePod will taking Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have been building momentum in the market for voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the Siri team at Apple had tuned the assistant into a “musicologist” that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the “power to rock the house,” according to Schiller, who said the team worked to make HomePod an potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. – Playing to strength – HomePod capped a keynote presentation at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference that included updates to its iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs available on HomePod. “Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. “The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market so far.” Some industry insiders, however, note that Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Amazon has dominated the category of connected speakers since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods or rides and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8 percent for Google Home and 5.6 percent for others including Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. – Macs and iPads – Cook used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan’s devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named “High Sierra” in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and “intelligent tracking prevention” that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple provided look at an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. The iMac Pro was to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999. Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its mapping program. Apple also released a software kit so developers could infuse augmented reality into applications for iPhones or iPads. Given the hundreds of millions of Apple mobile devices in use, that will create the largest augmented reality platform in the world “overnight,” executives said.

Eight years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial intelligence products is as fundamental to the company's next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone in sleekly-designed hardware and services.   AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple's rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn't profile consumers. Moreover, Apple's longstanding penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country's top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. WWDC 2017: Apple Launches 10.5-Inch iPad Pro and Refreshes 12.9-Inch Model; India Launch Later This Month "Artificial intelligence is not in Apple's DNA," said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Steve Munster. "They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot." At Apple's annual developer's conference on Monday - the same event where Jobs introduced Siri - the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new standalone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri's chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. "Machine learning" - an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultra-fast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling - was repeated throughout the 2.5 hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute - or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company's Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, HomePod. She will automatically organise your photos into albums, like "2nd Anniversary," without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software toolkit, CoreML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It's six times faster than Google's rival AI processor, an executive quipped). WWDC 2017: New iMac Models With Intel Kaby Lake Announced; iMac Pro Unveiled But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence, ranging from software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully-functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind - and where the effort cuts against the core aspects of the company's secretive culture. "This is a substantial shift for Apple," said Daniel Gross, a former executive who focused on artificial intelligence. "The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers." Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company's revenues, which were $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company's iconic smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones is finally saturated. Apple Unveils App Store Redesign with Today, Apps, and Game Tabs at WWDC 2017 "The difference between last year's iPhone and this year's iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. ... So that s-curve is starting to flatten out," said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. "Then you have the next transformative technology, that isn't here yet." Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple's launch of HomePod, which will go for sale for $349 later this year, comes several years after Amazon and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers' spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday's updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified web search that could tell the occasional pre-programmed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as "deep" or "unsupervised" learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain's neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protege of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world's top researcher in this area. Like Salakhutdinov, who divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple, Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products, but becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. "You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do," Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper in artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a prestigious computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was "off the scale" in terms of secrecy, and that such secrecy was keeping them out of loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino giant was "making some changes." "But it's going to take some work," he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates - Google, Facebook, and Amazon were by far the top picks - but that the company was moving up in the rankings. Apple's forays into AI have also been slower than its peers because it's been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy when it did so. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer's conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people's speech in order to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations, and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise - or bad information - into good data in order to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn't know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple's focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. "Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science, and doing so to try and preserve your privacy," he said. "I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving." Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. "The bad news is that Apple is behind," he said. "The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it's still early days - there is plenty of time to catch up." © 2017 The Washington Post We discussed everything Apple announced at WWDC 2017 on Orbital, our weekly technology podcast.

When the Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday in San Jose, California, the iPhone maker is likely to unveil iPads and Mac laptops along with new versions of the operating systems for those devices, according to people familiar with the plans. Cook may even lift the cover on a smart speaker based on the Siri virtual assistant. It will be the first time Apple has presented new hardware at the conference since 2013. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has for more than a year been showcasing the strength of Apple’s services businesses, such as the App Store and iCloud storage, in part a reflection of a dearth of new blockbuster gadgets and slowing growth for Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone. Now as the device pipeline fills, the company is shining more of the spotlight on hardware to woo the developers needed to create accompanying apps. The company will also try to win over programmers with updates to Apple’s operating systems for computers, mobile devices, Apple TV and Watch. “They’re there to spoil the developer community,” said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research. Debuting a smart speaker competitor to Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and the Google Home at WWDC would be a logical step, since it would give developers the tools to build apps for the device before its release later in the year.  “They may not be able to put enough information into the developer community without showing them the hardware too,” said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. “It will be part of a broader strategy that says these are devices that are interesting now and we need to let our customers know about them.” Amazon makes little or no profit selling the high-end $179 Echo, which mostly serves as a foothold in consumers’ homes and a way to get them to sign up for Amazon Prime and buy more products. Google Home, which sells for $129, is a window to Google’s plethora of services from Search to YouTube Red music streaming and its Calendar app.   It isn’t yet clear how much Apple will charge for its own smart speaker. But it may also be a play to boost the profitable services business, which last year generated revenue of more than $24 billion -- or 11 percent of total sales. There’s plenty of incentive for developers to get behind the new gadget. So far this year, they have reaped about $10 billion from the App Store. WWDC follows similar events held recently by Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. At those gatherings, the software giants sought to burnish their credentials in augmented reality and artificial intelligence. Like Google, Apple has been developing its own dedicated processor for AI, according to a person familiar with the plan. Analysts expect Apple to show off improvements to Siri and advances in AR technology as part of the iOS 11 mobile operating system, which will hint at features in the next iPhone to be introduced later this year. “AI will play a larger role with this release by leveraging enhanced capabilities around Siri,” Brian White, a Drexel Hamilton analyst, wrote in a note to clients. “Given our view that the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will come with 3D sensing technology, we expect some AR-related features to be integrated into iOS 11.” The updated operating system will also include the second revamp of the Apple Music streaming service in as many years. With the company planning as many as 10 original television series by the end of this year, the update will make video content far more prominent, Apple’s music guru Jimmy Iovine told Bloomberg in April.

Interconnected technology is now an inescapable reality – ordering our groceries, monitoring our cities and sucking up vast amounts of data along the way. The promise is that it will benefit us all – but how can it? By Adam Greenfield Interconnected technology is now an inescapable reality – ordering our groceries, monitoring our cities and sucking up vast amounts of data along the way. The promise is that it will benefit us all – but how can it? By Adam Greenfield Rise of the machines: who is the ‘internet of things’ good for? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In San Francisco, a young engineer hopes to “optimise” his life through sensors that track his heart rate, respiration and sleep cycle. In Copenhagen, a bus running two minutes behind schedule transmits its location and passenger count to the municipal traffic signal network, which extends the time of the green light at each of the next three intersections long enough for its driver to make up some time. In Davao City in the Philippines, an unsecured webcam overlooks the storeroom of a fast food stand, allowing anyone to peer in on all its comings and goings. What links these wildly different circumstances is a vision of connected devices now being sold to us as the “internet of things”. The technologist Mike Kuniavsky, a pioneer of this idea, characterises it as a state of being in which “computation and data communication [are] embedded in, and distributed through, our entire environment”. I prefer to see it for what it is: the colonisation of everyday life by information processing. Though it can often feel as if this colonisation proceeds of its own momentum, distinct ambitions are being served wherever and however the internet of things appears. The internet of things isn’t a single technology. About all that connects the various devices, services, vendors and efforts involved is the end goal they serve: capturing data that can then be used to measure and control the world around us. Whenever a project has such imperial designs on our everyday lives, it is vital that we ask just what ideas underpin it and whose interests it serves. Although the internet of things retains a certain sprawling and formless quality, we can get a far more concrete sense of what it involves by looking at how it appears at each of three scales: that of our bodies (where the effort is referred to as the “quantified self”), our homes (“the smart home”) and our public spaces (“the smart city”). Each of these examples illuminates a different aspect of the challenge presented to us by the internet of things, and each has something distinct to teach us. At the most intimate scale, the internet of things is visible in the form of wearable biometric sensors. The simplest of these are little more than networked digital pedometers, which count steps, measure the distance a person has traversed, and furnish an estimate of the calories burned in the course of this activity. More elaborate models measure heart rate, breathing, skin temperature and even perspiration. If wearable biometric devices such as Fitbits and Apple Watches are, in theory, aimed at rigorous self-mastery, the colonisation of the domestic environment by similarly networked products and services is intended to deliver a very different experience: convenience. The aim of such “smart home” efforts is to short-circuit the process of reflection that stands between having a desire and fulfilling that desire by buying something. Right now, the perfect example of this is a gadget being sold by Amazon, known as the Dash Button. Many internet-of-things devices are little more than some conventional object with networked connectivity tacked on. The Dash Button is the precise opposite, a thing in the world that could not have existed without the internet. I cannot improve on Amazon’s own description of this curious object and how it works, so I’ll repeat it here: “Amazon Dash Button is a Wi-Fi-connected device that reorders your favourite item with the press of a button. To use Dash Button, simply download the Amazon app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Then, sign into your Amazon Prime account, connect Dash Button to Wi-Fi, and select the product you want to reorder. Once connected, a single press on Dash Button automatically places your order.” In other words: single-purpose electronic devices, each dedicated to an individual branded item, that you press when you’re running low. Pressing a Dash Button specific to your preferred pet food, washing powder or bottled water automatically composes an order request to Amazon for that one product. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An Amazon Dash button I don’t for a second want to downplay the value of such a product for people who have ageing parents to look after, or kids to drop off at daycare, or for whom simply getting in the car to pick up some cat food may take an hour or more out of their day. But the benefit to the individual customer is tiny compared with what Amazon gains. Sure, you never run out of cat food. But Amazon gets data on the time and place of your need, as well as its frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is an asset, and you can be sure that Amazon will exploit it in every way its terms and conditions permit – including by using it to develop behavioural models that map our desires in high resolution, so as to target them with even greater efficiency in the future. Again, the aim of devices such as the Dash Button is to permit the user to accomplish commercial transactions with as little conscious thought as possible – not even the few moments it takes to tap out commands on the touchscreen of a phone or tablet. The data on what the industry calls “conversion” is as clear as it is unremitting: with every box to tick or form to fill, the percentage of users that make it all the way to checkout tumbles. The fewer steps there are in a transaction, the more likely people are to spend their money. Manufacturers, enticed by the revenue potential of conquering the domestic environment, keep trying to eliminate these steps, in the hope that one of their connected products will become as essential to everyday life as the smartphone. The recent industry push toward the “smart home” is simply the latest version of this. For the moment, this strategy is centred on so-called smart speakers, a first generation of which have now reached the market. These products include the Amazon Echo and Google Home, each of which is supposed to function as the command hub of a connected domestic environment. Amazon’s Echo is a simple cylinder, while the Google Home is a bevelled ovoid. But the physical form of such speakers is all but irrelevant, as their primary job is to function as a branded “virtual assistant”, providing a simple, integrated way to access the numerous digital controls scattered throughout the contemporary home – from lighting and entertainment to security, heating, cooling and ventilation systems. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple each offer their own such assistant, based on natural-language speech recognition. Most are given female names, voices and personalities, presumably based on research indicating that users of all genders prefer to interact with women. Apple’s is called Siri and will, according to reports, soon be getting its own device, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana, while one simply addresses Google’s Home offering as “Google.” At first, such devices seem harmless enough. They sit patiently and quietly at the periphery of our awareness, and we only speak to them when we need them. But when we consider them more carefully, a more problematic picture emerges. This is how Google’s assistant works: you mention to it that you’re in the mood for Italian food, and then, in the words of one New York Times article, it “will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app”. This example shows that though the choices these assistants offer us are presented as neutral, they are based on numerous inbuilt assumptions that many of us would question if we were to truly scrutinise them. Ask restaurateurs and front-of-house workers what they think of OpenTable, for example, and you will swiftly learn that one person’s convenience is another’s accelerated pace of work, or worse. You’ll learn that restaurants offering reservations via the service are, according to the website Serious Eats, “required to use the company’s proprietary floor-management system, which means leasing hardware and using OpenTable-specific software”, and that OpenTable retains ownership of all the data generated in this way. You’ll also learn that OpenTable takes a cut on reservations per seated diner, which obviously adds up to a significant amount on a busy night. Conscientious diners have therefore been known to bypass the ostensible convenience of OpenTable, and make whatever reservations they have to by phone. By contrast, Google Home’s frictionless default to making reservations via OpenTable normalises the choice to use that service. This is not accidental. It reflects the largely preconscious valuations, priorities and internalised beliefs of the people who devised Google Home. As throughout the industry, that is a remarkably homogeneous cohort of young designers and engineers. But more important than the degree of similarity they bear to one another is how different they are from everyone else. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Getty/Guardian Design Internet-of-things devices are generally conceived by people who have completely assimilated services such as Uber, Airbnb and Apple Pay into their daily lives, at a time when figures from the Washington DC-based Pew Research Center suggest that a significant percentage of the population has never used or even heard of them. For the people who design these products, these services are normal, and so, over time, they become normalised for everyone else. There are other challenges presented by this way of interacting with networked information. It’s difficult, for example, for a user to determine whether the options they are being offered by a virtual assistant result from what the industry calls an “organic” return – something that legitimately came up as the result of a search process – or from paid placement. But the main problem with the virtual assistant is that it fosters an approach to the world that is literally thoughtless, leaving users disinclined to sit out any prolonged frustration of desire, and ever less critical about the processes that result in gratification. Virtual assistants are listening to everything that transpires in their presence, and are doing so at all times. As voice-activated interfaces, they must be constantly attentive in order to detect when the “wake word” that rouses them is spoken. In this way, they are able to harvest data that might be used to refine targeted advertising, or for other commercial purposes that are only disclosed deep in the terms and conditions that govern their use. The logic operating here is that of preemptive capture: the notion that companies such as Amazon and Google might as well trawl up everything they can, because no one knows what value might be derived from it in the future. This leads to situations that might be comical, were it not for what they imply about the networking of our domestic environments. These stories circulate as cautionary tales: one of the best-known was the time the US National Public Radio network aired a story about the Amazon Echo, and various cues spoken on the broadcast were interpreted as commands by Echos belonging to members of the audience, causing domestic chaos. Put aside for one moment the question of disproportionate benefit – the idea that you as the user derive a little convenience from your embrace of a virtual assistant, while its provider gets everything – all the data about your life and all its value. Let’s simply consider what gets lost in the ideology of convenience that underlies this conception of the internet of things. Are the constraints presented to us by life in the non-connected world really so onerous? Is it really so difficult to wait until you get home before you preheat the oven? And is it worth giving away so much, just to be able to do so remotely? Most of us are by now aware that our mobile phones are constantly harvesting information about our whereabouts and activities. But we tend to be relatively ignorant of the degree to which the contemporary streetscape has also been enabled to collect information. This development is often called the “smart city”. If the ambition beneath the instrumentation of the body is ostensible self-mastery, and that of the home is convenience, the ambition at the heart of the smart city is nothing other than control – the desire to achieve a more efficient use of space, energy and other resources. A broad range of networked information-gathering devices are increasingly being deployed in public space, including CCTV cameras; advertisements and vending machines equipped with biometric sensors; and the indoor micropositioning systems known as “beacons” that, when combined with a smartphone app, send signals providing information about nearby products and services. The picture we are left with is that of our surroundings furiously vacuuming up information, every square metre of seemingly banal pavement yielding so much data about its uses and its users that nobody yet knows what to do with it all. And it is at this scale of activity that the guiding ideology of the internet of things comes into clearest focus. The strongest and most explicit articulation of this ideology in the definition of a smart city has been offered by the house journal of the engineering company Siemens: “Several decades from now, cities will have countless autonomous, intelligently functioning IT systems that will have perfect knowledge of users’ habits and energy consumption, and provide optimum service ... The goal of such a city is to optimally regulate and control resources by means of autonomous IT systems.” There is a clear philosophical position, even a worldview, behind all of this: that the world is in principle perfectly knowable, its contents enumerable and their relations capable of being meaningfully encoded in a technical system, without bias or distortion. As applied to the affairs of cities, this is effectively an argument that there is one and only one correct solution to each identified need; that this solution can be arrived at algorithmically, via the operations of a technical system furnished with the proper inputs; and that this solution is something that can be encoded in public policy, without distortion. (Left unstated, but strongly implicit, is the presumption that whatever policies are arrived at in this way will be applied transparently, dispassionately and in a manner free from politics.) Every aspect of this argument is questionable. Perhaps most obviously, the claim that anything at all is perfectly knowable is perverse. However thoroughly sensors might be deployed in a city, they will only ever capture what is amenable to being captured. In other words, they will not be able to pick up every single piece of information necessary to the formulation of sound civic policy. Other, all-too-human distortions inevitably colour the data collected. For instance, people may consciously adapt to produce metrics favourable to them. A police officer under pressure to “make quota” may focus on infractions that she would ordinarily overlook, while conversely, her precinct commander, under pressure to present the city as ever-safer, may downwardly classify a felony assault as a simple misdemeanour. This is the phenomenon known to viewers of The Wire as “juking the stats,” and it is particularly likely to occur when financial or other incentives depend on achieving a performance threshold. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Getty/Guardian Design There is also the question of interpretation. Advocates of smart cities often seem to proceed as if it is self-evident that each of our acts has a single, salient meaning, which can be recognised, made sense of and acted upon remotely by an automated system, without any possibility of error. The most prominent advocates of this approach appear to believe that no particular act of interpretation is involved in making use of any data retrieved from the world in this way. But data is never “just” data, and to assert otherwise is to lend inherently political and interested decisions an unmerited gloss of scientific objectivity. The truth is that data is easily skewed, depending on how it is collected. Different values for air pollution in a given location can be produced by varying the height at which a sensor is mounted by a few metres. Perceptions of risk in a neighbourhood can be transformed by slightly altering the taxonomy used to classify reported crimes. And anyone who has ever worked in opinion polling knows how sensitive the results are to the precise wording of a survey. The bold claim of “perfect” knowledge appears incompatible with the messy reality of all known information-processing systems, the human individuals and institutions that make use of them and, more broadly, with the world as we experience it. In fact, it is astonishing that any experienced engineer would ever be so unwary as to claim perfection on behalf of any computational system, no matter how powerful. The notion that there is one and only one solution to urban problems is also deeply puzzling. Cities are made up of individuals and communities who often have competing preferences, and it is impossible to fully satisfy all of them at the same time. That such a solution, if it even existed, could be arrived at algorithmically is also implausible. Assume, for the sake of argument, that there did exist a master formula capable of balancing the needs of all of a city’s competing constituencies. It certainly would be convenient if this golden mean could be determined automatically and consistently. But the wholesale surrender of municipal management to an algorithmic toolset seems to place an undue amount of trust in the party responsible for authoring the algorithm. If the formulas behind this vision of future cities turn out to be anything like the ones used in the current generation of computational models, life-altering decisions will hinge on the interaction of poorly defined and subjective values. The output generated by such a procedure may turn on half-clever abstractions, in which complex circumstances resistant to direct measurement are reduced to more easily determined proxy values: average walking speed stands in for the “pace” of urban life, while the number of patent applications constitutes an index of “innovation”, and so on. Quite simply, we need to understand that creating an algorithm intended to guide the distribution of civic resources is itself a political act. And, at least for now, nowhere in the current smart-city literature is there any suggestion that either algorithms or their designers would be subject to the ordinary processes of democratic accountability. And finally, it is difficult to believe that any such findings would ever be translated into public policy in a manner free from politics. Policy recommendations derived from computational models are only rarely applied to questions as politically sensitive as resource allocation without some intermediate tuning taking place. Inconvenient results may be suppressed, arbitrarily overridden by more heavily weighted decision factors, or simply ignored. As matters now stand, the claim of perfect competence that is implicit in most smart-city rhetoric is incommensurate with everything we know about the way technical systems work. It also flies in the face of everything we know about how cities work. The architects of the smart city have failed to reckon with the reality of power, and the ability of elites to suppress policy directions that don’t serve their interests. At best, the technocratic notion that the analysis of sensor-derived data would ever be permitted to drive municipal policy is naive. At worst, though, it ignores the lessons of history. So, yes: the internet of things presents many new possibilities, and it would be foolish to dismiss those possibilities out of hand. But we would also be wise to approach the entire domain with scepticism, and in particular to resist the attempts of companies to gather ever more data about our lives – no matter how much ease, convenience and self-mastery we are told they are offering us.

By Chris Duckett | June 6, 2017 -- 03:55 GMT (20:55 PDT) | Topic: Security The cavalcade of global political leaders deciding the internet is to blame for modern radicalisation has continued at pace in Australia, with opposition leader Bill Shorten calling on social media companies to step up. MUST-READ: SECURITY Governments stand ready to regulate a cyberscape they do not understand As governments become more attuned to the threats posed in the IT space, the first reaction is to reflexively clamp down on them. Read More "It is time for everyone to join the fight against terrorism," Shorten said to reporters on Tuesday. "It is time for Twitter, Facebook, and Google to join the fight against terrorism." "We need to make it clear that everyone can do their part to keep our country and our people safe and it is time for big internet to also join this fight." The opposition leader said it was no good fighting 21st Century battles with 20th Century weapons, and that terrorists should not be able to hide online. Shorten's comments arrive on the heels of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull saying the same clutch of companies were too tolerant of extremist material. However, Turnbull went one step further and called on the private sector to help bust the encryption of their users. "We need these global social media messaging companies to assist in providing access to encrypted communications, which are used by billions of people," Turnbull said on Monday. "The security services need to get access to them." Labor has not responded to requests for comment from ZDNet on the party's stance towards breaking encryption posed yesterday. Over the weekend, British Prime Minister Theresa May called for the introduction of rules to "deprive the extremists of their safe spaces online", and also hit out at technology firms for not doing enough. "We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. Yet, that is precisely what the internet and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide," said May.

However, the marketing world viewed the move more warily, with trepidation to the growing power of Google. Currently, Google and Facebook dominate the digital advertising industry; the two companies reportedly accounted for 89 percent of all digital ad revenue growth in 2016 according to the IAB. And antitrust experts and media industry leaders are concerned about any move that would give the tech conglomerates even more market power. Google Chrome is already the most-used web browser in the US, with a 44.5% market share. According to the blog post, Google's ad blocker will be turned on by default, screening content and flagging advertisements that don't conform to standards laid out by the industry trade group Coalition for Better Ads. If a website consistently violates these standards though, the filter will then block all ads on that website. In addition to the ad blocker, Google also announced the introduction of a tool called “Funding Choices” that will allow publishers to ask readers to either disable ad blockers or pay to view content without ads — and Google would get a cut of the payment. It's this tool that has those in marketing questioning the approach, as well as, the overwhelming power the ad blocker would give Google. Here's how the marketing world responded: Preethy Vaidyanathan, SVP Product at Tapad Consumers dislike intrusive advertising, so a filter to weed out the industry's bad actors is seemingly good in theory. Advertising, however, fuels a free internet. Google's new ad blocking Chrome extension is a conflict of interest. This is Google's monolithic attempt to write the rules to ad blocking, while simultaneously circumventing its own policies to ensure publishers (and in turn, Google) still get paid. Google is writing the rules of what an "intrusive" ad means, setting up Google payment platform workarounds; they are both building the walls while collecting admission to view the gardens. Instead of acting as consumer advocates, with this extension consumers will no longer dictate the rules to content. Consumers will not be able to access certain publisher content without paying. Google's payment platforms will become the new shepherd to the internet, with the Google Chrome ad blocker creating a gated marketplace. What marketers can learn from Google's ad blocker launch is the importance of personalization and creativity in attracting consumers. Brands that solidly understand who their ideal customers are will be able to pivot their advertisements to provide informative, engaging and educational utility. Udayan Bose, CEO of search marketing company NetElixir. It could mean the rise of in-app advertising. Budgets and focus may shift towards in-app advertisements due to GoogleFilter. Once the ad block feature will get implemented, the majority of user would not have to go for a third party software to block ads. This will effectively reduce Google's dependency on software like Adblock Plus, and result in significant revenue growth for Google. The ad blocker will not make a big impact on AdWords/DoubleClick display ads. In fact, the market share may marginally grow as smaller advertising platforms with borderline ad practice like text link ads, interstitial ads apparently will be thrown under the bus. While this step is definitely pro-consumer, we believe it also helps Google extend its already substantial influence and control on the industry. There are two important trends that support this step – a) extensive use of ad blockers by millennials and GenZ b) Mobile has displaced desktop as the first screen. Both these trends will only grow in the future and Google wants to increase its influence and reach therein. Tim Sleath, VP, Product Management at Exponential On the one hand, I can only applaud the move to fewer, better ads and acknowledge the Coalition for Better Ads are involved in deciding what constitutes a “bad ad”. I will shed no tears for the impact this has on Eyeo's self-appointed judge, jury, executioner approach. However, I can only lament that the option to go “ad-free” requires users to pay via Google Play…and, therefore, be logged in to transact using Google. We are seeing the friction as the internet develops from something open into a collection of very large walled gardens (walled jungles?), with the open part of the internet increasingly marginalized – and that should give everyone pause. Rich Sutton, CRO Trusted Media Brands Since the industry starting buzzing about Google's solution, I've been in favor of it. It's in everyone's best interest, including Google's, to improve the audience experience and eliminate advertising that is unreasonably interruptive. This industry shift allows the ad tech ecosystem to be held accountable for creating experiences that are truly consumer-friendly. Marketers will be challenged to incorporate more human interaction alongside their technology solutions. They'll be challenged even more so now to think like a consumer and produce experiences consumers would want to interact with. Most importantly, marketers will be challenged to develop new and innovative campaigns that engage a consumer in an authentic way and run on brand safe platforms. Google will be the driving force behind all of us to adapt our strategies and ultimately win the loyalty of the consumer.

Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. Here are the highlights: Siri-Powered Speaker An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Apple says it’s giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple’s Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. A New, Smarter Siri With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and center. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. About Your Privacy Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker’s always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple’s servers until you say, “Hey, Siri.” The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon’s Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won’t know who you are — it’ll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. A Different Reality Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come “as the technology hits an inflection point.” In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple’s new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change that. New Hardware Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. Updates for the iPhone and iPad With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new “do not disturb” mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel.

The State Of Advanced Website Builders By Drew Thomas June 5th, 2017 CMSCodingMobile 33 Comments Advanced website builders — the tools provided by Squarespace1, Wix2, Weebly3, The Grid214 and more — produce websites that look and feel like they were designed and coded by humans. They’re also software as a service, which is a different business model than traditional, custom-developed websites. So, should companies use them? At some point, will they replace custom development? In short, yes. Self-serve website-builder platforms are quietly becoming very powerful. A lot of us write them off without much thought, but it’s time for agencies and custom development shops to pay attention. It won’t be hard to stay ahead of the builders… once we acknowledge they’re coming for us. Further Reading on SmashingMag: Link Designing For Content Management Systems5 A Comprehensive Guide To HTTP/2 Server Push6 Be Afraid Of HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)7 The Current State Of Authentication: We Have A Password Problem8 What Is An Advanced Website Builder? Link In 2004, the year my web design agency incorporated, a professional website experience cost six figures and took half a year or more to launch. Today, a business can buy a website on Squarespace for $12 per month and be live the same day. Squarespace is an advanced website builder. It’s a subscription service where, without code, you can build and serve a website for your business. It offers only templated design, little or no help with copy, and nothing in the way of advanced user experience design. However, the templates are very slick, businesses often pull content from other places, and the basic user experience is excellent. Basically, Squarespace works for a lot of businesses. As standards solidify, websites are in danger of becoming commoditized. Instead of a custom website, money will be spent on social media, bots, email automation and all kinds of other things. For a growing number of businesses, the website is already becoming a box to check off, and money is going into other areas. Squarespace doesn’t work for most businesses today, but that will not always be true. Functionality, quality and customizations will keep getting better. The Current Website Market Link Established best practices and improved browser technologies allow website builders to deliver a lot of value out of the box. Essentially, they cover all of the baseline requirements for a solid website — from SEO to responsive design to professional visual representation. Just a few years ago, only custom development could deliver that baseline value. Now website platform companies are doing it at scale. Scale gives the builders unprecedented flexibility in pricing, and it’s changing the website industry. Most businesses today need more than a baseline website, but there are a lot that don’t. If website builders can automate coding and deliver the same value as custom websites, the market will notice. Why would a consumer pay more and wait longer to get the same value? To be clear, I didn’t say the same product. I said the same value. Websites created with templates and builders aren’t going to win awards — but they can win business. Custom Development Is Not Doomed Link There are plenty of reasons to go with custom development today, but there are four main needs that advanced website-building tools can’t meet. I’d consider these the selling points of custom web development. These are the things we can tell potential clients so that they hire us, instead of using a website builder. One reason I felt compelled to write this article, though, is that it’s getting harder to sell custom development on these points alone. Trailblazing Experiences Link Remember Arcade Fire’s Wilderness Downtown9 video, which integrated with Google Maps and zoomed in on your exact house as part of the video’s storyline? Squarespace can’t make that. Or how about the Andersson-Wise website10 in the early days of responsive design? Or how about responsive web design itself? The builders couldn’t have invented responsive web design. Humans (well, a human) had to custom develop it first. The web was forged by pioneers who took the tools available to them and pushed the limits. Experimentation and the wow factor will be around forever. Security Link Security is hard at scale, and for governments and other super-sensitive organizations, being on a third-party platform and paying monthly is not secure enough. Even in cases where custom development is potentially less secure than a platform, just the thought of putting security in the hands of a third-party is enough to deter some organizations. Custom Integrations Link Similar to security, some organizations require integrations and workflows that wouldn’t be available within website builders made for the masses. Custom integrations are particularly important for legacy businesses and systems. If you’re using all the latest software as a service to run your business, then website builders are magic. If you’re the airline industry11, they’re not even an option. This one is getting tricky, because basic integrations are already part of the builders. If you use Google Analytics, MailChimp and Wistia, then you’re good with builders. If you have a custom Salesforce or NetSuite set up that needs to work with your website, you’ll definitely want to go custom. This is a huge opportunity for custom web developers. As technology permeates every part of every business, there’s a real need for advanced integrations and workflows — the kind that website builders might never be able to touch. Platforms Link As “basic” web development moves towards commoditization, businesses will look to advanced web development to stand out. Creating platforms for businesses and/or their customers is another opportunity. I’m using the term platform to include website builder platforms, content management systems, account and project management portals, and similar web-based products. They could be customer-facing or internal, but they all help people accomplish tasks. Projects like these are as custom as one business to the next, so they seem safe against builders for the foreseeable future. However, I still recommend managing advanced web development projects more like the builders (i.e. more like SaaS) to stay competitive. Ultimately, I believe that most custom development shops will actually turn into website platform companies. It’s a logical evolution. Development Isn’t Everything Link Code is just one part of a website. Custom development typically comes with expertise in other areas, including business consulting. Website builders can help with things like the basic user experience, email automation and analytics reporting, but they still expect the business owners to do things themselves. They’re a tool, not a consultant. This is a critical distinction, because even if website builders take a majority of custom development work off the table, businesses will still need visual and user experience designers. Then, if the templates get so good that designers aren’t needed, businesses will need copywriters. Et cetera. Ultimately, as more things are done automatically, businesses will look to specialized (read “custom”) execution to stand out. Another opportunity. This parallels the TV and film industry. It used to take expensive equipment, airtime deals and a large crew to get on TV. Now with a mobile phone and Internet access, anyone can broadcast to millions on YouTube. The broadcasting process was commoditized. Now broadcasting itself no longer means much. It takes stage presence, great content, organized presentation and more to get attention amongst all the other broadcasters. Website builders are the YouTube of our industry, but like YouTube, that doesn’t actually say much about their quality or effectiveness. That’s to be determined. It does say that they’re going to put a lot more websites on the Internet and create competition in our industry. Fortunately, agencies and custom development shops are not doomed. The landscape is changing for sure, but as it gets more accessible and more competitive, there’s a growing need for experts. Stay Competitive Link There’s a classic rule in service businesses: good, fast, cheap… choose two. Advanced website builders are the exception. They build something good, slowly and expensively at first, but they license it to the world quickly and cheaply. The result is an advantage that’s hard to match with custom development. This is the main reason that custom developers and the website industry should pay attention to the builders. For clients, getting something fast and cheap means they’ll let a little bit of good slide. Great is always better than good, but if great costs more and takes longer, good may be enough. That’s why the builders are dangerous. They won’t make better websites than we do, but they only need to make websites that are good enough. To stay competitive, we need to keep an open mind. Below are the areas that custom development needs to pay attention to. Without updating current business models, most agencies and custom development shops won’t be able to compete. Integrations Link The web today is all about integrations. Every service has an API, and importing, exporting and combining data is essential to modern business. If a website isn’t reporting metrics, capturing emails and funneling leads in 2017, it’s not doing its job. Custom developers can integrate services, but website builders come with integrations built into their platforms, and website owners pick and choose the services they want to use — at any time, and usually at no extra cost. Look at the list of Squarespace integrations12 that are completely out of the box. This is stuff that you click to enable, and it works on your website instantly. It also fully supports third-party integrations, 24/7. Can your clients call you at 3:00 am about their Wistia video integration? The Wix App Market13 is an example of both integrations and the sheer functionality that is made drag-and-droppable by builders. (Like it or not, it’s impressive.) As each website builder’s list of integrations grows, it gets harder and harder to compete with on price and speed. Another example is Shopify’s14 Google Analytics advanced e-commerce integration. E-commerce businesses can report extensively on e-commerce activity in Google Analytics by setting up their property and website correctly. Store owners can track a full sales funnel, from referral source through to purchase, within Analytics for free. This only works if you have everything set up correctly, though, and the setup can get in depth. With Shopify, all of that works out of the box, no setup required. Same for the e-commerce conversions in your Facebook account. If custom development shops evolve into platform companies, then integrations would get built once. Without a platform, it gets really expensive to build them project by project. Pricing Link It seems impossible to compete on price and offer the same features as the builders, because their business models are fundamentally different than agencies and custom development shops. As long as consumers find value in their products, the website builders’ pricing model will remain very attractive. Over time, website buyers will learn to expect a better product for less money — custom or not. Below is a breakdown of pricing for the popular website builders. You can see there’s still some room for custom developers to get creative and compete, but these prices are depressingly low compared to custom development. Beyond the pricing tiers in this chart, website builders offer more expensive monthly plans, one-time paid upgrades, and often a third-party marketplace for paid plugins. This chart is the lowest “business-level” pricing tier for each service. Brochure website E-commerce website Squarespace $18/month $18/month Wix $14/month $17/month Weebly $25/month $25/month Shopify n/a $29/month The Grid $8/month Coming 2017 GoDaddy $9.99/month $29.99/month The interesting thing about the monthly pricing model is that the buyer pays forever (as long as the website is up). The payments are low, though, so it would take 20 years to equal the high up-front cost of most custom development. Not to mention, all of the builders include hosting in their price. Getting paid monthly forever has its upside for an agency, though. Agencies and development shops should think about what features or services they can add on and upsell over time, so that they can charge less up front or only a low monthly fee. Shifting the focus to customer lifetime value from a single project’s value provides a lot of opportunity to get creative with pricing and service models. It also encourages better work. Design Link Website design has shifted in the last few years. There was once a focus on creativity and brand experience, but now there is a general emphasis on usability, familiarity and compatibility. Of course, there are brands that push their design, but in the grand scheme of all businesses, they’re not the majority. For example, does a law firm’s website require cutting-edge design? It needs to look professional and be on brand, but it mostly needs to load fast and be understood quickly on any device. With most website builder services, you choose a design as the first step. And it’s not vague or conceptual — you look at finished designs and choose one. You see exactly what the website will look like, and you can assume it will generally be bug-free and polished. 15 Squarespace templates16 (View large version17) 18 Wix templates19 (View large version20) This seems counter-intuitive to designers, but it’s actually super-intuitive for non-design minds. In addition, it’s more or less a given that the design will be responsive (except for Wix, but they use a separately designed mobile version). Similar to the integrations, the platforms are doing responsive at scale, so they typically cover a much broader range of devices and circumstances than a custom-developed website. The Grid214 takes the streamlined design process a step further and designs itself. So does Wix ADI22. Based on some questions and the content you provide, the layout and structure of the website adapt and evolve. The website owner doesn’t need to think about design at all, and their visitors get a professional experience. Wondering about quality? Judge for yourself: Fast Company Innovation Festival23 (Squarespace), Sago Hotel24 (Wix) and Wafia25 (The Grid). Design is amazingly important, and most businesses today realize this, but it’s not unique design that’s valued — it’s effective design. That small distinction could help reframe things for designers who might not see it from a purely business perspective (not that anything should be viewed from a purely business perspective). Custom design and development shops just need to rethink their process. Typically, no two agency-client design processes are that much alike, and results vary wildly from client to client (even within the same agency). This is a sticky point for clients. The appeal of seeing a final design — knowing what they’re getting, knowing how much they’ll pay — is great, and it’s hard to compete with. The way that custom design can win is by focusing the process on education and expertise. The agency learns everything about the company, brand and mission, and they use their experience and expertise to present the one correct solution. That pitch would certainly make me rethink my ability to choose from 10 prebuilt templates. Dashboards (The New Content Management Systems) Link Another underserviced area where advanced builders are pulling ahead is dashboards. Signing into Squarespace or Wix is unlike seeing traditional content management system back ends. The dashboards are more like SaaS dashboards — beautifully designed and usually offering overview metrics, business insight and intelligent content suggestions (in addition to upselling). The value for the business goes beyond the ability to update their content. 26 Part of the Wix dashboard27 (View large version28) Furthermore, most or all of the major providers offer app versions of their dashboards. This might seem trivial, but to the market, it’s a big plus. You never have to sign in or even remember a web address, and you can get push notifications when things happen with your website. It’s challenging under the current model to add back-end-only dashboard features, but when done correctly, it’s a place to upsell and create tangible business value. Another opportunity. Customer Support and Website Maintenance Link The last areas that advanced website builders have an advantage in is ongoing customer service and self-serve front-end maintenance. Agencies and development shops typically deliver a content management system for content updates, but often it stops there. As businesses grow and change, they might want to update more than content and imagery. For example, a business might need a one-off landing page, a campaign-specific lead-capture form or a new third-party integration. This level of self-serve customization is at the core of website-building platforms and doesn’t cost more money. Potential clients understand this. In addition, if a website owner can’t figure out something on their own, 24/7 customer support is a call or email away. Knowing that free support and upgrades are available goes a long way towards making a purchasing decision. It’s hard to imagine agencies building and supporting a website in that way for just $20 or $30 each month, but if agencies don’t find a way to make that happen (or provide additional value proportional to the higher cost), customers will use the builders. Actionable Steps In Today’s Market Link Ultimately, I’m a big believer in the market. Too many companies force their products or services on a market that has moved on or never existed. In the past, an eye-catching website was a way for businesses to get some attention or gain an advantage over their competitors, and websites were challenging to produce. Today, however, a large percentage of websites use established layouts and patterns, and they’re easier to make than ever. Everyone needs a website, but it’s not really about the website. For businesses, it’s about their content, brand and offering. The vehicle to deliver those things evolves — whether it’s made in Flash, handcoded HTML, WordPress, Tumblr, AngularJS, React, Squarespace or something else entirely. Facebook business pages even fall into this category. If the content, brand and offering are what is important, how can we use our knowledge and experience as web people to promote those things? Can we optimize content and streamline content creation? What can we do to showcase brand values? Can we automate a marketing funnel? Or increase sales through an excellent user experience? We could potentially use the builders to create the website itself and sell those services on top! Our jobs as web developers and web experts aren’t eliminated if we don’t make actual websites — we move up. Looking Forward Link I’m not trying to upend anyone’s business or career path. I’m trying to ensure we all grow as an industry. In a few years, the industry might look nothing like it does now. Those of us who ignore advanced website builders (and ignore the larger market) will fall behind, and those who pay attention will be just fine. In fact, those of us who pay attention have the opportunity to seriously improve our products, our businesses and our clients’ businesses. That’s the message. This is a truly exciting time for the web industry, and it’s a great time to honestly evaluate what our clients want and need. More importantly, it’s time to acknowledge the competition from advanced website builders and to understand the things they’re doing right. We don’t have to use templates, charge pennies and answer clients at 3:00 am, but we do need always to provide more value than we cost and to put our clients’ needs before our own.

It comes with all the things you need to create a basic website but it also includes some unique features like the ability to submit data directly from your website to your contact lists and then send emails to them. In addition there’s integrated messaging that really helps your site come alive. You can also see who’s on your website and where they came from with Analytics.

Personally, I find the advanced website builders to have replaced the neighbour’s nerdy nephew as the budget solution of choice. In both cases, they supply me with work as the customer starts to understand what a website is and can do – and wants one that does more. Which is where several of your points come in. Excellent observations. Reply 22 4 Drew Thomas June 5, 2017 6:46 pm Thank you, Ricky. The nerdy nephew is a great comparison! Reply 3 5 Michael Borum June 5, 2017 7:08 pm I couldn’t agree more. I have worked with businesses in the past, but today most of my clients are individuals (usually artists and writers) and non-profits. Artists and writers know the value of their time, and most will never pretend to be aspiring web designers. They prefer to stay in their own lane, as it were, and understand the inherent value of paying a professional to do it for them. Non-profits must be wise about how to spend money, but many know better than to be a penny wise and a pound foolish. They’re almost always under-resourced as it is, and genuinely need the extra help, even if it costs more. I have, on numerous occasions, recommended site-builders (namely Squarespace or Wix), and encouraged prospective clients to give it a try. Some have, most haven’t, because once they realize they’re setting themselves up to learn something they may not want to learn, or are taking on a whole new set of responsibilities (it is hard enough for many of them to keep up with their social media profiles), they are more than happy to pay me to do it. I agree that site-builders have their place, but there will always be room for added-value, high-touch, high-quality bespoke service.

Custom website development will still be relevant for the big guys. Where there are multiple people that have to give a “go” for content change requests. Where CI is very important, so that only certain website-elements can be changed according to rules. For everyone else, advanced website builders will likely deliver enough value. Small website agencies will have to “pivot” to stay relevant. Most small agencies won’t realize this until it’s too late. “The winter is coming” ;) Reply 6 11 Brian June 5, 2017 7:22 pm Small agencies might pivot to recasting themselves as experts with an advanced web builder, as many others have with ecommerce platforms. Reply 7 12 Serj June 5, 2017 9:27 pm Advanced website builders are for web developers who can made some changes in the code, example of website builder is Slides – https://designmodo.com/slides/. Why you don’t mention this type of website builders? Reply -17 13 Peter Steele June 5, 2017 10:37 pm The one issue the author completely neglects is the increasingly complex methods of creating a site. By the very nature of “everything is javascript” philosophy that pervades website development these days, it’s essentially pushed people to look at a more simplified means to create their website. People don’t want to have to be JS developers to build a static website – quite the opposite. The path of least resistance has then become these companies that offer a simple, effective way to build websites that are based on proven technologies. The additional services just make it more appealing and an easier decision to sign up for their monthly services. Front-end developers have made their roles so complex, they have self selected themselves out of the market. Reply 2 14 Andy Mather June 6, 2017 12:17 am Great to hear as my business is based on creating websites for small to medium businesses using http://www.webydo.com which is aimed at designers who don’t code, it has great features and I charge less up front but charge a monthly fee for maintenance, hosting and changes. I must add the cost is a little pricey at £150 per month for up to 30 sites, hence the monthly fees. Reply -16 15 Nigel Wilson June 6, 2017 4:42 am Great thought provoking article and overall agree with the message delivered. One aspect that website builders do have a lot of “catch up” to do is code optimisation – providing the breadth of functionality does come at a cost and with high focus on optimisation for search engine rankings this is one aspect that automated services will (IMHO) struggle with over custom development. Having said website builder software can definitely be the “go to” depending on the circumstances / budget. Reply 5 16 Eduardo Weidman Barijan June 7, 2017 6:30 pm Point taken on the optimizations for SEO. We are an advertising agency and we do a lot of work using WordPress and Joomla for instance as well as custom solutions using PHP and Laravel. We get a lot of clients that were using those advanced site builders and everytime we could see that the site was not ranked at all in Google, for instance! Now that is big! Also we are based on Brazil so the country may be relevant as well but as we could see checking the sources of those builders is that in the case of Wix as an example, everything is Javascript! Everything, the page is a big script tag with a lot of coded data that do make the page. We all know how that plays in the SEO field. As a counter example, even our simple sites without optimizations at all do rank at Google during their lifespan. That is huge! Just by having a proper HTML and the content that is parseable by the search engines. And yes, using WordPress and Joomla as I mentioned. So I think custom made development will stay for a long while if they keep their “all is JS” mentality. Reply 0 17 Sarabjeet Singh June 6, 2017 5:51 am talking about advanced builders? I think you missed TemplateToaster from this list! Reply -19 18 Andrew June 6, 2017 8:38 am In general, I agree with the author, and as a custom web designer/developer, I already have to refocus my business to creative, ads and branding. Website builders are taking my niche and this is the doom. But I tried all 3 links of a working examples, and only Squarespace-driven site performed well on my iPad. Other’s loading time were extremely slow, and customer will probably close the tab that stays just blank over 10 seconds. Thus, performance and optimization is a significant milestone that site builders are still to pass.

Reply 8 23 Max Firouzmand June 6, 2017 4:37 pm I think it does not have enough market share comparing to others in the list. Maybe that’s why. Also I think Webflow is -unlike others in the list- exactly a custom website building tool not a website building platform for end users such as what this article is discussing. Reply 9 24 Charles Desaulniers June 6, 2017 6:20 pm They do offer hosting and a CMS that can go over it. Reply 8 25 Carlos A Rosario June 6, 2017 3:08 pm Good article. Personally, I don’t understand any coding nor site development, but, I find the advanced website builders like Squarespace that I am using already one year has great features and outstanding presentation and performed well on my divices. Reply 1 26 Babek Azimzade June 6, 2017 3:45 pm Why no mention of Webflow? I think unlike Wix and Squarespace, Webflow fills a huge gap in website builder tools! Reply 26 27 Stuart June 6, 2017 4:26 pm I think in general, services like Squarespace, Wix, etc. are best suited for brochure ware sites, and trying to compete on brochure ware is a race to the bottom. Besides price, there isn’t much a professional developer can compete on. Sure we can optimize, write more efficient mark-up and JS, but for the most part, the customer doesn’t care or doesn’t see the value. Yes, we’ll adapt and change our business model to stay ahead of the game, but Squarespace will also adapt and become more proficient and competent. This is the new norm, and the pace we’re forced to change at is only going to get quicker. Reply 4 28 Sarah June 6, 2017 6:25 pm Really awesome article and totally on-point. I come from a design and development background but now run a small design shop specialising in working exclusively in one of these platforms. I think these platforms can exist pretty harmoniously alongside those of us who develop. I’m still adding custom code to each of my sites so they don’t look or feel in any way ‘cookie cutter’. Sure, they’re not built on a totally blank canvas but they are unique and the design is well thought out. It just saves me having to re-invent the wheel each time to get started, and for that I am very grateful! Reply 3 29 John Flickinger June 6, 2017 6:28 pm I completely agree that website builders are improving in a variety of ways. However with that being said, I believe that most of this article applies to brochure sites almost exclusively. It would be difficult for a website builder to replace something like a complex Hybris commerce website with a lot of business rules baked in, and custom pricing for dozens of customer groups for example. I’ve also worked on a lot of websites that started out as sites built with website builders. These sites had content populated by people with no usability experience and had convoluted structures that only made sense to the person who wrote it. They didn’t account for SEO, and the copy could have used a professional copywriter’s touch. My point is that while yes, these tools have a place and when used properly they are capable of making a good website, but I have trouble believing that they are much of a threat to professional web developers. Reply 5 30 Josiah Schaefer June 6, 2017 6:34 pm I would argue that custom development is still relevant for smaller companies/organizations if they need to resolve problems like branding and organization, ect.. There is still something to be said for people who know how to shape a website design around a company’s unique business and branding, even with smaller companies. On the flip side, I imagine tools like Webflow could still be used to accomplish this, but Wix and Squarespace not so much. Still possible but much less flexible. Reply 19 31 Joel Davies June 6, 2017 6:51 pm One thing I’ve noticed about the website builders: their templates largely seem to tilt toward fashion-marketing or creative portfolios. I suspect the reason is these outfits live and die on the attractiveness of their templates, so you get lots of gorgeous, enormous images eating up the page and 12 words of copy. Even their blog templates are top-heavy with visuals and light on content. Most of our clients need the exact opposite and don’t have huge budgets for photography. That said, it is hard to argue with the commodification economics laid out by the author. Perhaps mastering robust free-form layouts via CSS Grid when it deploys widely will be a way for creative developers to differentiate themselves during the Rise of the Machines. Reply 3 32 Simon grant June 7, 2017 10:03 am Automation breeds automation. So, ultimately the Computer is completing the evolution it was meant to: a machine capable achieving tasks independently of human agency ( also known as artificial intelligence ). You can’t argue with that! Reply 0 33 Jonathan Clark June 7, 2017 1:01 pm You make some really solid points. However, content will always drive effective design and that has never been truer than today. I’ve been developing website since 2002 and it’s rare that I meet a business owner who is able to tell their brand’s story in a compelling way. Website building tools are just that – tools. Content development with a focus on SEO is the value proposition today. Reply 2 Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Reuters (2) More On: apple Apple could help government agencies spy on us Apple to let other shops use its fancy machine for iPhone repairs Apple really wants you to watch 'Planet of the Apps' Apple is selling a strip of leather for $29 SAN JOSE, Calif. — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker’s ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple’s technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. No place like HomePod The “HomePod” speaker unveiled at Apple’s annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple’s iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple’s own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod’s owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. “It will reinvent home audio,” boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Apple vs. the dry spell The HomePod is Apple’s first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn’t been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company’s ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs’ last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it’s also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple’s assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) “This is the start of the AI wars,” he said. Macs, phones and payments Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality “experiences,” although the company didn’t announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple’s web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It’s part of Apple’s effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You BENGALURU: Technology giant Google is deepening its engagements with startups in India and is working with a bunch of "highgrowth" ventures as part of a global programme to mentor and deepen its technical engagement with the potential winners of tomorrow. Over the past year, Google has been working with Indian startups like social networking site ShareChat, food delivery apps Swiggy and FreshMenu as well as utility applications UrbanClap and HealthifyMe, as a part of its global "Sand Hill" programme, according to a top company executive. The search giant has also partnered with 15 top venture capital firms like Accel, Sequoia, Kalaari, Inventus Captial, Lightspeed Ventures among others to identify the hottest startups in the ecosystem. "Sand Hill is where we partner with top VCs in the world and get them to recommend highgrowth companies to us... Not very early startups, but companies which have a bit of velocity are selected and offered the best of Google's expertise," said Rajan Anandan, managing director, Google India. The chosen startups typically will have received first to the third round of institutional funding. Once selected, Google provides mentorship, early access to new products and helps in improving product design and analytics. The programme derives its name from Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California which is notable for the concentration of venture capital companies. Globally, there are close to 150 startups that have been handpicked by Google and their VC partners which include the likes of Airbnb, EventBrite and Meitu. "They offer mentorship and support across all Google products from Google AdWords, analytics, maps, Android, Play etc. We were able to talk to an Android expert, who was so great that in half an hour, we got a long list of recommendations on how to improve our app," said Rashmi Daga, founder, FreshMenu, adding, "We even spoke to a machine learning (ML) expert who advised us on how to set up an ML architecture and use it in our platform." FreshMenu had access to the beta version of Google's food discovery app Areo, said Daga. Google's engagement with the startup ecosystem began about two years ago as the founding partners of Nasscom's 10,000 Startups programme. India has about 5,000 startups and is ranked as the third-largest startup hub in the world. Google also offers other kinds of support for Indian startups including a six-month mentorship programme where companies receive $20,000 of cloud credits. In addition, the investment arm of the search giant, 'Capital G' has already pumped money into five Indian startups, Freshdesk, Practo, CommonFloor, CarDekho and Cuemath.

HomePod, aided by Apple’s Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. “We really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said as he unveiled it. HomePod will take on lower priced Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have had momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. It is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company’s Siri team had tuned the assistant into a “musicologist” that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the “power to rock the house,” according to Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. Playing to strength HomePod capped a keynote presentation that included updates to Apple’s iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs. “Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. “The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market.” Some industry insiders, however, note Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Apple has given Siri new male and female voices, described as more natural and expressive, and added abilities such as translating English phrases into Chinese, French, German, Italian or Spanish. Apple said it is also using ‘on-device learning’ to enable Siri to take people’s tastes into account. Amazon has dominated the connected speakers category since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8 percent for Google Home. Macs and iPads Cook also used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan’s devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named “High Sierra” in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and “intelligent tracking prevention” that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple unveiled an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. Aimed at high-end design professionals rather than the home market, the iMac Pro is to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999. Mac models were also boosted to work with virtual reality gear, a move by Apple into technology that Facebook has embraced with its Oculus unit. Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its map program. And the operating system for mobile devices is getting a major update with iOS 11. Changes included making iPads more efficient and being able to send money to friends using Apple’s messaging application for mobile devices. A set of iOS 11 features including enabling smartphone cameras to read QR codes are aimed at the China market, where Apple would like to bolster iPhone sales. AFP AFP/CC Share.

Apple iOS 11 hidden features: WiFi sharing, FLAC audio support and more Xiaomi, Apple keep top spots in global wearable segment in Q1 2017: IDC Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker’s ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple’s technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The “HomePod” speaker unveiled at Apple’s annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple’s iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple’s own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod’s owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. “It will reinvent home audio,” boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. (Source: AP) The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the US., UK and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple’s first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn’t been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company’s ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs’ last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it’s also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple’s assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) “This is the start of the AI wars,” he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality “experiences,” although the company didn’t announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple’s web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. (Source: AP) Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It’s part of Apple’s effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Apple's John Ternus speaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print SAN JOSE, California — Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Related Items Tim Cook , Apple inc , Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Amazon Prime Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

More videos Trump blasts 'fake news media' On his return to the US, Donald Trump claims the reports his son-in-law tried to set up a secret channel of communications with Moscow were 'fake news'. Fund manager Arjuna Capital will ask shareholders to vote on a resolution that would force the web giant to review the impact of fake news on its network on democracy and report back to investors. The move comes at the same time governments are examining greater regulation and transparency of online communication partly to combat terrorism.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link President Donald Trump has used the phrase 'fake news' to dismiss many news stories.  Photo: AP Fairfax Media can reveal that Ms Hoffs, a founding member of 1980s power pop band The Bangles, and Mr Roach, who directed the Austin Powers and Meet the Parents movies, match the names of two shareholders that Arjuna has nominated as the clients behind the drive for transparency at the tech companies' annual meetings.  The proposal for Google's parent, Alphabet Inc, states: "Shareholders request Alphabet issue a report...reviewing the public policy issues associated with fake news (as well as associated hate speech) enabled for Google AdSense Internet advertising mechanisms. Advertisement "The report should review the impact of current fake news flow and management systems on the democratic process, free speech, and a cohesive society, as well as reputational and operational risks from potential public policy developments".  The proposal is similar to the one defeated at Facebook's annual meeting.   SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Google founders Larry Page (left), and Sergey Brin. Google will face a vote from shareholders at this week's annual general meeting asking for greater transparency and action on fake news.  Photo: Stuart Ramson/AP 'Threat to democracy' Arjuna's managing director, Natasha Lamb, who confirmed to Fairfax Media her clients are from the entertainment industry, told the Facebook meeting on June 1 that "fake news is not about spin or confirmation bias—It's about fabrication...And when fabrication is disseminated so easily at scale, the way we have seen through Facebook's social media, it represents a threat to our democracy." "We are talking about content that is posted and disseminated with the intent to mis-lead, not the mainstream media which the President (Donald Trump) refers to as fake news." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Facebook, founded and led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, did not receive enough shareholder votes to start reporting on fake news.  Photo: Bloomberg When asked to confirm the clients were the famous singer and her director husband Ms Lamb declined to comment. Arjuna manages about $US180 million ($A241 million) and Ms Lamb is not confident the proposal will pass at Google's meeting on Wednesday, given "insiders control more than 50 per cent of the voting power", she told Fairfax Media. But she hopes the board and management will heed shareholders concerns.  SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Bangles founder and member Susanna Hoffs. Photo: Getty Images Alphabet is urging shareholders to vote against the proposal, stating it already does extensive work on bad advertising practices. "Google believes strongly in the freedom of expression, but also recognises the need to protect the quality of the AdSense network for users, advertisers and publishers," it states. It already reviewed 550 sites and kicked out 200 publishers, it added.  SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Austin Powers director, Jay Roach. Photo: Getty Images British scrutiny These shareholder votes come just days before the UK general election, where Theresa May has made internet regulation a key election policy.  In the wake of Saturday's terrorist attack in London, Ms May said the internet in general provides terrorism with a "the safe space it needs to breed".  SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Director Jay Roach (top, center) with cast members at the Goldmember red carpet. Photo: AP The Conservative party's election policy paper, Forward Together, promises a re-elected government would push internet companies to "develop technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda".  It was the UK government which sparked a global boycott of YouTube in April after finding out UK government ads were appearing alongside terrorist and hate videos, potentially providing advertising revenue to the video's creators. Google, which owns YouTube, acted swiftly, and has since revealed its chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, had "literally thousands and thousands of calls [and] in-person conversations" with advertisers to stem the boycott.  Fairfax Media contacted several Australian companies that pulled advertising in April to ask if they had returned to YouTube, including Seek, Bunnings, and Telstra.  "After a period of suspended advertising SEEK has turned on YouTube advertising in a limited and cautious capacity. We are practising constant vigilance across this and other internet advertising network," a spokeswoman said.  Boycott continues But Bunnings and Telstra still have not returned to YouTube. A Bunnings spokeswoman this week said it has "suspended all YouTube advertising whilst we work with Google to find a solution". Telstra spokesman Steve Carey said: "Our pause on all advertising on YouTube remains until we are satisfied that the platform can deliver on these strict brand guidelines". "Telstra has very strict guidelines around our brand and the type of content we believe is acceptable for it to appear with. We continue to review our position with Google and have an ongoing dialogue with them around this."  Omnicom Media Group's chief executive in Australia, Peter Horgan, said it uses an 'inclusion only' list when placing ads for clients, which means brands appear on sites or next to videos that are handpicked.  And it has been working closely with Google to protect brands, but advertisers now realise that no platform is totally brand safe.   "Our clients have either returned, or are assessing what criteria will allow them to make a formal return," Mr Horgan told Fairfax Media.  The impact of the YouTube boycott on Alphabet's revenue has not yet been revealed.  The latest results only cover the first quarter of 2017, which ended on March 31. The financial impact won't be reported until first half results are published in late July.  Class A shares in Alphabet Inc stalled around $US841 during the boycott, but this week reached record highs of $US1003. Facebook shares are also at record highs of $US153.63.   Founding partner of Jevons Global, Kingsley Jones, shorted Alphabet stocks when the boycott first started, but cancelled his position before the results.  "It was clear by that time that management had contained the spread of the boycott," Mr Jones said.  "The cost of addressing the problem will likely be spread over several quarters while the direct revenue impact was confined to the back of the quarter. We probably won't know the true impact versus the counter-scenario that it never happened." He added the furore died down after Google reached out to advertisers and started restricting ads to YouTube channels with at least 10,000 views, but it remains to be seen if a "machine-learning approach will deliver on automated content filtering".  Originally published on smh.com.au as 'Bangles founder and Austin Powers director's secret fight against fake news'. 3 comments Log in to comment New User?

Apple's HomePod speaker pumps up the volume on tech rivals by: MICHAEL LIEDTKE and BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writers Updated: Jun 5, 2017 - 8:47 PM SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers - the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad - all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Apple’s HomePod Apple Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference 2017 (WWDC) started today with the traditional keynote speech announcing Apple’s new and upgraded software and hardware. The overall takeaway from the announcements showed the increasing convergence of the mobile platform, especially the iPads with desktop computing. Artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality have also become a focus for all platforms. It would be easy to couch these announcements as moves to combat similar products and capabilities from Google and Amazon, especially in the case of the Apple’s new HomePod smart speaker. However, in the case of the speaker, Apple has taken a different direction to Google and Amazon and concentrated on delivering a device that is focused on simply being a speaker to play music rather than be a conduit for access to a smart assistant (in the case of Google’s home speaker) or for access to shopping on Amazon’s network (in the case of the Echo). Apple’s announcements indicate that it has become sensitive to public opinion and has responded to criticisms levelled at the lack of hardware that would support the demands of their high end user base. What did Apple Announce? New and Upgraded Hardware There are refreshes of the iMac, MacBook Pro and MacBook with a brand new iMac Pro. iMacs have upgraded displays and graphics capabilities enabling the use of VR including the availability of various VR games platforms like Steam VR. The popular 9.7" iPad Pro has been replaced with a 10.5" model with updated graphics and processing capabilities. In particular, the screen’s refresh rate has been doubled, in part to support an improved responsiveness to the Apple Pencil. HomePod The biggest announcement for new hardware was probably the HomePod, Apple’s smart speaker. Effectively, this is a speaker that can respond to voice commands through Siri. The details of this are sketchy and it would appear that you would need an Apple Device to set it up and configure it. Positioning it primarily as a speaker is a clever move on Apple’s part because it is unlikely to be able to do much more particularly effectively. Even Amazon has added a screen to its Echo device to provide enhanced capabilities. Software upgrades On the Mac, macOS will not get a major upgrade and so the next version will be called macOS High Sierra (Version 10.13). One could argue that the use of the “major” qualifier has been a somewhat arbitrary decision in the past but by not using it, customers have had their expectations set lower. Having said that, there is a significant change with this version of the operating system with the now mandatory use of the Apple File System, APFS. Already available on iOS devices from version 10.3, APFS is now available on the Mac, providing improvements in performance and security and is worth upgrading to enable. Other updates include changes in Apple Mail and new features in Safari including the much welcomed blocking of autoplaying videos and blocking of website tracking. In iOS 11, there is a new Files app that integrates iCloud and other cloud drives in one app as well as allowing access to local storage. On the iPad, there is an expanded Dock with the ability to launch 2 apps direct from the dock. Drag and drop of content has been added that allows content to be shared from one app to another open app in split view. The functionality of the iPad Pro has been updated with more seamless use of Apple Pencil and Notes. Notes can be activated from the lock screen for example, annotating screen shots. There is support for inline drawing within notes and emails. Handwriting can be searched. Another feature, previously supplied only be third party apps is the ability to “scan” documents, store and enhance them. Keyboard improvements included allowing for single hand operation by compressing the keyboard to the side and making numbers accessible from character keys by using a “flicking down” motion. iOS sees the support for augmented reality with new a new programmatic interface. This will allow developers to add this type of feature easily to their apps. Apple claims that the underlying image recognition that powers this feature is much faster than that available on Google Android and its hardware. Siri has got smarter with the ability to provide language translation. It is not clear whose underlying translation engine is being used but it appears not to be Google’s after testing a few phrases. Google dramatically improved its language translation capabilities last year and Apple will have a long way to go to catch up in this area. In maps, Apple has added indoor maps. Again, Apple has improved its maps capabilities but it lags significantly behind Google.

(AFP/Josh Edelson) Apple will later this year release a "HomePod" music-centric smart home speaker, challenging a market currently dominated by Amazon and Google in its latest move to weave deeper into people's lives. HomePod, aided by Apple's Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. "We really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said as he unveiled it. HomePod will take on lower priced Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have had momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller announces HomePod as he speaks during the opening keynote address the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center on June 5, 2017 in San Jose, California. Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the five-day WWDC that runs through June 9.( GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / AFP/Justin Sullivan) It is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company's Siri team had tuned the assistant into a "musicologist" that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the "power to rock the house," according to Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. Playing to strength HomePod capped a keynote presentation that included updates to Apple's iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs. "Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri," said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. "The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market." A prototype of Apple's new HomePod is displayed during the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center on June 5, 2017 in San Jose, California. Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the five-day WWDC with announcements of a a new operating system, a new iPad Pro and a the HomePod, a music speaker and home assistant. WWDC runs through June 9. ( GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / AFP/Justin Sullivan) Read also: Four online shopping tips for Ramadhan Some industry insiders, however, note Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Apple has given Siri new male and female voices, described as more natural and expressive, and added abilities such as translating English phrases into Chinese, French, German, Italian or Spanish. Apple said it is also using 'on-device learning' to enable Siri to take people's tastes into account. Amazon has dominated the connected speakers category since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8 percent for Google Home. Macs and iPads Cook also used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan's devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named "High Sierra" in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and "intelligent tracking prevention" that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple unveiled an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. Aimed at high-end design professionals rather than the home market, the iMac Pro is to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999.

(AFP/Josh Edelson) Mac models were also boosted to work with virtual reality gear, a move by Apple into technology that Facebook has embraced with its Oculus unit. Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its map program. And the operating system for mobile devices is getting a major update with iOS 11. Changes included making iPads more efficient and being able to send money to friends using Apple's messaging application for mobile devices. A set of iOS 11 features including enabling smartphone cameras to read QR codes are aimed at the China market, where Apple would like to bolster iPhone sales.

In addition to iOS, macOS, watchOS, app and API updates, we got new iMacs and iPads, MacBook upgrades and the HomePod speaker (covered here). Here are some key takeaways on what was announced: The High-End PC Market Still Matters a Lot to Apple For a while, it looked like Apple was treating the Mac as a legacy business, reducing the attention it was given as it directed more resources towards its mobile hardware and pitched the iPad Pro as a notebook alternative. But with PC sales and usage stabilizing even as tablet sales continue to fall, and the high-end PC market looking especially healthy, the company made it clear at WWDC that the Mac remains a priority. The new 27-inch iMac Pro is getting a lot of attention thanks to its eye-popping specs. The workstation, which starts at a steep $4,999, supports 8-to-18 core Intel (INTC)  Xeon CPUs, will feature a high-end AMD (AMD)  GPU based on the company's next-gen Vega architecture and supports up to 128GB of RAM and 4TB of flash storage. Just as notable as the specs, though, is the fact that Apple is unveiling the iMac Pro 6 months before it ships, lest customers frustrated over the fact that its predecessor (the second-gen Mac Pro) hadn't been updated since 2013. The new standard iMacs -- available in 21.5-inch and 27-inch models, and priced from $1,099 to $2,299 -- are also worthy of attention: They feature improved displays, along with CPU, GPU, memory, storage and connectivity improvements. And a 4K 21.5-inch iMac can now be had for $1,299, $200 less than before. Along the same lines, Apple is now selling a 13-inch MacBook Pro that lacks an OLED Touch Bar for $1,299, after previously setting a $1,499 start price. Both 13-inch and 15-inch Pro models were refreshed to feature CPUs based on Intel's Kaby Lake architecture, which launched last fall, as was the 12-inch MacBook. The fact Apple delivered a hardware update for MacBook Pros only launched 7 months ago says something about how much the business still matters to the company. Mac sales rose 14% annually in the March quarter, and accounted for 11% of total revenue. On the other hand, it looks like Apple is slowly killing off its relatively cheap MacBook Air, which hadn't been refreshed since March 2015. The Air, now only available in a 13-inch model, did get a minor CPU update. However, the new CPU isn't a Kaby Lake part, but based on Intel's Broadwell architecture, which launched in 2014. Apple's Strategy For Stabilizing iPad Sales Revolves Around the iPad Pro The iPad Pro has been a relative strong point for Apple as iPad sales have joined the broader tablet market's in slumping. The iPad hardware and software just shown off, together with a continued lack of updates for the 7.9-inch iPad Mini (last updated in 2015), show how much Apple's tablet business is now focused on appealing to enthusiasts, creative professionals and potential notebook switchers. As rumored, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro featuring thinner bezels (and the same form factor) than its 9.7-inch predecessor was announced, as was a refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The devices feature much-improved displays and processors (a technology called ProMotion improves the display refresh rate to 120Hz, and automatically adjusts it based on content), and double storage capacities across price tiers. The 10.5-inch model has a $649 start price, $50 more than what Apple used to charge for the 9.7-inch model. On the software side, Apple announced iPads running iOS 11 would feature an app dock that can be pulled up from any app by swiping up, and let users launch apps in standalone or split-view mode. Users can also drag and drop content between apps shown in split-view mode, and scan launched apps in a manner similar to macOS' Mission Control mode. It's all very PC-like, as is the new iOS file-browsing app Apple just announced. Convincing consumers to ditch their notebooks for iPad Pros will still often be a challenge, but Apple's sales pitch is now a little stronger. Apple is Getting Serious About Augmented Reality ARKit, a set of developer programming interfaces (APIs) arriving with iOS 11, is Apple's entry into the rapidly-expanding field of software platforms that make it possible to place (with the help of AI) relevant digital content on top of a real-world camera view. Examples shown at WWDC include throwing a ball down a street in Pokemon Go, and taking apart and assembling a Lego Batmobile. Developers will no doubt think of plenty of others. ARKit competes to a degree with Facebook's  (FB) recently-launched Camera Effects AR platform. And perhaps also the World Lenses feature recently built into Snapchat. But those platforms are respectively tied to Facebook and Snap's apps. If they succeed, that wouldn't necessarily prevent ARKit from being widely used by other developers. The ARKit launch, which comes amid reports Apple is working on AR glasses that could launch next year and plans to include a 3D-sensing front camera on the iPhone 8, might motivate Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) to rethink its Android AR strategy. The company has a powerful AR/indoor mapping platform called Tango that developers can write apps for, along with a new home-grown service called Google Lens that adds useful information and content to a camera view. But Tango requires phones with specialized hardware to work, and is thus available on only one Android phone (Lenovo's bulky Phab 2 Pro) to date. To keep pace with Apple, Google needs much broader hardware support. Though It's Not Easy, Apple is Trying Hard to Keep Pace With Google In AI As expected, Apple frequently talked up its machine learning investments during its WWDC keynote. The company discussed its use of AI to do everything from having Siri surface content and make typing suggestions based on a user's past activity, to automatically grouping photos taken at the same event, improving battery life by understanding user activity, and automatically translating voice commands. The company also unveiled Core ML, a set of APIs that will let developers use machine learning models Apple has created for tasks such as speech, vision and text analysis. It arrives less than a month after Google announced TensorFlow Lite, an open-source AI software library that can be run on mobile devices. It complements several machine learning APIs provided via the Google Cloud Platform. As the abilities of services such as Google Assistant, Lens, Translate and Photos show, Google still arguably has an AI lead against Apple and other consumer tech giants. And Apple's strategy of only running machine learning algorithms against its users' data on their devices (done for privacy reasons) could prove a handicap when it comes to optimizing its algorithms. But like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, it has clearly made AI a priority. Keeping Software and User Interfaces Simple is Still an Apple Obsession Many of iOS 11's new features are focused on making the OS more intuitive, and/or integrating different parts of it. These include the new app dock, easier iPad app switching, better integration between the notification and lock screen and the consolidation of Control Center icons (previously found on three pages) onto one page. Likewise, Apple is rolling out a Files app that provides an integrated view of a user's local and cloud-hosted files, overhauling its Photos app to automatically group images and cleaning up its App Store interface. And a new "Do Not Disturb While Driving" feature is effective at doing what its name implies. Android has made big strides in recent years in terms of becoming simpler and more intuitive, and the next version (code named Android O) should yield additional gains. But as Monday's announcements show, iOS is still unmatched in this respect. Apple's Hardware and Chip Engineering Remain Core Competitive Advantages Examples of this abounded during the WWDC keynote. They include the A10X Fusion processor powering the new iPad Pros -- they pair 3 high-performance CPU cores with 3 low-power cores and a 12-core GPU -- and the audio technologies built into the HomePod that allow it to simulate surround sound. They also include the new iPad Pros' ProMotion display tech, and the tremendous amount of processing power built into the iMac Pro's sleek form factor. Apple is still very good at using hardware and chip engineering to differentiate its products, both in terms of their practical features and raw specs. Not much more needs to be said here. AMD is Clearly in Apple's Good Graces Some of the MacBook Pro models announced last October supported AMD's mid-range Polaris GPUs. At WWDC, Apple followed that up by announcing all of its 4K and 5K iMacs will feature AMD GPUs. In addition, an AMD GPU will now come standard on the 15-inch MacBook Pro; it previously cost extra. AMD shares rose 3.1% on Monday amid the news. They're roughly flat in 2017, after having skyrocketed in 2016. Considering the extent to which Nvidia (NVDA)  has dominated the high-end GPU market, Apple's support for AMD makes for a nice vote of confidence.

Most large urban areas tend to have only one air quality monitor for every 100 to 200 square miles. In comparison, the new mobile approach maps air pollution every 100 feet, or at about four to five locations along a single city block. “Air pollution varies very finely in space, and we can’t capture that variation with other existing measurement techniques,” said lead researcher Joshua Apte of The University of Texas at Austin in the US. “Using our approach and analysis techniques, we can now visualise air pollution with incredible detail. This kind of information could transform our understanding of the sources and impacts of air pollution,” Apte added. The research was conducted in partnership with the US-based non-profit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Google and Aclima, a California-based provider of environmental sensors. By integrating Aclima’s sensor system into Google Street View cars, the team mapped air pollution in 78 square miles of Oakland, California, over an entire year, collecting one of the largest datasets of air pollution ever measured of single city streets. This new technique maps urban air pollution at 100,000 times greater spatial resolution than is possible with traditional government air quality monitors, according to a study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The team believes that their hyper-local mobile measurement system could be implemented in many cities throughout the world, providing detailed air quality information for citizens, families, local governments and scientists. The new technique could address major air quality monitoring gaps worldwide and has the potential to transform the way air pollution is monitored in urban areas as well as shed light on the health effects on city dwellers. “You could use this information when you’re picking a school for your kids. Is there a school with a playground that might have better air quality because your kid has asthma,” Apte said. “This hyper-local information about consistent air quality can be really useful for people, especially those who are vulnerable because of age or health condition,” Apte noted.

(REUTERS) Siri is getting a new voice, and the Mac is getting a new name. Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. New iMacs for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality experiences. Here are the highlights: Siri-powered speaker An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. A prototype Apple HomePod is seen during the annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017. (REUTERS) Apple says it’s giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple’s Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. A new, smarter Siri With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and centre. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. About your privacy Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker’s always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple’s servers until you say, “Hey, Siri.” The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon’s Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won’t know who you are - it’ll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. A different reality Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come “as the technology hits an inflection point.” A prototype Apple iMac Pro is seen during the annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, June 5, 2017. (REUTERS) Apple’s new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change that. New hardware Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. Updates for the iPhone and iPad With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new “do not disturb” mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. more from tech Lyft to bring autonomous rides to Boston with partnership Jun 06, 2017 19:19 IST In Pics: Apple’s 5 big announcements at WWDC Jun 06, 2017 12:38 IST New Horizons, New Courses Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

(AP) Apple on Monday unveiled its ‘HomePod’ speaker as it moved to challenge Amazon Alexa and Google Home as a smart home and music hub. HomePod, powered by Apple’s Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 (approximately Rs 22, 454) when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual developers conference. “It’s so cool, we really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said of the new device. HomePod will taking Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have been building momentum in the market for voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the Siri team at Apple had tuned the assistant into a “musicologist” that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the “power to rock the house,” according to Schiller, who said the team worked to make HomePod an potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. Playing to strength HomePod capped a keynote presentation at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference that included updates to its iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs available on HomePod. “Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. “The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market so far.” Some industry insiders, however, note that Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Amazon has dominated the category of connected speakers since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods or rides and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8% for Google Home and 5.6% for others including Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. Macs and iPads Cook used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan’s devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named “High Sierra” in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and “intelligent tracking prevention” that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple provided look at an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. The iMac Pro was to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999 (approximately Rs 3,21,621). Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its mapping program. Apple also released a software kit so developers could infuse augmented reality into applications for iPhones or iPads. Given the hundreds of millions of Apple mobile devices in use, that will create the largest augmented reality platform in the world “overnight,” executives said. more from tech Lyft to bring autonomous rides to Boston with partnership Jun 06, 2017 19:19 IST In Pics: Apple’s 5 big announcements at WWDC Jun 06, 2017 12:38 IST New Horizons, New Courses Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Boolean Corporation the trick is to plug your iPhotos Library to the desktop uploader and see the magic happen. I have my Canon and SONY photos up there as well. ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before... After half a year with this career and therefore i obtained cash in sum Thirty six Thousand us dollars... Ordinarily I make up approximate to eighty bucks/h and work for three to four hours every single day.And excellent point about this task is the fact that you can supervise time and effort whenever you work and for just how long as you may like and you attain a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too vidvox That was the craziest thing about using my DSLR on a trip through Texas last year, looking at the photos online and seeing the correct GPS location on them! Tyler Humphreys My mom had some pictures of Siberia, California and Google Photos thought they were from Russia, just from an album named "Siberia". chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google Rob 54,857..... Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit. I feel like this would be a different story if I had something like the Pixel or Nexus 6P, or even the Nexus 5X instead. LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Jerry Suppan Wow!　And I thought I had too many at 51,000+. Well, I guess we can store our entire life from birth if if we include pre-digital era scanned photos. (^J^) Đức Thành That is a creepy thought but somehow I find it kind of exciting as well. Imagine storing all of our memories, thoughts and emotions on the cloud. Victor A backup of met-art archives? 😁 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Luqmaan Mathee "To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below." It's in the article. Teja Oops, missed that.

Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999.

Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson.

Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file.

I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote.

I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client.

Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over. Let it back them up while you're out and about. myssi Wondering how much it costs to Google to save all these bazillions of photos; that too for an app which earns $0. Leroy Filon 132.068 photos.

Rosh Mathew This is for people who have 40,000 photos synced. Do you ever get the feeling that - OK IM KINDA GETTING TIRED OF SNAPPING AWAY DURING A VACATION THAN ACTUALLY ENJOYING the moment? Years later, that foggy feeling that I spent so much time taking photos that I don't remember the vacation at all? And when you do have some time to sit down and reminisce, going through thousands of snaps feels exhausting, and there is too much emphasis on quantity of snaps than QUALITY? (I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

Apple has finally revealed its long-awaited Siri-connected speaker at this year's WWDC, a direct rival to the likes of the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The cylindrical speaker, known as the 'HomePod', resembles the Mac Pro at 7in tall and promises to "reinvent music in the home". From initial images it appears the HomePod will be available in white or dark grey. Its biggest selling point comes from its 'Spatial Awareness' feature, technology that allows the device to automatically detect the space around it, adjusting the audio to best match its surroundings. Demoed live on stage at the San Jose event on Monday, the HomePod showed off some pretty impressive auto-adjustment that meant sound was directed into open spaces rather than against nearby walls. Apple also states that two HomePods will work in tandem to help create richer sounds. Powered by an A8 chip, the device also boasts echo cancellation technology and real time acoustic and bass modelling. It is also designed to work with Apple Music subscriptions, able to access your music library and make recommendations based on song history. Yet Apple wants to directly compete against the likes of Amazon's Echo and the Google Home, and has built its smart assistant Siri into the speaker. Through six microphones fitted around the edges of the device, users are able to not only control music through voice commands, but also use Siri to access services like news, weather, translation apps, and reminders. It is also compatible with Apple's HomeKit, allowing users to control connected home devices with speech. "HomePod packs powerful speaker technology, Siri intelligence and wireless access to the entire Apple Music library into a beautiful speaker that is less than 7 inches tall, can rock most any room with distortion-free music and be a helpful assistant around your home," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior VP of worldwide marketing. HomePod will be initially available in the US, UK and Australia this December. It will be priced at $349 in the US, with local pricing announced later in the year.

Photo: The New York Times mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:55 AM, June 6, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO — Apple entered the growing field of voice-controlled speakers for the home on Monday (June 5), taking on early leaders Amazon.com and Google. Apple’s speaker, called HomePod, emphasises the enjoyment of music and looks like a wide can with curved edges. Unlike Amazon’s new Echo Show, Apple’s device does not have a screen. It will allow users to talk to Siri, Apple’s digital assistant, while at home and costs US$349 (S$ 481) — almost double the price of most competing products. HomePod is Apple’s first major new hardware product since the Apple Watch’s release in 2015, and it comes at an important time for the company. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is seeking new revenue streams after becoming heavily reliant on the success of the iPhone. The market for internet-connected speakers and other smart home technology may be big enough to help Apple diversify. Shipments of intelligent home speakers surged nearly 600 per cent year-over-year to 4.2 million units in the fourth quarter, with Amazon taking about 88 per cent share and Google 10 percent, according to consultant Strategy Analytics. Spending on smart home related hardware, services and installation fees will reach US$155 billion by 2022, up from almost US$90 billion this year, with devices accounting for about half of that, the consulting firm also estimates. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has stressed the importance of Apple’s services business, predicting it will double in size by 2021. The new speaker establishes a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into these services. It also combats the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: Those don’t support Apple services like Apple Music, which brings in US$10 in revenue per user each month. Without an Apple speaker, consumers seeking smart home devices may opt both for competing hardware and services like Amazon Prime and Google Play Music. The product was introduced on stage by Apple executive Phil Schiller, who said it works closely with the company’s Music app and will ship in December in the US, UK and Australia. The Siri digital assistant has been updated to understand more spoken requests focused on music, he added. The device has already entered production, Bloomberg reported last month. It has been tested by some Apple employees in their homes for upwards of a year, according to people familiar with the matter. During this week’s conference, Apple also discussed significant software upgrades for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch and debuted new iPad and Mac computer models.

FBI Director James Comey testifies on Trump, Russia talks More | Dismiss Online Terrorist Propaganda Still a Challenge for Tech Companies ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Online Terrorist Propaganda Still a Challenge for Tech Companies By Jack Nicas, Sam Schechner and Deepa Seetharaman Published June 05, 2017 Features Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Terrorists are still successfully using the internet to communicate with and recruit followers, despite progress by big tech companies in cracking down on the activity in recent years. Continue Reading Below Online terrorist propaganda is attracting fresh criticism in the wake of Saturday's deadly terror attack in London. Prime Minister Theresa May and others have singled out Silicon Valley for criticism, saying Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others need to do a better job policing content. It is unclear if the U.K. government has determined any link between online extremist content and the attack. The challenge for tech companies is daunting: A stream of social-media accounts, web videos and blog pages are constantly popping up and spewing questionable content, while new accounts and sites are replacing deleted ones by the hour, researchers say. Much of the activity, like radical sermons or videos that use coded language, falls in a gray area that makes it difficult to track or is possibly protected by the companies' aim to protect free speech. As Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube have improved in removing explicit terrorist content, much of that material has migrated to lesser-known platforms like chat app Telegram and text-sharing site PasteBin. Terrorists still use the major platforms -- because that is where users are -- but mainly to identify potential recruits and make contact, before moving conversations toward radicalization on encrypted messaging services, researchers say. "You get the sense that no matter how much [tech companies] speed up, the perception remains that they're not doing enough," said Indiana University law professor David Fidler, who has met with tech and government officials about terrorism. "I actually have a lot of sympathy for the social media companies." PasteBin didn't respond to a request for comment. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Tech firms' response to questionable content is largely to remove it retroactively after it has been flagged by users. So hundreds, if not thousands, of people could see the content before it gets pulled, researchers say. A 26-second YouTube video explaining how to carry out a truck attack was viewed more than 360 times by Monday evening since it was posted Sunday. The video suggested using a "double-wheeled, load-bearing truck" to attack "large outdoor festivals, conventions, celebrations and parades," among other targets. The video was unlisted, meaning viewers could only find it if given a link to it, suggesting it was shared among viewers. Rick Eaton, a researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which tracks hateful online content, said on Monday that he flagged it to YouTube twice. The video was pulled minutes after The Wall Street Journal asked YouTube about it around 6:15 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. YouTube said it bars videos that aim to recruit terrorists or incite violence, and that it acts quickly to remove content flagged for violating those policies. The company said it also terminates accounts run by terrorist organizations and is committed "to tackle these complex problems and to see what more we can do to ensure that we're part of the solution." Twitter said it is expanding its use of technology to combat terrorist content. From July through December last year, Twitter said internal technology flagged 74% of the 376,890 accounts it suspended for promoting terrorism. Facebook has created a team dedicated to removing terrorist content and has been promoting "counter speech," or posts that aim to discredit militant groups like Islamic State. Facebook said that program has grown over the past year and that it wants to be a "hostile environment for terrorists." Telegram's founder and chief executive, Pavel Durov, said in Telegram messages Monday that his service is "constantly increasing the number of moderators to deal with these threats." He said every channel related to the terrorist group Islamic State is taken down within 24 hours of being reported. It isn't clear if the three London Bridge attackers were radicalized online or used encrypted apps to communicate. The BBC reported Monday that one of the men involved had followed a radical Islamic preacher on the internet, citing a former friend of the man. The preacher, Ahmad Musa Jibril, is described by counterterrorism experts as a radical cheerleader who encourages people to take action without explicitly exhorting violent jihad. A 2014 study by the U.K.-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation said 60% of foreign fighters they tracked in Syria followed him on Twitter. Mr. Jibril couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Jibril has accounts on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, with a combined 306,000 followers -- though they haven't posted since 2014 -- and his 130 YouTube videos have amassed more than 1.5 million views. YouTube said its review of Mr. Jibril's videos found they don't violate its policies because the videos discuss general Islamic themes -- such as fasting, interpretations of the Quran, and the use of Western medicine -- and don't advocate violence. To be sure, propaganda videos -- regardless of platform -- are usually just the tip of the iceberg. Experts say that extremely few radicals take action solely on the basis of social media consumption. Instead, potential recruits generally move eventually into peer-to-peer communication with a handler either online or offline or both. "Social media increases exposure so more people are exposed," said Peter Weinberger, a senior researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. "But it is very rarely the case that someone will just view content online and take action by themselves." --Stu Woo contributed to this article.

Cook promised updates to each of Apple's operating systems - for the Apple TV, the Apple Watch, mobile devices and computers - plus some additional announcements that he promises will be "major." Here's what we found out about each of them: 1) Apple's home hub is here. The HomePod is Apple's smart speaker - the answer to Google Home and Amazon's Echo line. The speaker will respond to voice commands using Apple's voice assistant, Siri, and is closely integrated with Apple's Music services. The speaker will also be able to sense the size of the room using acoustics. It will also work with Apple services such as Messages and its smart home appliance platform, HomeKit. And just like its competitors, the HomePod will provide information on news, general knowledge, weather and sports scores. While its features appear very similar to what's available on the Echo or Google Home, Apple said that its distinguishing feature is sound quality. The HomePod is designed with privacy in mind, said Phil Schiller, Apple's head of worldwide marketing. All communications are encrypted. The HomePod will cost $349 - more expensive than Google's and Amazon's smart speakers - and will start shipping in December. 2) Amazon is coming to Apple TV. It's a been a long road for Apple TV customers who like to watch Amazon Video. A feud between the two companies has kept Amazon's library off the Apple set-top box. But the firms appear to have buried the hatchet a little. That's good for consumers, who have been caught in the middle of a battle between two titans that has made the streaming world needlessly complicated. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) 3) Apple Watch is getting an update. Siri is getting smarter on the Apple Watch, with a new watch face that uses the assistant to set up a feed of your day on your wrist. The watch face, which seems like a mash-up between Google Now and your Facebook feed, will show you photos of old memories from previous years and make recommendations. For example, if you're close to hitting your activity goals for the day, the watch face will tell you exactly what you need to do to achieve your goals. The workout app is also getting an update, with features that give users more automatic measurements and track multiple workouts in a single session. Apple Music is also going to be more closely integrated with the watch, with automatic syncing for playlists. The developer preview is open now and will roll out to all customers this fall. 4) Apple's reveals new Mac operating system - High Sierra - and Macs get a refresh. Apple's next operating system is called High Sierra and will be a free update to the current Sierra system. Mac lineup: Apple also announced a slew of updates to the Mac lineup, which has been overdue for an update. The new desktops now have higher memory capacity and stronger graphics performance. The 21.5-inch iMac starts at $1,099; a 21.5-inch, 4K-capable iMac Retina will cost $1,299; and a 25-inch iMac Retina 5K goes for $1,799. Notebooks: Apple said it's refreshing its notebooks, with the MacBook and MacBook Pro moving to faster processors and faster solid-state hard drives. The 15" MacBook Pro is also getting faster graphics. Apple is also cutting the basic price for the MacBook's 13-inch model by $300. All are shipping now. Desktop: Apple also announced a new iMac Pro, which will cost $4,999 and will be available in December. Apple is clearly trying to position its desktop and laptop computers to appeal more to creative professionals, including game developers. Apple officials talked a lot about support for virtual reality, something it hasn't spoken that much about before. 5) iOS 11 gets some redesigns. Control center: Apple is revamping the control center on iOS - the panel that pops up to let you control volume, brightness, etc. - by enlarging it and spacing out some of the functions. Apple Pay: The company also introduced a person-to-person payment feature to Apple Pay. For example, a message that says "You owe me $20" will automatically pull up a suggestion to tap into Apple Pay, which will suggest $20 as your basic payment. Voice assistant: Siri will speak (a little) more naturally in female and male voices and use some sort of machine learning to suggest apps that you may want to use. GPS: Maps has a couple of updates, including indoor maps for places such as shopping malls - a cultural icon that's apparently dying, but, hey, at least it's a start. The Maps app will now display the speed limit of the road you're driving on and let you know what lane you should be in. Using Bluetooth and WiFi, it will also be able to track when you're moving in a car and give you the option to turn on a "do not disturb" mode while driving. Those who send you a message will now see an automatic reply that you're driving, and you will see their message later. If they reply "urgent" to that message, that message will be marked as such and go through. App Store: The store is getting a makeover, too, with tabs for games, apps that are notable that day, and a tab just for nongaming apps. AR: Apple is also bringing more machine learning and augmented reality capabilities to the iPhone, which will help developers create apps with these features. In a keynote demo, Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, placed a digital cup, vase and lamp on a table and showed how the objects' shadows were able to interact with each other. A representative from Wingnut AR, a studio owned by "Lord of the Rings" director Peter Jackson, demoed a more elaborate AR battle onstage. These new capabilities, Federighi said, make iOS the largest AR platform in the world. 6) New iPad Pro models and new productivity features Apple has updated its iPad Pro line, upping the basic screen size of the higher-end tablet to 10.5 inches, rather than the 9.7-inch screen that has been the basic iPad's screen size since it was introduced. The 10.5-inch model will start at $649, with the bigger 12.9-inch model starting at $799. Apple is also doubling the storage space on these models, and the larger model will have a version with 512 GB of storage. Users will be able to order the tablets now; they ship next week. The iPad Pro also gains some productivity features for iOS 11, which more closely mimics the Mac. Users will be able to easily multitask, drag and drop images between apps and put far more Mac-like features at users' fingertips. Apple has also bumped up the features on the Pencil stylus, and the iPad Pro should now be able to read your handwriting. ---     Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count...

Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM news.com.au June 6, 20172:46pm A prototype of Apple's new HomePod is displayed during the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center on June 5, 2017. Picture: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images IT’S the company’s first completely new kind of product in more than two years but that doesn’t mean it’s original. Apple unveiled its new home speaker at its annual developers’ conference overnight confirming expectations that it would follow rivals Amazon and Google into the smart home speaker market. The speakers are imbued with a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning and are designed to respond to requests and answer questions for you while being the focal point of your connected living room. Amazon debuted its Echo home speaker in 2014, while Google followed with its Google Home version in 2016. But just because Apple is late to join to emerging market — with a more expensive offering — doesn’t mean the company can’t win the battle. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren’t themselves firsts. The iPod wasn’t the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listened to music. By US pricing, the Amazon Echo costs $US180 (about $A250 plus postage) while the Google Home sells for $US129 (likely around $A199 when Australian pricing is announced). Apple’s Siri-powered HomePod speaker will debut in Australia in December and comes with a price tag of $US349, so it could be around $450 in Australian stores. It costs significantly more, but Apple is promising a product that could justify the price. New Apple HomePod smart speaker on display. Picture: Josh EdelsonSource:AFP SOUND The HomePod speaker is similar to its competitors though Apple says it’s giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. After all, it is a speaker. With a seven-tweeter array and a four-inch subwoofer, the HomePod should deliver substantially better sound that its rivals. Apple says it has engineered the speaker with “spatial awareness” so it can automatically adjust its acoustics to suit the room — a seriously cool feature if it turns out to be effective. You can also link the device with other HomePods or speakers in the house that are AirPlay 2-compatible to get surround sound. “Just like with portable music, we want to reinvent home music,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the conference. Unsurprisingly there’s integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Google Home: $129 Amazon Echo: $179 Apple HomePod: $349 That Pod better deliver some amazing sound, because Siri is not going to do it.— Jelle Prins (@jelleprins) June 5, 2017 Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller speaks during the opening keynote address the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference. Picture: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesSource:AFP PRIVACY Besides playing music, HomePod will help people manage their lives and homes. Theoretically, Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It is only listening when you prompt it awake by saying: “Hey Siri” and a light will appear on top of the speaker. When you do that, it records it, encrypts it and sends it anonymously to the cloud so you’re not identified. Apple, which has been a staunch supporter of encryption, has clearly gone out of its way to mitigate concerns over privacy. “Our team cares deeply about your privacy,” Apple senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller said. “It has that magic phrase, ‘Hey Siri.’ Until you say it, nothing’s being sent to Apple.” When Amazon’s Echo debuted it was met with trepidation by privacy advocates over concerns Amazon was storing all the conversations customers were having with the device. Currently data stored on Amazon’s servers is not anonymised. One of the fundamental differences between the big companies is if they care about privacy. Apple: Yes. Google, FB: No.— Nicholas Thompson (@nxthompson) June 5, 2017 THE APPLE FACTOR Apple has a history of making products slightly more luxurious that work well with each other. The company’s game plan has always been to lure you into their closed ecosystem and with a product designed to sit at the centre of other connected devices, this could pay dividends. According to US market research firm eMarketer, more than 35 million people in the US — where the home speaker market has really emerged — are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year. That is more than double the previous year. It’s clearly a growing market, and one that Apple is primed to capture. Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the five-day WWDC with announcements of a new operating system, a new iPad Pro and a the HomePod, a music speaker and home assistant.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Chrome 59 arrives with native notifications on macOS, settings in Material Design, and Image Capture API Emil Protalinski@EPro June 5, 2017 6:45 PM Google has launched Chrome 59 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Among the additions are native notifications on macOS, settings being revamped to follow Material Design, the Image Capture API, Headless Chrome, and more service worker improvements. You can update to the latest version now using the browser’s built-in silent updater or download it directly from google.com/chrome. Chrome is arguably more than a browser: With over 1 billion users, it’s a major platform that web developers have to consider. In fact, with Chrome’s regular additions and changes, developers have to keep up to ensure they are taking advantage of everything available. Chrome 59 supports the macOS notification system. This means that when developers send notifications via the Notifications API or chrome.notifications, they will be shown directly by the macOS native notification system. Some low-usage API features are now discouraged since they result in a degraded experience on macOS, so if you build apps and sites with notifications you may want to check out the migration guide. Next up, Chrome’s settings page has been updated to follow Google’s Material Design language. This is purely a cosmetic change, but nevertheless the browser now looks more like the rest of Google’s apps and services. The Image Capture API allows vsites to take higher resolution images than before. That means developers get full control over camera settings such as zoom, ISO, and white balance. Headless Chrome allows running Chrome in an automated environment without a user interface or peripherals. This is great for such use cases as automating unit tests with Selenium and converting a web page into a PDF. Lastly, the Navigation Preload API lets the browser preload navigation requests while a service worker is starting up. These requests are started before executing the fetch event handler in the service worker intercepting the target URL, giving the worker access to the preload response inside the fetch event handler and allowing it to handle the navigation with minimal delay. Other developer features in this release include: Developers can now use MediaError.message to obtain greater detail about a MediaError produced by <audio> or <video>. WritableStreams are now available as part of the vStreams API for processing streams of data, while providing a standard abstraction for writing streaming data to a sink with built-in vbackpressure and queuing. The vStreams API has been expanded with the ability to pipe between ReadableStreams and WritableStreams via the pipeTo() and pipeThrough() methods, allowing easier consumption of streaming data. Developers can now use the vgetInstalledRelatedApps function to smartly consolidate push notifications between related web and native apps by suggesting when and on which platform to offer them. To provide enhanced privacy, CSS stylesheets can now specify their own vreferrer policy via the HTTP header, rather than always inheriting the referrer policy of the document that originally referenced it. To avoid over-prompting users, Chrome will now vtemporarily stop an origin from requesting a permission following the third dismissal of that permission request. vTouch events are now aligned to requestAnimationFrame, ensuring that input is processed as part of the document lifecycle and creating a more efficient and adaptive input response. The new worker-src Content Security Policy directive restricts which URLs may be loaded as a Worker, SharedWorker, or ServiceWorker. If you prefer a visual rundown, here’s the video version (note that there are also features specific to Chrome 59 for Android, which isn’t out just yet): Chrome 59 also implements 30 security fixes. The following ones were found by external researchers: [$7500][722756] High CVE-2017-5070: Type confusion in V8.

Reported by Khalil Zhani on 2017-04-24 [$N/A][692378] Low CVE-2017-5085: Inappropriate javascript execution on WebUI pages. Reported by Zhiyang Zeng of Tencent security platform department on 2017-02-15 [729639] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives Google thus spent at least $23,500 in bug bounties for this release. As always, the security fixes alone should be enough incentive for you to upgrade. Google releases a new version of its browser every six weeks or so. Chrome 60 will arrive by mid-July. Update on June 7: Chrome 59 for Android is out today; it is rolling out slowly on Google Play. The changelog states the updated JavaScript engine loads pages faster and uses less memory.

[Update: Fixed] It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 12:04pm PDTJun 5, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares53 Google Google Home News Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google has updated the thread to say all issues have been addressed. If you still have problems, try restarting.

That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All of them. ericshmerick How's the sodium level of that snack? Salty? Salty. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Spencer I've been having the same issue. I'm considering switching it from my 5Ghz network to my 2.4Ghz just to see if that makes a difference... Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime. Curtis Bond So this is what worked for me. Every time I used the hot-phrase it would spit out the same error, but once my wife used the hot-phrase, it started working perfectly. After that neither of us had issues. I'm pretty sure it's a software problem that's related to voice recognition. Also, big ups to AP for posting this. If Google is going to be serious about consumer electronics, they've got to stay on top of nonsense like this. A widespread failure like this should be unacceptable, and frankly should have been fixed already. Kyle Kepner I have five Google homes and 3 of them are wonky right now. Resets did not help ericshmerick Resetting will do nothing. It's a problem with ~the cloud~ LondonLeedsFan Is this feature available in the UK? Bruce Wayne And we want to trust these people to drive our cars autonomously. LOL. YuCMi Wouldn't it just chill your spine to hear your car saying, "Hmmm, something went wrong," while on a busy expressway? Đức Thành If you ever consider writing a script for a horror movie, please know that I'd like to read it and direct its movie. Just saying. YaKillaCJ I would rather have Wayne Tech JD Seeing as how they had Real life RC-able atomic powered cars in 1966 and a fully automatic self driving voice controlled car by 1989 I approve. DJ JoJo I was able to get mine working by going into home app, clicking upper right devices button. Next to Google home pic was "ready for multi user" prompt. I clicked it and trained my voice and it's working with no problems now. I had already power cycled and rebooted but that didn't work until I clicked on prompt. Defenestratus it didn't work for me for literally 3 minutes. Then it worked again. abc To be fair, it's a beta product. Bugs can happen. :) SunnyStroker Yep, that's Google! Always half Baked, always in Beta. Daniel Including Android right? I think we can cut them some slack considering how many things they give us for free. JD Its not free You are the product #productception KSubedi Almost returned mine because of that because I thought mine was defective unit. drkarlp I had mine for 9 months....I think it happened once - I re booted and all was fine. I love Google Home ! ericshmerick Wow...a positive poster. Everything okay? Garrett Johnson Fun fact. Holding the Microphone off button for 15 will do a factory data reset. According to Google's help center page you can not do a FDR from the app. Only reboot. That being said it didn't fix it for me Lars Jeppesen No issues on my GHomes located in Denmark and Brazil. Maybe a US only thing? John "OK Google, add HomePod to my shopping list." "Umm, something went wrong." ericshmerick All 3 of mine have been instantly throwing an error when I say "Hey Google." Been going on for a few days. Maddening. Markg55 All fixed. That was quick. JD My echo is working just fine thx JD Must have something to do with the prep for their Canadian launch... #blamecanada Frawlz Mine is still bugging out.

Business Home LBoard Idris Jala, MACC at Menara Felda to gather info on FGV Bernama Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Apple ‘HomePod’ speaker to take on Amazon, Google AFP | June 6, 2017 HomePod will take on lower priced Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have had momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. SAN JOSE: Apple will later this year release a “HomePod” music-centric smart home speaker, challenging a market currently dominated by Amazon and Google in its latest move to weave deeper into people’s lives. HomePod, aided by Apple’s Siri digital assistant, will be priced at US$349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. “We really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said as he unveiled it. HomePod will take on lower priced Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have had momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. It is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company’s Siri team had tuned the assistant into a “musicologist” that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the “power to rock the house,” according to Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. Playing to strength HomePod capped a keynote presentation that included updates to Apple’s iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs. “Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. “The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market.” Some industry insiders, however, note Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Apple has given Siri new male and female voices, described as more natural and expressive, and added abilities such as translating English phrases into Chinese, French, German, Italian or Spanish. Apple said it is also using ‘on-device learning’ to enable Siri to take people’s tastes into account. Amazon has dominated the connected speakers category since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8 percent for Google Home. Macs and iPads Cook also used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan’s devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named “High Sierra” in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and “intelligent tracking prevention” that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple unveiled an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. Aimed at high-end design professionals rather than the home market, the iMac Pro is to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999. Mac models were also boosted to work with virtual reality gear, a move by Apple into technology that Facebook has embraced with its Oculus unit. Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its map program. And the operating system for mobile devices is getting a major update with iOS 11. Changes included making iPads more efficient and being able to send money to friends using Apple’s messaging application for mobile devices. A set of iOS 11 features including enabling smartphone cameras to read QR codes are aimed at the China market, where Apple would like to bolster iPhone sales.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology Why Apple is struggling to become an artificial intelligence powerhouse Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, speaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif., Monday, June 5.  Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, speaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif., Monday, June 5.  (Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP) Elizabeth DwoskinThe Washington Post In 2011, Apple became the first company to place artificial intelligence in the pockets of millions of consumers when the firm's co-founder Steve Jobs launched the voice assistant Siri on the iPhone. Eight years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial intelligence products is as fundamental to the company's next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone in sleekly-designed hardware and services. AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple's rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn't profile consumers. Moreover, Apple's longstanding penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country's top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. "Artificial intelligence is not in Apple's DNA," said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Steve Munster. "They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot." At Apple's annual developer's conference on Monday — the same event where Jobs introduced Siri — the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new standalone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri's chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. "Machine learning" — an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultra-fast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling — was repeated throughout the 2.5 hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute — or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company's Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, HomePod. She will automatically organize your photos into albums, like "2nd Anniversary," without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software toolkit, CoreML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It's six times faster than Google's rival AI processor, an executive quipped). But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence, ranging from software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully-functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind — and where the effort cuts against the core aspects of the company's secretive culture. "This is a substantial shift for Apple," said Daniel Gross, a former executive who focused on artificial intelligence. "The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers." Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company's revenues, which were $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company's iconic smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones is finally saturated. "The difference between last year's iPhone and this year's iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. ... So that s-curve is starting to flatten out," said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. "Then you have the next transformative technology, that isn't here yet." Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple's launch of HomePod, which will go for sale for $349 later this year, comes several years after Amazon and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers' spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday's updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified web search that could tell the occasional pre-programmed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as "deep" or "unsupervised" learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain's neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protege of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world's top researcher in this area. Like Salakhutdinov, who divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple, Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products, but becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. "You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do," Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper in artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a prestigious computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was "off the scale" in terms of secrecy, and that such secrecy was keeping them out of loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino giant was "making some changes." "But it's going to take some work," he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates — Google, Facebook, and Amazon were by far the top picks — but that the company was moving up in the rankings. Apple's forays into AI have also been slower than its peers because it's been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy when it did so. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer's conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people's speech in order to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations, and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise — or bad information — into good data in order to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn't know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple's focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. "Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science, and doing so to try and preserve your privacy," he said. "I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving." Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. "The bad news is that Apple is behind," he said. "The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it's still early days — there is plenty of time to catch up." Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Apple Inc.

GettyEric Thayer By Eric Limer Jun 6, 2017 Apple kicks off WWDC conference with Monday keynote. HomePod is Apple's new $350 smart speaker. MacOS High Sierra coming free this fall with under-the-hood tweaks for faster performance. An iMac Pro is coming in December for $5,000. IOS 11 gives Siri a voice update and translation powers, and comes with a redesigned App Store. There's a new iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch screen. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Apple just finished the keynote for its Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC). The presentation covered all the WWDC mainstays — a new version of macOS and a new version of iOS, both arriving in the fall — as well as a handful of hardware odds and ends, and the long-rumored Siri-powered speaker. HomePod The biggest announcement of WWDC this year is Apple's long-rumored smart speaker, officially dubbed the "HomePod": At just under 7 inches high and powered by Apple's A8 chip that you will also find in iPhones, HomePod is a speaker that uses sensing technology in an attempt to offer fuller, spacious sound. Multiple HomePods can also be networked together for especially large rooms. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As expected, the HomePod can react to voice commands with the help of Siri, much like competing smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Although while the Echo and the Home bill themselves as voice assistants first and speakers second, it looks like Apple is positioning HomePod as a speaker first, with assistant features as an added bonus. Through voice commands, the HomePod looks to be able to handle general question answering, calendar adjustment, and timer setting just like a Google Home or regular old Siri can. The details of how far it can go are still fuzzy for the time being. The HomePad can also interact with smart appliances that work with HomeKit. Example commands include: The HomePod comes in white and gray, and starts shipping this December for $350. By comparison, you can buy a Google Home for $110 or an Amazon Echo for $180. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below macOS The newest version of macOS, dubbed High Sierra, is what Apple is billing as a refined version of regular old Sierra, which came before. The new version of Safari included in High Sierra can automatically block auto-playing video and will also use machine learning in an attempt to minimize the amount of ad-tracking information shared between sites. The Photos app in High Sierra also packs a few new tricks, including machine-learning-powered facial recognition, much like what Google announced in Google Photos two years ago. High Sierra will also introduce a new, default file system. It's an under-the-hood tweak, but one that Apple promises will be able to speed up processes like moving or duplicating files even with the same computing horsepower. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below High Sierra will be out as a free update this fall. New Macs The newest line of iMacs come with the latest Intel Kaby Lake chips, which will give them a boost in both compute power and graphics capability. They also come with Thunderbolt-capable USB Type-C ports, which brings us one step closer to using the same type of cable for pretty much anything, though Apple's iPhones still use the proprietary Lightning Port. Apple also teased a new "iMac Pro" that will release in December with up to an 18-core Xeon Processor, AMD's new Radeon Vega graphics, and up to 16 gigabytes of video RAM. Oh yeah, and it comes in Space Grey. This kind of power isn't aimed at the average Joe, but instead aimed directly at professionals that do a lot of video editing or other horsepower heavy jobs, so all that will cost you a hefty $5,000 on the low end. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Apple's MacBooks are also being updated with Intel's new chips but no other design modifications. You'll notice that the MacBook Air is pointedly absent: iOS 11 In iOS 11, Apple Pay will be able let you send or receive money to and from people, effectively putting a built-in version of Venmo right inside iOS. So long as the people you hang with are all on iPhones. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Siri is also getting some updates. Thanks to machine learning, she'll now have a more natural-sounding voice with more options for emphasis than before. Siri will also be able to give you translation if you ask her how to say something in say, Chinese, although this will only be a beta feature in iOS 11. The control panel is also getting a brand new look that packs a bunch more functionality into a small space: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below IOS 11 also includes a suite of features aimed mostly at iPad Pro users. The new "Files" app functions basically as a traditional computer file system for the iPad Pro but also includes files from third-party cloud storage services like Dropbox. IOS 11 on the iPad Pro also supports drag and drop, which lets you drag apps around your screen much the same way you can have multiple windows open on the same desktop. Apple is clearly making a push to use iOS 11 to make the iPad Pro a more suitable replacement for your average laptop. The new iOS 11 is available as a beta for developers now, an open beta later this summer, and a free update this fall. A New iPad Pro There's a new version of the smaller iPad Pro, with its screen scaled up to 10.5 inches from 9.7 thanks in large part to some shrinking down around the bezels. This modest bump in size is just enough for the new iPad Pro to be able to have a full-size on-screen keyboard and use a full-size keyboard cover. Apple also doubled the refresh rate of the screen on the iPad Pro, effectively increasing the speed at which the screen can update itself. That'll make motion on it look extra smooth (if the app can support it and your eyes can tell the difference) and also let it work with the Apple Pencil without as much update lag. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The new iPad Pro is available now and starts shipping next week: Other Odds and Ends Amazon is coming to Apple TV with Amazon Prime video. The streaming juggernaut has been a hold-out when it comes to streaming devices made by its tech-space competitors. You still can't stream Amazon Prime to a Google Chromecast, but coming to Apple TV means that either Amazon is coming out of its shell or Apple made a heck of a deal to get the important streaming service on its box. Apple isn't rolling out any crazy augmented reality glasses yet, but with the new "ARKit," Apple is takings its first earnest steps into the space. The developer kit demonstrated on stage was able to pull off the the same sort of tricks the Facebook and Snapchat have been able to with a similar "look through your phone" approach, nothing particularly groundbreaking. But since there are so many iPhones out in the wild, Apple's shot at this tech doesn't have to be especially good — it has a huge leg up by virtue of existing at all.

[Update: Fixed] It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 12:04pm PDTJun 5, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares53 Google Google Home News Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google has updated the thread to say all issues have been addressed. If you still have problems, try restarting.

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior. Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from ease and comfort of my property or home, with simplistic gigs that solely demands from you a Laptop or desktop pc as well as online connection and I am just more successful than before... After six months time during this task and therefore i obtained remunerated totally 36 thousand usd... Mainly I acquire just about eighty bucks/hr and also work for 3 to 4 hours on a regular basis.And wonderful thing relating to this job is usually that you can organize time period when you do the job and for how much time as you prefer and you attain a paycheck a week.----->>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm glad I got an Echo instead of that air freshener. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e084adc03d0c0fe4e62615255f95376c0df7f936c6bd8c9b188e814dfa71c29.gif Luckbuckets I wanted to disagree with your choice of the echo but that gif. but the snark over the top. awesome. Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. abc A comment with 13 upvotes ranks lower than the top comment which has only 4 upvotes. One can imagine how many butthurt Google fanboys must have downvoted this comment. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All of them. ericshmerick How's the sodium level of that snack? Salty? Salty. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Spencer I've been having the same issue. I'm considering switching it from my 5Ghz network to my 2.4Ghz just to see if that makes a difference... Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime. Curtis Bond So this is what worked for me. Every time I used the hot-phrase it would spit out the same error, but once my wife used the hot-phrase, it started working perfectly. After that neither of us had issues. I'm pretty sure it's a software problem that's related to voice recognition. Also, big ups to AP for posting this. If Google is going to be serious about consumer electronics, they've got to stay on top of nonsense like this. A widespread failure like this should be unacceptable, and frankly should have been fixed already. Kyle Kepner I have five Google homes and 3 of them are wonky right now. Resets did not help ericshmerick Resetting will do nothing. It's a problem with ~the cloud~ LondonLeedsFan Is this feature available in the UK? Bruce Wayne And we want to trust these people to drive our cars autonomously. LOL. YuCMi Wouldn't it just chill your spine to hear your car saying, "Hmmm, something went wrong," while on a busy expressway? Đức Thành If you ever consider writing a script for a horror movie, please know that I'd like to read it and direct its movie. Just saying. YaKillaCJ I would rather have Wayne Tech JD Seeing as how they had Real life RC-able atomic powered cars in 1966 and a fully automatic self driving voice controlled car by 1989 I approve. DJ JoJo I was able to get mine working by going into home app, clicking upper right devices button. Next to Google home pic was "ready for multi user" prompt. I clicked it and trained my voice and it's working with no problems now. I had already power cycled and rebooted but that didn't work until I clicked on prompt. Defenestratus it didn't work for me for literally 3 minutes. Then it worked again. abc To be fair, it's a beta product. Bugs can happen. :) SunnyStroker Yep, that's Google! Always half Baked, always in Beta. Daniel Including Android right? I think we can cut them some slack considering how many things they give us for free. JD Its not free You are the product #productception KSubedi Almost returned mine because of that because I thought mine was defective unit. drkarlp I had mine for 9 months....I think it happened once - I re booted and all was fine. I love Google Home ! ericshmerick Wow...a positive poster. Everything okay? Garrett Johnson Fun fact. Holding the Microphone off button for 15 will do a factory data reset. According to Google's help center page you can not do a FDR from the app. Only reboot. That being said it didn't fix it for me Lars Jeppesen No issues on my GHomes located in Denmark and Brazil. Maybe a US only thing? John "OK Google, add HomePod to my shopping list." "Umm, something went wrong." ericshmerick All 3 of mine have been instantly throwing an error when I say "Hey Google." Been going on for a few days. Maddening. Markg55 All fixed. That was quick. JD My echo is working just fine thx JD Must have something to do with the prep for their Canadian launch... #blamecanada Frawlz Mine is still bugging out.

Apple's HomePod speaker pumps up the volume on tech rivals Associated Press | 0 comments SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SAN JOSE, Calif. – Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer said that 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR: New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features: New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Mac gets an upgrade: Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo-editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block autoplay videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Sizing up the iPad: Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Watch the watch: Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close WSJ ends Google users' free ride, then fades in search results By Gerry Smith • Bloomberg Jun 5, 2017 (…) After blocking Google users from reading free articles in February, the Wall Street Journal's subscription business soared, with a fourfold increase in the rate of visitors converting into paying customers. But there was a trade-off: Traffic from Google plummeted 44 percent. The reason: Google search results are based on an algorithm that scans the internet for free content. After the Journal's free articles went behind a paywall, Google's bot only saw the first few paragraphs and started ranking them lower, limiting the Journal's viewership. Executives at the Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., argue that Google's policy is unfairly punishing them for trying to attract more digital subscribers. They want Google to treat their articles equally in search rankings, despite being behind a paywall. "Any site like ours automatically doesn't get the visibility in search that a free site would," Suzi Watford, the Journal's chief marketing officer, said in an interview. "You are definitely being discriminated against as a paid news site." The Journal's experience could have implications across the news industry, where publishers are relying more on convincing readers to pay for their articles because tech giants like Google and Facebook are vacuuming up the lion's share of online advertising. The Journal's owner, News Corp., competes with Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, in providing financial news and information. With Google, publishers try to strike a balance. While they may want to sign up more subscribers by not giving away free articles, they also don't want their content to drop in search results, which drives traffic to their sites and can boost advertising sales. For that reason, many outlets with subscription businesses — like the New York Times and Financial Times — let Google users read at least one free article so they still rank high in search results. Google says its "first click free" policy is good for both consumers and publishers. People want to get the news quickly and don't want to immediately encounter a paywall. Plus, if publishers let Google users sample articles for free, there's a better chance they'll end up subscribing, Google says. The tech giant likens its policy to stores allowing people to flip through newspapers and magazines before choosing which one to buy. "For the many publishers who already take advantage of this approach, it provides the ability to protect their business model and the opportunity to convert people who sample their content into paying customers," Google said in a statement. The Journal decided to stop letting people read articles free from Google after discovering nearly 1 million people each month were abusing the three-article limit. They would copy and paste Journal headlines into Google and read the articles for free, then clear their cookies to reset the meter and read more, Watford said. The Journal now only lets Google users see a short snippet at the top of its articles, restricting the rest to its 2.2 million subscribers or people who arrive via social media. In the most recent quarter, the Journal's digital subscribers grew about 30 percent compared with the prior year, driven partly by barring Google users from reading for free. Google, meanwhile, displays a "subscription" label next to Journal articles in Google News search results, alerting users that they won't be getting a full article. The Journal's ad revenue wasn't affected by its recent drop in Google traffic because social media visits grew 34 percent in that time, keeping overall web traffic flat, Watford said. The Journal lets readers get some articles for free via social media like Twitter and Facebook, which the paper views as a marketing tool. Publishers have long complained about how their articles appear in search results. For years, many newspapers complained that online media companies published posts based on their reporting with a Google-friendly headline and appeared higher in search results. Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area Who's hired? Check our People in Business Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher The Journal's parent company, News Corp., has a tense history with Google. In 2009, Murdoch accused Google of stealing articles and threatened to pull his company's stories from its search results. News Corp. also competes with the tech giant in various ways. It's an investor in AppNexus, an advertising technology company that rivals Google's DoubleClick platform. News Corp. also owns Unruly, which competes with Google's YouTube in social video advertising. The Journal isn't the only publisher skeptical of Google's policy. Jessica Lessin, founder of The Information, a technology publication, said sampling options like Google's "first click free" program "have not proven to be as beneficial as many publishers thought." Her publication, which charges $399 a year for an online subscription, doesn't let Google users read any articles for free because it's focused on a Silicon Valley audience that's more likely to find its journalism through social media than from a Google search, she said. Google and publishers often have different objectives, said Lessin, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. Google wants to capture attention so it can sell advertising. Many publishers want to convince readers to pay. "Tech companies are always going to do what's in the interest of their business," Lessin said. That's not always the same as what's in the interest of publishers, she said. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile A new Amazon Android phone might be coming, and this one won’t be dumb Chris Smith @chris_writes June 5th, 2017 at 8:31 PM Share Tweet Remember the Fire Phone? I can’t blame you if you don’t, because it was one of the saddest smartphone releases in recent history. But it looks like Amazon hasn’t given up on making smartphones, as a new report says the company is working on a new kind of Android device, the kind that Google will like. Don't Miss: Foxconn insider drops avalanche of information about the iPhone 8, new MacBooks, Apple’s smart glasses and more That’s according to Gadgets 360’s sources, who say that Amazon has changed focus for its upcoming smartphones, and that includes operating system changes and branding. Rather than creating an Android-based operating system that would be deprived of one of the most important features of Android — that’s official Google Play app support — Amazon is making a device that runs the Android OS you expect, complete with Google support. Instead of trying to steal buyers away from the iPhone or other Android flagships, the Amazon Ice phone will be targeting the entry-level market, and especially India. The Amazon Ice has a screen between 5.2-inch and 5.5-inch and features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 chip, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, 13-megapixel camera, a fingerprint sensor on the back, Android 7.1.1 with Google Assistant support. Surprisingly, there’s no Alexa on this device, although this might change in the future. The phone should sell for Rs 6,000, which is about $93. It’s unclear at this time when the phone will launch, and whether it’ll be available in other markets. But Amazon plans to launch at least one phone in India this year, according to a source.

The BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking saw Google retain its top spot with a brand value of more than $245 billion. Amazon rose three places to number four after achieving the highest dollar value growth. The online retailer increased by $40.3 billion to $139.3 billion. Other brands making the top ten included AT&T, Visa, Tencent, IBM and McDonald's. "Strong brands continue to deliver value for the companies that own them, regardless of economic, political and category disruption," Peter Walshe, global BrandZ director at Kantar Millward Brown, said in a statement. "The BrandZ Global Top 100 is now dominated by the internet giants — brands that have operated on a global stage since day one, and which are built on powerful, innovative technology platforms," Walshe added. "This has enabled them to transcend regional and sector boundaries and grow their value at an unprecedented rate." Photo by bennymarty Google's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. In the U.K., Vodafone headed the top ten, followed by HSBC, Shell, BT and BP. Adidas was found to be the world's fastest growing brand, with its value increasing by 58 percent to $8.3 billion. The agility and innovative nature of the top tech brands was seen as a core strength. "The superstar technology brands in the BrandZ Global Top 100 are capable of abundant innovation, using their platforms to create connected ecosystems that meet multiple needs and make our lives easier," Jane Bloomfield, head of U.K. marketing for Kantar Millward Brown, said. "They also have great elasticity, confidently playing in new territories and categories to expand their customer bases," Bloomfield added. The list is now in its twelfth year. It combines measures of brand equity based on interviews with more than 3 million consumers about thousands of brands, with analysis of each company's business and financial performance, using data from both Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel.

In addition, Google is doing its part to improve meta descriptions by making a notable update to how they are rendered. How Google Generates Meta Descriptions When deciding which information to display in the snippet of a search result, Google will first turn to the content within the page itself and extract the most relevant information. In the event that a page’s content is not the most relevant source based on the user’s query, Google will then turn to the manually written meta description to display in the search snippet. Previously, if the page content was not the most relevant source for generating a snippet, and there was no meta description, Google would pull information from DMOZ. With DMOZ now closed, Google has stopped relying on the web directory for generating snippets. With that being said, it has become more important than ever for site owners to write good meta descriptions. Google goes on to explain what it considers to be a good meta description. “Good meta descriptions are short blurbs that describe accurately the content of the page. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they’re looking for.” The most common problems site owners need to watch out for when creating meta descriptions is neglecting to create them at all. Another issue is using the same meta description for all pages across the site. Other problems include writing off-topic, spammy, or low quality meta descriptions. Google says there is technically no character limit to meta descriptions, but they will be truncated to fit the width of the device they’re being viewed on. Going forward the NOODP robots directive, which prevented Google from using DMOZ to create snippets, no longer needs to be used.

Like us on Facebook. Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now SAN JOSE, California -- Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Mac gets an upgrade Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Sizing up the iPad Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera -- the same one found in the iPhone 7 -- along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Watch the watch Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. View Comments Tags Technology Video Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Sponsored Stories Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Its strange name aside, the HomePod does offer much better sound performance when compared to the Google Home and the Amazon Echo thanks to its seven built-in speakers. Would you buy a Google Home that provided a more premium speaker setup? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases On stage, Tim Cook said that Apple was going to “reinvent home music” with HomePod. The speaker is very similar to the Google Home as it has a voice assistant (Siri) built-in that can play music, answer questions, read the news, and much more. Internally, though, the HomePod differs by offering precision acoustic horns, directional sound control, and a 4-inch woofer. The tradeoff is that unlike the Google Home’s modest $130 price tag, the Apple HomePod will cost $350. For that price, someone could buy two Google Homes which offer decent sounding speakers or purchase a great sounding stand-alone speaker and plug in a Chromecast Audio for wireless music playback. So, do you think there should be a more premium version of the Google Home for better audio playback? Or would you rather just get a really nice pair of speakers that are used to only play music?

HomePod, powered Apple's Siri digital assistant, will be priced at US$349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual developers conference. "It's so cool, we really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said of the new device. HomePod will taking Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have been building momentum in the market for voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the Siri team at Apple had tuned the assistant into a "musicologist" that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the "power to rock the house," according to Schiller, who said the team worked to make HomePod an potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. Playing to strength HomePod capped a keynote presentation at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference that included updates to its iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs available on HomePod. "Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri,"  said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. "The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market so far." Some industry insiders, however, note that Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Amazon has dominated the category of connected speakers since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods or rides and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8 percent for Google Home and 5.6 percent for others including Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. Macs and iPads Cook used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan's devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named "High Sierra" in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and "intelligent tracking prevention" that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple provided look at an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. The iMac Pro was to begin shipping in December with a starting price of US$4,999. Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its mapping program. Apple also released a software kit so developers could infuse augmented reality into applications for iPhones or iPads. Given the hundreds of millions of Apple mobile devices in use, that will create the largest augmented reality platform in the world "overnight," executives said.

By Hiawatha Bray Globe Staff  June 05, 2017 Apple Inc. thinks it’s ready to compete against the popular “smart speakers” from Amazon.com and Google, with a new product that costs a lot more than its rival, but promises to sound and work much better. Apple unveiled its HomePod speaker on Monday in San Jose, Calif., at an annual meeting for developers of software for Apple products. Like the $179 Amazon Echo and $109 Google Home devices, the $349 HomePod can be controlled with verbal commands, using Apple’s familiar Siri voice recognition system. Advertisement But with Echo and Home, sound quality, though adequate, is an afterthought. Those devices are mainly marketed as intelligent home appliances that can play news and weather reports on command, or remotely control smart home systems like lighting, heating, air conditioning, and home security systems. But the HomePod is designed as a high-end audio device, stuffed with multiple speakers controlled by the same processor chip found inside Apple’s iPhone 6.

Sign up for more newsletters here “It’s perhaps the biggest brain ever in a speaker,” Philip Schiller, an Apple senior vice president, said at the event. Schiller said the HomePod contains sensors that can estimate the speaker’s position in a room and then tune the sound for optimal quality. The HomePod’s high-frequency speakers use a technology called “beam-forming” to aim different audio frequencies in different directions to make the sound more immersive. In addition, the HomePod comes with a much improved version of Siri. When the speech recognition feature was introduced on the iPhone in 2011, it was hailed as a technical marvel. Since then, it’s been widely criticized for its limited ability to respond to commonplace questions. Advertisement HomePod’s version of Siri will be capable of understanding casual questions with ease, particularly questions about music, Schiller said. Users can ask the HomePod the name of the drummer in a particular recording, for example, or what song was the most popular in the United States on a particular date. Users who hear a tune they enjoy can add it to a playlist by simply saying, “Hey Siri, I like that song.” HomePod will serve up the tunes through a connection with Apple Music, the company’s subscription service, which claims about 27 million listeners worldwide. Despite the emphasis on audio quality, Apple is also pitching HomePod as a home automation controller, similar to its competitors. The speaker works with the company’s HomeKit service, which links smart home devices to Apple products. With HomePod, a user could turn up the air conditioning, close the living-room blinds, and turn on the lawn sprinkler just by saying so. William Ablondi, director of smart home strategies at Strategy Analytics, a Newton-based research firm, said HomePod could appeal to consumers who don’t mind paying extra for the cachet of an Apple product. “Coming in at the high end of the market is a classic Apple move,” said Ablondi. And the success of relatively pricey speakers from companies like Framingham’s Bose Corp., he added, proves there’s a market for better sound. Apple has some catching up to do; a January report from the investment bank Morgan Stanley estimated that Amazon has sold over 11 million Echo devices since the product was introduced two years ago. And Strategy Analytics estimates Google Home will crack 1 million sold by midyear. Still, that means most people still don’t own one of these gadgets, leaving plenty of room for Apple. While the HomePod was the most momentous announcement from Apple on Monday, the company revealed a host of upgrades to its other product lines. These included a massively-powerful Mac workstation computer and improvements to Apple’s operating system software for its smartwatches, Mac computers, iPads, and iPhones. Apple also showed that it’s serious about making a mark in augmented reality (AR) software, which overlays digital images on top of the real world. AR became a hit with video gamers with Pokemon Go. Apple showed off a new system to help game developers build even more advanced AR games that would be playable on iPhones and iPads. A demo of the technology, called ARKit, featured AR effects that looked far more advanced than those of rival systems, like Google’s Tango or Microsoft’s HoloLens. An Apple video game demonstrated at the conference is supposed to come to market by year’s end. Loading comments... Top 10 Trending Articles Most Viewed Most Commented Most Shared Real journalists.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 239 Plus 1 on G+ 1179 Share on Facebook 437 Share on Twitter Total Shares1418 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SafetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms that: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play Store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here. 'Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreken geen Nederlands' Or do you like to use translate with everything freaking post Φώτης Chill. It was literally just two words. Not that big of a deal, don't you think? AnubArack Is it that hard to write 2 words in another language then? Kevin Strident Yo no se. You try it. Φώτης Of course not. Actually this is exactly what happened :p AnubArack You and @kevinstrident:disqus are sooooo funny. Less contextually aware than a virtual assistant. d0x360 Yes exactly lol Patrick Ahles *spreekt ;) DavidEssex Yes. I have for years. Twatberry XwaitXwhatX This is an English website Which caters to android users all across the globe pcriz Show me what rule he is breaking. Please quote it for me. Otherwise have as much right to ignore him as he does to speak whatever language he wants. Geezz what a buncha cry babies xyz He is breaking the most important rule of the internet which is faasusu polo asini. pcriz I could try and translate that and feed a troll. Or I can go on living my life. I may choose the latter. C'est la vie, damn how easy (adult) was that ? d0x360 You can talk in whatever language you want. You won't get many people paying any attention to anything you say but who cares? Also...use Google to translate it. It's that button at the very bottom. Yes, exactly xyz Du-te dracului Rebel without a Clue Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreekt ;) C64 Sorry i was stoned 🤣 Rebel without a Clue Hahaha ok dan mag het Keletor Thank you much! You are awesome, and I totally respect you for that statement and the use of the Commodore insignia. AntiCoyote Not really fair, every single Dutch person I know speaks English as well as an American :o) C64 I'm sorry that we Dutch learn English at school :p davidus The real reason behind this is that there arent many ppl to talk to in first place, if u only speak dutch. Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means. DavidEssex How about not being ignorant. xyz Ignorant? No one speaks every language in the world, dipshit. Өөрийгөө Зөндөө Go ArclightX flüggåәnkб€čhiœßølįên There! Now put that in your pipe and smoke it! C64 Don't quit your day job Narg While I prefer English, I have to say that web browsers today make it dirt simple to translate anything, why get all worked up about this? Not using the tools at hand just show ignorance and lethargy. nasznjoka umetisha mzazi asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both. Artem can't install it on his unlocked Google Pixel XL. h4rr4r Huh? He can install it, just not from the play store. Apk mirror, soon back answer. Corbin Davenport Yes, that's what I meant.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). Yan Minari You better tell us more about how you set up this. stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. DJMix How is it only bobbuttons' comment that made sense? They all basically say the same thing. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Thomas Gladdines That's nonsense, the recovery works fine with or without a locked bootloader. Only fastboot won't work but that's only needed when you don't have a custom recovery to flash images. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. Actually l like bezels Why? What do you get with root? BobButtons Primarily for system level ad-blocking. None of the non-root options can even compare. I refuse to allow ads when they have the ability to fill the entire screen and vibrate the phone. Even with being able to block ads, I still purchase the ad-free option of apps I support. Matthew Wilson Updates. Security updates. DJMix What do you mean what do we get from root? We get everything! Everything! YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. 天地人 Theft is when I take your bike and it's gone and you do not have a bike anymore. When I pirate, are you losing your software or your right to sell your software? Plus, if you actually developed software, I'd probably pay for it since you aren't some big corporation. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. 天地人 Of course it depends on what you're watching. The same ideology cannot be applied to everything. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. Railwayman Good that you have your Samsung. Also great that you have your 10-12 inch tablets. I assume you bring them everywhere? Very is easy more elegant than a Samsung. It doesn't mean they are the best but way better looking than a Galaxy 8, which I have been tried and I just don't see any reason to get it because of the way Samsung design things. You like to be locked down to a carrier. Google Voice work perfectly well here without any network problems. If the network coverage is so bad that modern services doesn't work I rather jump to a satellite provider if I really need the ability to call from the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't get VZW and eliminate my device choice site to them being very restrictive about what I am allowed to use. Having a carrier dependent phone number is very... 1996. I just don't accept such a limitation - especially not the thing called roaming. I just switch my SIM card to a local one and continue to receive calls as usual. The beauty of GV. If you think iOS is the way to go if Grace UX would disappear I think you should get the iPhone then. It seems like out of the box is the most important aspect. I just don't know any device that has an out of the box experience even close to my requirements. Samsung is certainly furthest way from them. I just dislike their devices because of their design, software, carrier affiliation and serious restrictions. They just feel like a budget device full of carrier advertisement and bloatware. Richard Markert I disagree with you in every possible way. Yes, I do take at least my Surface 3 almost everywhere. My Z10 LTE goes when I'll want to play games or watch Netflix on a tiny screen with crappy headphones. Vertu: You say elegant, I say gaudy, tacky, trashy and fucking ugly, like most things marketed to people with more money than God and less sense than a cricket. I don't know where you live, work, play or travel, but many times a year I'm driving in places, especially the highways, that will have no data coverage. It's that simple. All your google voice hijinks mean nothing when you have -100 dBm of 1x and the mobile data network is completely unavailable. I can still make and receive calls at that point, because Verizon, but you're shit out of luck because you only give people your GV (interface is barf, btw) number. Oh, and for the record, I just flashed the US Unlocked FW to my S8, so now I have no Verizon junkware or restrictions, like my S7e before it. And yes, at this point in my life, I'm sick and tired of having to do the software developers' job for them. When I was younger I found all that rom cooking, kernel coding, smali editing, adb pushing, su manipulating stuff fun and exciting, but now all I want is a phone with the features that I want that Just Works OOB. I also feel the way you do about stock android. It's design, included software, limitations and style are not appealing. And every phone is "a carrier advertisement", and has always been that way. Until the S8, every phone came with a carrier logo if you bought from a carrier. I get what you want from a phone, I really do. You want a basic device with no features that you can add onto to do what you want. But man, you gotta stop acting like you're the Westboro Baptist Church and Samsung is the homosexual community. Railwayman Samsung is not the homosexual community, right. They are the mainstream community where everyone eat at McDonald's.:) The homosexual community is more about being different rather than following the mainstream, i.e. the opposite of Samsung (it is hard to be more Average Joe adjusted than they are...). The day I really want coverage in "every possible place" is the day I get myself a satellite phone, especially if I am to drive in remote land where I can't rely on decent carrier coverage. Your attempts to put down Google Voice is amusing. Verizon are going to shut down their CDMA network and HTC U11 is already out, with support for their LTE but not the old fashioned thing also known as 1X.:) It is also amusing that you argue that hard against vanilla Android. Did you ever consider iOS or Windows Phone? If I would dislike vanilla that much, down to a dislike for Material Design I would switch platform immediately. If I don't like the system the way its creator intended it then perhaps it isn't for me and I switch. Relying on some third party OEM to "modify it to my liking" is a bit naive. A Samsung has something that is an "Android based OS" very much like Nokia X/XL had the Android based "Nokia Software Platform". I also notice your misconception about how other devices work. My device runs perfectly well. It just... works. It has a lot of features not present on a Samsung (yes, I have used the S 8/Plus), consume 0.1% per hour in standby, provide me 12-13 hours SOT and simply do more things than any "out-of-the-box Samsung" does and do them well. Samsung make pretty simple devices, with ill designed software full of bloatware and "added value" applications and services reducing performance and increase power consumption. I would say bling. Then we have other devices offering more useful features, higher performance, lower power consumption, more elegant design and so on. What they don't offer is the marketing known as Samsung. It's a good thing, actually - it leads to better value for money. BTW, Google Voice is simply a vastly superior service compared to VZW. You can start travel (out of the US) or trying to get your texts synced into your Google account with your carrier based service... Bragging about 1X is like bragging about EDGE coverage in... 2017. "My carrier is better than yours because I have 1X service on the soon-to-be-gone CDMA network on my Samsung and it makes it so much better than using modern IP based services! I am truly modern with my Samsung! My phone number is also controlled by my carrier and I must pay roaming when I travel, which is great - more money to Verizon! Much, much better than using GV on a data plan!" The day I need "coverage out in the nowhere land" I either get the satellite phone or some burner for that very purpose (it's a case of simply routing the GV calls to that thing). I know since before that modern communication services are a bit alien to proud owners of carrier branded Samsung devices. It is hard to think outside the box - much easier to just use Samsung with branding and everything.:) Good luck with your Samsung. Consider an iPhone next time. Apple has a new one coming and it can give you some taste of what being unlocked means (buy it from Apple Store). I think it can be enlightening, especially if you try the Genius Bar as well (i.e. better service than Samsung could ever offer through the carriers). Richard Markert I get it, you're a Google and Stock Android zealot. I read maybe 3 words of your damn novel. I do want you to answer this question without a dissertation And 500 page thesis: what are you going to do when you're in the middle of nowhere in a dead sport for data and your car breaks down? Railwayman The day I know that I will be in need for 1X coverage on Verizon I get a burner phone with such support before traveling. You make it sound like it is something really and truly unique with such coverage and that your Samsung is a marvel because it offer it. Verizon just introduced a flip phone with full support for their LTE network. So it doesn't take a Samsung to get there. The only requirement I have is tethering (if the purpose is to use the device of choice) - basic talk/text will do otherwise. So no, I just don't need a Samsung even in the "1X middle of the nowhere with a broken car" scenario. If it is very important with calling in dead spots - go and check Iridium, GlobalStar or Thuraya. I would go down that route in an instant if I really need coverage in "no mans land". So no, there are no single scenario where a Samsung is "needed" for whatever reason. Everything that brand can do can be done with other brands. Simple as that. Richard Markert Why do you always write a novel? We get it, you hate Samsung like Trump hates Mexicans. Shut up already. Railwayman I don't hate that brand is overrated and hyped. Mexicans are approximately 1286 times more sophisticated and polished than any Samsung. They don't even have Knox, which is a major benefit. Now go and enjoy 1X on your Galaxy. Don't forget the grave beer when VZW down, though. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? Mariano Moreira I am using Factory Images because I can choose to only use Bootslot B this way. Bootslot A on this current Pixel and the 3 before it has the non-working mic and no working headphone jack issue. I hear the issue is resolved on newer handsets, but have not RMA'd this device yet. I need the microphone and headphone jack, so letting the phone do an OTA and move me to Bootslot A is no-go. *I have N2G47O installed on both Bootslot A and Bootslot B, currently. Only Bootslot A has the audio issue even thought the exact same Factory Image is installed. saf1927 Oh, wasn't aware of that. Did it affect all the old devices? I got mine at launch but haven't experienced the issues you describe. Is there a way to reproduce them? I normally either take the OTA or flash the OTA images via fastboot. Mariano Moreira Allegedly only 1% of devices (I just have bad luck, I suppose.) https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsIW_gxTpXX3s/?hl=by I have posts around late November- early December on in that thread about mic/headphone jack issue My 1st device was fine until after the 2nd Update, but I had not diagnosed Bootslot A/B discrepancy. Wasn't until after 2nd Device (1st Replacement) that I have been able to always get Bootslot A to have faulty mic on my replacement devices. My Cousin and his girlfriend both have Pixel XLs. He had a dead Mic out of the box but currently neither his nor his Girlfriend's Pixel XL has mic issue. Even with forcing Bootslot A for a month of testing. I most likely have another faulty device, just this is my 4th Pixel from Google and everything is fine except Bootslot A. jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix. Lawstorant Magisk stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy Linus Monie If you are this afraid of someone potentially fiddling around with your code, the problem is not the 'fiddler', it is your code. Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... My1 yeah true. pirating on phone makes (quoting austin from game theory) NO. GOD. DAMN. SENSE. I mean I dunno whether you can automate that so good and/or get it fast enough, especially with the relatively low storage, no LAN capability and so on. BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users! Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review. Links to both apps (Android TV and the normal Android app) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en&rdid=com.netflix.mediaclient https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.ninja&rdid=com.netflix.ninja Yoda’s Spirit Seems they keep cracking down on anything Open internet related! The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support... Google "TerrariumTV". :D You are welcome. :D Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 Mobile devices are now a vice.The rules,whether stringent or lenient,if there's demand,the market will fill the demand.Plain and simple.So to Mr.Gable,your wrong buttercup. Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive. Kevin Davis So I can't update my Netflix app on my unaltered Google Store Pixel XL. FUCK YOU NETFLIX, and goodbye, you SONS OF BITCHES. Signed, a former longtime top tier subscriber, until, as of now. Once again, so there is no doubt: FUCK YOU NETFLIX, and goodbye. Sent from my Google Store Pixel XL. theinternetmakesyoustupid who the hell watches netflix on their phone.. johnforamerica Chromecast? Sledge If you have the app installed you can use the in app option to call netflix over wifi. Do this. Be heard. Don't let them continue to push back against the right to tinker. McHenryGames Main reason to root is XPosed. Screw Netflix and screw Google. Brian Both my phone and tablet are as they left they left the factory. Both are blocked form the new update, neither is rooted. Looked like they are trying to promote rival services as it is unacceptable to block legitimate users on a paying service. ED-Zが現れた! Well... Time to change my rate from 5 to 1... Thomas That's a surprising backward move from Netflix, a company that I admire and follow, not just as customer but as an engineer. I wonder if, adding up with their experimental price hike, someone with the wrong ideas got recently hired...

Eight years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial intelligence products is as fundamental to the company's next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone in sleekly-designed hardware and services. AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple's rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn't profile consumers. Moreover, Apple's longstanding penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country's top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. "Artificial intelligence is not in Apple's DNA," said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Steve Munster. "They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot." At Apple's annual developer's conference on Monday - the same event where Jobs introduced Siri - the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new standalone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri's chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. "Machine learning" -- an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultra-fast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling -- was repeated throughout the 2.5 hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute -- or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company's Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, HomePod. She will automatically organize your photos into albums, like "2nd Anniversary," without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software toolkit, CoreML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It's six times faster than Google's rival AI processor, an executive quipped). But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence, ranging from software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully-functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind - and where the effort cuts against the core aspects of the company's secretive culture. "This is a substantial shift for Apple," said Daniel Gross, a former executive who focused on artificial intelligence. "The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers." Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company's revenues, which were $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company's iconic smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones is finally saturated. "The difference between last year's iPhone and this year's iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. ... So that s-curve is starting to flatten out," said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. "Then you have the next transformative technology, that isn't here yet." Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple's launch of HomePod, which will go for sale for $349 later this year, comes several years after Amazon and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers' spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday's updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified web search that could tell the occasional pre-programmed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as "deep" or "unsupervised" learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain's neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protege of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world's top researcher in this area. Like Salakhutdinov, who divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple, Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products, but becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. "You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do," Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper in artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a prestigious computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was "off the scale" in terms of secrecy, and that such secrecy was keeping them out of loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino giant was "making some changes." "But it's going to take some work," he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates - Google, Facebook, and Amazon were by far the top picks - but that the company was moving up in the rankings. Apple's forays into AI have also been slower than its peers because it's been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy when it did so. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer's conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people's speech in order to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations, and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise - or bad information - into good data in order to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn't know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple's focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. "Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science, and doing so to try and preserve your privacy," he said. "I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving." Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. "The bad news is that Apple is behind," he said. "The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it's still early days -- there is plenty of time to catch up." <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 워싱턴포스트 다른기사 보기 페이스북 이메일 기사 수정 :   2017-06-06 09:21   김동균 기자 웹출판 :   2017-06-06 09:24   관리자 입력.편집 :   2017-06-06 09:06   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 빅뱅 탑, 대마초 흡연 경찰조사부터 중환자실行까지 '웃찾사'가 막내린 이유? 코미디 프로의 '종말론' 현대·기아차 출시 앞둔 소형SUV ‘엇갈린 운명’ 스토닉 출시준비 순조… 코나는 노사갈등에 험난한 여정 ‘필리핀 계엄령’에도 여행사들은 항공권 취소 수수료 챙겨 “회사방침”… 안전위협 여행지 불구 ‘장삿속’ 불만 폭주 "시오니스트가 평화의 전사?"…'원더우먼' 보이콧 확산되나 빅뱅 탑, 대마초 흡연 경찰조사부터 중환자실行까지 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today provided details about its June 2017 security patches for Android devices. The patches, dated June 1 and June 5, plug a significant number of security holes that threaten all Android devices. Google found dozens and dozens of vulnerabilities, of which it classified several as critical, or able to remotely execute code. Many of the problems are related to specific chipsets and the associated software drivers that control them, such as components from MediaTek and Qualcomm. Google is offering the patches directly to Nexus- and Pixel-branded devices first. Google has already posted factory images for download directly from its web site. Google's handsets will receive both patches in a single download. Google said that, as far as it is aware, none of these security holes have been exploited. Google has already given the patches to its OEM partners. Individual phone makers are responsible for updating their own hardware with the patches. more info at Google » Related Review: OtterBox Commuter for Google Pixel XL OtterBox's Commuter case for the Pixel XL is a rugged, rubber-and-plastic shell that provides plenty of protection for your pricey smartphone slab.

The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. New iMacs are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes.

News & Analysis Apple Turns Up Speakers, AR Sounds better, but not as smart Rick Merritt 6/5/2017 08:01 PM EDT 4 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Apple announced a $349, Siri-powered speaker, leveraging its expertise in music against rivals Amazon and Google. It also rolled out developer’s kits for augmented reality and machine learning on iOS 11 and upgraded its Macintosh and iPad computers. The HomePod is a 6.8-inch speaker driven by an Apple A8 SoC to handle echo cancellation and optimize sound for a given space. It packs a four-inch woofer and an array of seven tweeters, each with its own driver to deliver better sound than smart speakers such as Alexa and Google Home. “This is really going after Sonos and Bose home speakers--the audio is superior to Sonos--music is in Apple’s DNA,” said Tim Bajarin, president of market watcher Creative Strategies (Campbell, Calif.). “It’s not designed like Amazon’s Alexa as a front end to online stores…my gut says they will sell millions of these as a powerful home speaker,” he added. Nevertheless, HomePod sports a six-mic array to respond to natural language commands, putting a toe in the water of the smart-speaker market Amazon dominates. HomePod does not enable the range of some 12,000 tasks of Alexa or the range of queries Google supports. Initially, HomePod is prepped for a short list of topics that include music, traffic, weather, stock quotes, unit conversions and translating between a small set of language pairs. Apple’s Siri agent on the iPhone is available in 21 languages, although the HomePod will initially ship only for English. Apple also announced a new translation service in Siri between English, Chinese and the four most popular European languages. The speakers also can be used to control home automation devices built to work with Apple’s HomeKit, which now sports AirPlay 2. The upgraded protocol supports multi-room audio, shared playlists and control via Apple TV. A dozen speaker makers are supporting the protocol as part of a new HomeKit speaker category. “We want to reinvent home music,” said Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, in rolling out HomePod.

With the speaker Apple entirely misses the point. The idea is to figure out what can be an affordable device that can go in every room to put Siri everywhere. A TV box doesn't quite fit in every room , an affordable speaker can go just about anywhere but who's gonna buy 5-10 speakers at 350$ each? This generates some revenue but doesn't really help Apple as it will go in rooms that are already Siri enabled.

Author: Scott Gilbertson. Scott Gilbertson Date of Publication: 01.23.12. 01.23.12 Time of Publication: 12:11 pm. 12:11 pm Google Tweaks Search Results to Punish Ad-Heavy Websites Google has tweaked its search algorithm to punish websites with excessive advertising “above-the-fold,” that is, websites that stack the top of the page with nothing but advertisements. According to Google, “rather than scrolling down the page past a slew of ads, users want to see content right away.” To help users get to that content, Google may drop ad-heavy websites from its search results. Google says that the change will only affect about one in 100 searches, and emphasizes that websites using what Google’s Distinguished Engineer and SEO guru Matt Cutts calls “ads above-the-fold to a normal degree” will not be affected. Instead the change is designed to punish sites that “go much further to load the top of the page with ads to an excessive degree or that make it hard to find the actual original content on the page.” In other words, if a site is so packed with ads that people can’t find what they’re looking for then Google isn’t going to send them to that site anymore. While the distinction seems clear at first glance, digging deeper reveals some potential confusion for webmasters — for example, what role does screen size play? On a netbook, for instance, Google’s own search results page is almost entirely taken over by advertisements, not the actual search results (i.e., the content). Google on a netbook screen: Ads are in red, search results in green At small screen resolutions, Google’s own search results page is one of the worst offenders when it comes to advertising clutter obscuring content. That seeming hypocrisy may leave some webmasters wondering what constitutes “a normal degree of ads” and how screen size affects what is defined as “normal.” Sticking simply with what Google has written about the change, copying Google’s search results page is probably not a good idea in this case. Cutts does encourage webmasters view their websites at different screen resolutions, suggesting that screen size does play a role, but unfortunately he doesn’t offer any details about what that role is or how it affects the algorithm’s new layout ranking scheme.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Apple on Monday unveiled its “HomePod” speaker as it moved to challenge Amazon Alexa and Google Home as a smart home and music hub. HomePod, powered Apple’s Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual developers conference. “It’s so cool, we really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said of the new device. ADVERTISEMENT HomePod will taking Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have been building momentum in the market for voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the Siri team at Apple had tuned the assistant into a “musicologist” that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the “power to rock the house,” according to Schiller, who said the team worked to make HomePod a potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. Playing to strength HomePod capped a keynote presentation at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference that included updates to its iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs available on HomePod. “Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. ADVERTISEMENT “The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market so far.” Some industry insiders, however, note that Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Amazon has dominated the category of connected speakers since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods or rides and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8 percent for Google Home and 5.6 percent for others including Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. Macs and iPads Cook used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan’s devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named “High Sierra” in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and “intelligent tracking prevention” that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple provided look at an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. The iMac Pro was to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999. Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its mapping program. Apple also released a software kit so developers could infuse augmented reality into applications for iPhones or iPads. Given the hundreds of millions of Apple mobile devices in use, that will create the largest augmented reality platform in the world “overnight,” executives said.

Wall Street Journal’s Google traffic drops 44% after pulling out of First Click Free Despite less traffic, paid subscriber conversion said to be up fourfold. Danny Sullivan on June 5, 2017 at 4:48 pm More In February, The Wall Street Journal stopped participating in a program allowing Google visitors to bypass its paywall. The publication has now discovered, as was predicted, that it no longer gets as much traffic from Google. In an interview with Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal reported that its Google traffic plunged 44 percent after leaving the “First Click Free” program. First Click Free allows visitors from Google to access articles that are normally behind paywalls for free, when they click to them from Google’s search results. Many publishers participate in the program because they find the traffic and related ad-revenue offsets potential lost subscription revenue. When a publisher is not in the program, Google cannot fully index the articles it publishes. That means those articles are less likely to appear for a wider range of topics. That can hurt potential traffic from Google. In addition, such articles are also listed with a “subscription” designation next to them, which might put off some people who lack subscriptions from clicking through. The WSJ seems a bit surprised and possibly upset over the traffic drop. Suzi Watford, the Journal’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg: “Any site like ours automatically doesn’t get the visibility in search that a free site would. … You are definitely being discriminated against as a paid news site.” It was pretty clear from Google’s own rules, as I’ve covered before, that such a traffic drop was likely. The WSJ certainly knew it could happen and deliberately chose to leave the program. From my previous article, it told me: We are constantly experimenting with different ways to enhance the digital experience for members. As a continuation of this, the Journal has broadened its test by removing content available through Google’s First Click Free. The test began last month when the Journal removed four sections, resulting in subscription growth driven directly from content. What’s also important here is that while the WSJ’s overall traffic has dropped, it had — as Bloomberg notes — a fourfold increase in subscription conversions. Losing that traffic and the potential ad revenue with it may well have been offset or exceeded by subscription revenue — which was the original stated goal. Also to the WSJ’s benefit, Google is only showing a “subscription” designation when stories appear in Google News, like this: However, Google fails to show such a designation in its regular search results, as shown below: I’d long been under the impression that Google would use a “subscription” designation for any type of subscription content in web search results. It’s something I recall in the past for when Google Scholar content appeared. However, Google tells me the designation is only used within Google News, not within regular Google search results. It doesn’t even show when subscription content appears in the “Top stories” section of Google search. About The Author Danny Sullivan Danny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

But there was a trade-off: Traffic from Google plummeted 44 percent. The reason: Google search results are based on an algorithm that scans the Internet for free content. After the Journal’s articles went behind a paywall, Google’s bot only saw the first few paragraphs and started ranking them lower, limiting viewership. Executives at the Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., argue that Google’s policy is unfairly punishing them for trying to attract more digital subscribers. They want Google to treat their articles equally in search rankings, despite being behind a paywall. “Any site like ours automatically doesn’t get the visibility in search that a free site would,” Suzi Watford, the Journal’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview. “You are definitely being discriminated against as a paid news site.” Latest business videos The Journal’s experience could have implications across the news industry, where publishers are relying more on persuading readers to pay for their articles because tech giants like Google and Facebook are vacuuming up the lion’s share of online advertising. With Google, publishers try to strike a balance. While they may want to sign up more subscribers by not giving away free articles, they also don’t want their content to drop in search results, which drives traffic to their sites and can boost advertising sales. For that reason, many outlets with subscription businesses let Google users read at least one free article so they still rank high in search results. Google says its “first click free” policy is good for both consumers and publishers. People want to get the news quickly and don’t want to immediately encounter a paywall. Plus, if publishers let Google users sample articles for free, there’s a better chance they’ll end up subscribing, Google says. The Mountain View company likens its policy to stores allowing people to flip through newspapers and magazines before choosing which one to buy. The Journal decided to stop letting people read articles free from Google after discovering nearly 1 million people each month were abusing the three-article limit. They would copy and paste Journal headlines into Google and read the articles for free, then clear their cookies to reset the meter and read more, Watford said. The Journal now only lets Google users see a short snippet at the top of its articles, restricting the rest to its 2.2 million subscribers or people who arrive via social media. In the most recent quarter, the Journal’s digital subscribers grew about 30 percent compared with the prior year, driven partly by barring Google users from reading for free. Google, meanwhile, displays a “subscription” label next to Journal articles in Google News search results, alerting users that they won’t be getting a full article. Gerry Smith is a Bloomberg writer.

It's brand valuation nudged up by 5% to $143 billion. Amazon has been on fire over the past year and its brand value surged by 41% to hit $139 billion. Google's brand is associated with innovative research, self-driving cars and helpful online services like Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Maps. Apple's brand value nudged up by 3% to $235 billion, helping it retain the No. 2 position in the ranking. But the brand has lost some shine since 2015 when it topped the BrandZ ranking. By Alanna Petroff LONDON (CNNMoney) -- China now has one of the world's most valuable brands. Shenzhen-based tech firm Tencent has broken into a ranking of the top 10 most valuable brands published by BrandZ. The annual ranking is typically dominated by American companies with global reach, making the inclusion of a Chinese firm notable. Tencent specializes in popular online games, apps, instant messaging services and online payments. It boasts a market capitalization of $330 billion, making it worth more than America's most valuable bank: JPMorgan Chase. Here's a round-up of the world's 10 most valuable brands: 1. Google Google is still the most valuable brand in the world; a title it has retained for seven out of the past 11 years. It's brand value -- worth just over $245 billion -- increased by 7% from 2016. The company has transformed itself from a simple search engine to an all-encompassing lifestyle brand, said Doreen Wang, Global Head of BrandZ. Google's brand is associated with innovative research, self-driving cars and helpful online services like Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Maps. Bonus: The company consistently ranks as one of the world's best employers. 2. Apple Apple's brand value nudged up by 3% to $235 billion, helping it retain the No. 2 position in the ranking. But the brand has lost some shine since 2015 when it topped the BrandZ ranking. Wang said Apple's "innovation speed over the last year is not perceived to be as fast as Google or Amazon." BrandZ's ranking relies heavily on consumer perceptions. If people can't see that Apple is being innovative, its brand value will suffer. 3. Microsoft Microsoft has landed in the third slot for three years running. It's brand valuation nudged up by 5% to $143 billion. "The key word is Microsoft Cloud," said Wang, who said the success of the company's cloud and business services helped improve consumer perceptions. Microsoft generates nearly a third of its revenue and almost 40% of its operating profits from its "Intelligent Cloud" line of businesses. Investors are clearly happy with the company: Shares have shot up by about 16% since the start of the year. 4. Amazon Amazon has been on fire over the past year and its brand value surged by 41% to hit $139 billion. "Wherever the consumers go, Amazon is going," said Wang. "At this moment, that is the right strategy." The retail giant offers a wide range of services: online shopping, grocery delivery, cloud computing and entertainment are just the tip of the iceberg. It's continuing to develop artificial intelligence services and its personal digital assistant, Alexa. Investors have taken notice too, bidding up shares by 34% since the start of the year. 5. Facebook The Facebook brand continues to perform well, despite scandals over fake news and violent events streamed live on its platform. Users think of Facebook as "friendly" and "helpful," said Wang. This has helped convince advertisers to move onto the platform, and users don't seem to mind the growth in advertised content, she said. Facebook's brand value shot up by 27% over the past year to hit $130 billion. 6. AT&T Telecom giant AT&T has appeared in the ranking for seven consecutive years and its brand has increased in value by 65% over that period. It's now worth $115 billion. "It's becoming a more dynamic brand and increasing communications with consumers," said Wang. The company is trying to close an acquisition of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, that is worth about $109 billion including debt. If the purchase goes ahead, it would be one of the biggest takeovers of all time. 7. Visa Visa is an American company with a name that's recognized around the world. The company's brand value increased 10% to hit $111 billion this year. The brand got a particularly big boost after Costco ended its relationship with American Express last year in favor of a new one with Visa and Citigroup. Millions of former Costco AmEx cards were subsequently transferred to Visa and Citi. 8. Tencent Led by its media-shy CEO, "Pony" Ma Huateng, Tencent is huge in China, where its messaging platform WeChat is used for everything from texting to booking karaoke sessions. BrandZ said that increased used of WeChat helped to propel Tencent into the top 10 for the first time. Its brand value jumped 27% to $108 billion. The only other Chinese firm to have cracked the top 10 is China Mobile, but it's hasn't appeared on the list since 2013. Tencent is hoping to avoid that same fate by expanding globally. It announced plans last month to set up an artificial intelligence research lab in Seattle. "Right now they're very aggressive in going beyond China," said Wang. 9. IBM IBM has been included in the ranking since it started in 2006. This year the brand has been valued at $102 billion, up 18% from last year. The company has helped boost its consumer appeal through the development of the artificial intelligence mascot Watson. "Watson is the face of the company's transformation," said Wang. 10. McDonald's McDonald's is the only truly non-tech company to be featured in the top 10 ranking this year. The brand has received a boost by introducing more healthy food options. It's also offering more locally-inspired options in places like China and India, said Wang. "McDonald's has been doing pretty well compared to the other fast food restaurants," she said.

By Emily Bary and Nicholas Jasinski June 5, 2017 5:29 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple's $349 HomePod speaker comes out in December. Photo: Apple Apple has finally made its much-anticipated entrance into the smart home speaker market with the “HomePod,” announced Monday afternoon at WWDC. Given how much hype the device got from the rumor mill before its reveal, Apple nerds (and investors) might be disappointed by its high price tag and lack of revolutionary new features. HomePod is a 7-inch tall Apple-engineered wireless speaker with a large woofer and seven smaller speakers. The $349 WiFi-connected unit includes six microphones and the same chip that powers your iPhone. You can use voice controls to turn on lights, set timers, play music, and handle your usual Siri commands. Apple’s not the first to come out with a voice-controlled speaker, and its device costs more than the two big players combined; the HomePod will sell for $349, while the Amazon Echo costs $180 and the Google Home goes for $130. Essentially Apple is betting that its ecosystem is worth twice Amazon’s or Google’s. Apple tried to justify the HomePod's steep price tag in its WWDC keynote. Photo: Apple Apple has a history of introducing devices with high price points and still managing to outsell the competition, but such a premium over other smart home speakers might be hard to justify -- especially given the Alexa-powered Echo’s head start. An industry report earlier this year estimated that the Echo would make up 70% of the voice-controlled speaker market by year end. (The report didn’t take into account the possibility of an Apple speaker, but the Home Pod won’t be out until December anyway.) Apple’s PR machine is already working overtime to convince consumers that the HomePod is worth the money. “It takes the listening experience to a whole new level,” reads a quintessentially Apple description of the new product. “And that’s just the beginning.” Besides a more-advanced speaker, the HomePod doesn’t seem to have any features that its competitors haven’t had for months. Siri is touted as a big selling point for the device, but it has plenty of room for improvement. Marketing agency Stone Temple recently asked Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana each the same 5,000 general knowledge questions and rated their replies for accuracy. Google Assistant and Cortana each got more than half right, while Siri and Alexa barely answered more than 20% correctly. At least Amazon already has its device in millions of homes. The HomePod won’t even be out until the end of the year. Overall, Apple’s announcements at WWDC didn’t wow investors. Shares dropped 1% on Monday after an analyst downgrade. And Wall Street isn’t sold on the HomePod’s potential. “Given the price point relative to competitive offerings, we would expect the near-term impact from HomePod to be immaterial,” Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson wrote in a note to clients.

Apple is getting serious about competing with Amazon’s and Google’s infiltration of the home. At the company’s annual developer conference on Monday, Apple announced a new Wi-Fi speaker called HomePod that will play music and respond to voice commands with Apple’s digital assistant, Siri. HomePod will be released in December for $349, and it's meant to work with Apple's $10-per-month subscription music service, Apple Music. HomePod marks Apple’s attempt to put a stake in the smart-home assistant hardware market, an area currently dominated by Amazon’s growing array of Alexa-running devices, like its Echo speaker, and Google’s Home gadget, which runs Google Assistant.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences HomePod doesn’t have a display, but when you say “Hey Siri” to invoke Apple’s assistant, the top of the device lights up. It can do things Siri already does, like deliver weather, traffic, or sports updates. You can also use it to relay voice commands to smart appliances that use Apple’s smart-home software, HomeKit (these include a range of smart bulbs, thermostats, and so on, but excludes Google-owned Nest’s smart thermostat). In many ways, Apple kicked off the mass-market digital personal assistant trend in 2011 with the release of Siri for the iPhone, then considered novel for its abilities to respond to commands to make phone calls, check the weather, or set up an appointment (though its ability to understand queries was sometimes comically bad). Siri was originally developed at SRI International as part of a DARPA-funded artificial intelligence project called CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes) and spun out as a startup; Apple purchased it in 2010. Apple has lagged behind Google and Amazon, however, in incorporating Siri into a voice-operated household device, and it was widely expected to start selling its own. After all, the market for such devices is growing fast, and projected to keep expanding: in a report this month, research firm eMarketer predicted nearly 36 million Americans will use a speaker-based voice-assistant each month this year, more than twice as many as a year ago. About 71 percent of them will be using Amazon’s Echo speaker, while Google’s Home captures about 24 percent of the market. This overall adoption is still tiny compared to, say, the number of people using smartphones every month, but is growing faster. Yet even as Apple showed off HomePod—which it saved for last during the more than two-hour presentation—the company seemed to deliberately undersell the device as an all-around home assistant. Instead, it positioned the product as a more of a smart speaker that is wedded to Apple Music and happens to also have other capabilities thanks to its Siri integration.  Recommended for You First Quantum-Secured Blockchain Technology Tested in Moscow The Desktop of the Future Is Coming Experts Predict When Artificial Intelligence Will Exceed Human Performance Google Sprinkles AI on Its Spreadsheets to Automate Away Some Office Work Secret Algorithms Threaten the Rule of Law First, there’s the name, HomePod, which hearkens back to Apple’s iPod—a device that has always been focused almost exclusively on tunes. “Just like we did with portable music, we want to reinvent home music,” CEO Tim Cook said. Second, when Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing, came back to the stage to present the device, he spent much of his time highlighting how well it plays music—explaining the minutiae of its built-in tweeters and woofer. He also singled out its ability to figure out the acoustics of the room it’s in, and optimize the sound accordingly. Finally, when talking about its ability to use Siri, he explained most in depth how the assistant can help with a range of music-related HomePod commands like “Play something more mellow” or questions like “Who’s playing drums on this track?” These types of music-related capabilities are limited to Apple Music subscribers, though; if you don't want to pay a monthly fee, Siri won't be able to help you here.  Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.

I’m curious about tech innovation, and I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing. Before… More arriving at MIT Technology Review in early 2012, I spent five years as a technology reporter at the Associated Press, covering companies including Apple, Amazon, and eBay, and penning reviews. I’ve also worked as a freelancer, covering both technology and crime for the New York Times. I grew up mostly in Palo Alto, California, where companies like Hewlett-Packard and Google were simply a part of everyday life. But I didn’t discover my love for tech coverage until 2003. That’s when I accidentally discovered a major security lapse in Palo Alto Unified School District’s wireless network, which allowed anyone with Wi-Fi to view sensitive student information, including psychological profiles identified with full names. When not hard at work on a MIT Technology Review story, I can be found cycling around the Bay Area. READ COMMENTS Please read our commenting guidelines.

Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company's Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. Here are the highlights: ___ SIRI-POWERED SPEAKER An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple's Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. ___ A NEW, SMARTER SIRI With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and centre. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. ___ ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker's always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple's servers until you say, "Hey, Siri." The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon's Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won't know who you are — it'll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. ___ A DIFFERENT REALITY Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come "as the technology hits an inflection point." Apple's new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change that. ___ NEW HARDWARE Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. ___ UPDATES FOR THE IPHONE AND IPAD With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new "do not disturb" mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Apple Inc.

New updates to the itslearning learning management system (LMS) will make it even easier for K-12 teachers to assess and grade their students during the 2017-18 school year. Among the LMS’ enhancements is a streamlined grading workflow, a new capacity for annotating student submissions online and the ability to easily see students’ assignment status, to search and share assessment activities, and to deliver tests and see grades on any device. “Our goal is to provide the best integrated grading and assessment experience for teachers and students, alike,” said Arne Bergby, CEO of itslearning. “For students, we know the importance of staying connected to their results and outcomes of school work. So now we’ve made it a one-stop shop where they’ll be able to check their grades from any device they choose. For teachers, we were determined to make it easier to complete their assessment and grading tasks so they can spend more time teaching.” The updated grade book features enhanced data entry and it provides greater ease of use on mobile devices such as tablets. When an assignment or task deadline passes without a submittal from a student, that individual entry in the grade book will automatically become shaded red so teachers can see what’s overdue at a glance. itslearning will also allow teachers to use their browser to annotate student submissions in common file types such as MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint as well as Google Sheets, Google Docs and Google Slides. This new annotation capability will simplify the feedback process, allowing for detailed and personalized feedback. The LMS’ new assignment tool will be the fastest and easiest way to submit, view and grade student work. It will allow students to submit assignments via a cloud service such as Google Drive or OneDrive, which means that they will be able to submit an assignment, or even take a test, on any device of their choosing. The tool also will enable teachers to quickly and easily see which students have or have not completed assigned work. In addition, teachers will be able to search and share assignments, tests and third party assessments via the itslearning library. Educators can even search for assessments by standards. A new, shareable and easy-to-use test tool will allow students to take assessments on all devices and screen sizes. “Teachers can let students take a test on their phone in class and immediately see the results so they’ll know whether they need to spend some additional instruction time against the subject matter and when they can safely move on,” said Bergby. The added assessment and grading features are just the latest enhancements itslearning has announced. In April, the company introduced market-leading integrations to the world’s most popular cloud apps giving users the ability to work in Excel, Word and PowerPoint directly from within itslearning, without the need for a Microsoft email account or for any user information to be shared with Microsoft. In May, the LMS enhanced its mobile app, giving K-12 students and their teachers the full LMS experience even when they’re on the go. District administrators, teachers and students are now able to access course content, resources and tools on their Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Additionally, students can use the app to submit assignments and attach files.

The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal . Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino ' s Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers ' lives better , such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases."

About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

The HomePod speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7-inch model couldn’t, yet isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple is updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It has enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch.

But Indian tech news site Gadgets360 reports that Amazon may take another crack at smartphone hardware. So how would the company’s new phone or phones be different? If the first was Fire, the new models are “Ice.” Seriously, that’s allegedly the code name. It’s best to take the report with a grain of salt though. Amazon hasn’t officially confirmed any plans, and the new Ice phone strategy is very different from the one Amazon uses to sell tablets, Kindles, TV boxes, and other hardware… although there are also some reasons the Amazon Ice phone concept sounds plausible. Amazon Fire Phone Amazon sells Kindles, Fire Tablets, and other hardware at reasonably low prices in order to get customers hooked into the Amazon ecosystem. Have a Kindle? You’re more likely to buy eBooks from Amazon. Have a Fire TV? Then it’d almost be silly for you not to sign up for Amazon Prime to stream movies, TV shows, and music. So it’s no surprise that the original Fire Phone shipped with Fire OS, a custom build of Android that also runs on Amazon’s Fire tablets. But without access to services such as Google Maps, Google Assistant (or its predecessor, Voice Search), and other apps and features that users might expect, the Fire Phone was a tough sell. More recently, Amazon has taken a different approach to the smartphone space: in the US, the company has partnered with smartphone makers including Motorola, BLU, and Alcatel to offer “Prime Exclusive” variants of some phones. When you buy one of these special edition smartphones you save $50 off the list price… and get a device with lock screen ads and a suite of Amazon apps pre-installed. That approach gets Amazon’s apps and services in front of users, without requiring a huge investment on hardware. And users arguably get the best of both worlds, since the phones also feature Google’s apps, services, and the Google Play Store. So… what does this all have to do with the alleged Amazon Ice phone? According to Gadgets360, instead of partnering with third-party phone makers in India and other developing markets, Amazon seems to be developing its own low-cost phone. That sort of makes sense. There are already some dirt-cheap phones made for developing markets. Some are distinctly better than others though, and there’s certainly still an opportunity for Amazon (or any other company) to make a name for itself by offering a high-quality budget phone that offers a better user experience than you’d expect in that price range. Markets where people don’t already have a lot of brand loyalty to long-time phone makers might also seem appealing. So while it’s unlikely that Amazon would try to sell a branded phone in the US or other developed markets after the failure of the Fire Phone, it wouldn’t be surprising to see some first-party hardware from the company in emerging markets, offering the same kind of Google + Amazon software experience we already see on Prime Exclusive phones in the US.

Typically MVNOs make their profit by forcing people to update their phone every 30 to 90 days regardless of whether they need more minutes or not. Amazon could offer unlimited time frames for Prime members. I know for my father that would make Amazon Prime a no-brainer. Like many elderly people he likes to have the cell phone but doesn’t use it that much. He has to update regularly though to keep it active so he has like a few thousand minutes he will never use. And it costs him about $80/year to do that. Getting Amazon Prime instead and updating only when he needs minutes would not cost him much more and he’d get the other Prime benefits. As with most Prime gimmies, Amazon would make their money due to the fact that Prime members… Read more » Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 2 days 22 hours ago Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

For anyone who handled the thing, it’s a sturdy device, quick as heck vs. most Android phones at the time with most that you’d want or need at your fingertips. You didn’t NEED Google services, really, as there are plenty alternatives out there. Personally I feel the phone failed because of the exclusivity deal with ATT. Apple can manage to do exclusivity deals because they already have a huge, loyal fanbase. Google got away with it with the Pixel phones because they weren’t truly exclusive, they were just sold hand-to-hand through Verizon. Anyone could still buy them through/from Google directly, unlocked. The Fire phone was only offered, locked to ATT’s network. I feel that a phone offered by/through Amazon should be unlocked and either available through all carriers or just through Amazon. Whether it comes with Google services or not… Read more » Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 1 day 23 hours ago Guest Peter Lowe Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

If they still can’t figure out how to sell 7 inch Fire tablets in Canada, I don’t know how the heck they think they can sell a phone in China or Brazil.

provided by Kantar Millward Brown 06 Jun, 2017, 00:01 BST Share this article LONDON, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The technology giants Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook take the Top 5 places in the 2017 BrandZTM Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown.      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/513554/Kantar_Millward_Brown_Logo.jpg ) Amazon achieved the highest dollar value growth of all brands in the Top 100 ranking, increasing by $40.3 billion (+41%) to $139.3bn to take the no. 4 position. The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal. Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino's Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers' lives better, such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases."

About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

(KTRK) AP Monday, June 05, 2017 05:57PM Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Report a typo to the ABC13 staff Report a Typo Related Topics: technologyappleapple watchiPad Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 by The Associated Press.

(Apple) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn & Mike Murphy June 05, 2017 Apple’s annual developer conference felt especially like a show for consumers this year, with announcements of seven laptop updates, a new iMac Pro desktop computer, a new iPad, and a new home smart speaker called the HomePod. But Apple also had something for developers: new versions of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Apple computers, which will be available to consumers this Fall. Augmented reality, a theme of recent Google I/O and Facebook F8 developer conferences, also made an appearance on the San Jose stage. Apple spent significant time talking and demoing its ARKit, a set of tools for developers to use the iPhone and iPad camera lenses to overlay digital objects on the world, like in the popular mobile game Pokémon Go. However, the coming changes announced today that might be most important to users are things Apple didn’t talk talk about. Based on a presentation slide shown onstage but not discussed by company reps, the new iOS 11 will bring a slew of little changes meant to make life easier, like a one-handed keyboard for little thumbs reaching across gargantuan screens, and easier wi-fi sharing. Here’s a rundown of all the news. HomePod The HomePod, with Siri. (Apple) Apple unveiled its answer to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home: a squat, 7-inch speaker called the HomePod. The fabric-covered smart speaker can do pretty much everything an Echo or Home can do, from controlling internet-of-things devices, to playing music, providing updates on your calendar, and answering general questions. You control it by talking to Siri, Apple’s digital assistant (who isn’t known for consistently providing the most reliable of responses). The HomePod features seven tweeters and a 4-inch woofer that Apple suggests will provide sound that will “rock the house.” The device comes in black or white, and will be available in December for $349—or about $200 more than Amazon and Google’s costliest speaker models, for roughly the same functionality. New iPads For a while now, Apple has been trying to convince us that, for the average person, the iPad is a worthy replacement for a laptop. After today’s announcements, that may finally be true. Apple debuted a new version of its massive 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new 10.5-inch model with smaller bezels. Both feature brighter screens and faster processors. But what really sets them apart is the new software they’ll come with: iOS 11, the next iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system, expected to launch in the autumn. Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro running the forthcoming iOS 11 software. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) A new app called Files gives iPad users access to all the files on their device in one place, so you can actually find photos to attach to a tweet, or a spreadsheet to add to an email. You can even drag and drop files right from one window to another, just like you would on a computer. You can float apps as windows from the iPad’s dock, or have them in split-screen, giving the iPad the feel of something you might actually be able to put into a bag and feel confident taking with you instead of a laptop—assuming you purchase an Apple Pencil and keyboard case to go with it, of course. The new iPads start at $649 (for the 10.5-inch) and $799 (for the 12.9-inch), and are available today. Apple expects them to start shipping next week. iMac Pro There’s a new Mac in town. Apple previewed the iMac Pro, a new version of its iMac desktop that only comes in its “space grey” color. Other than its more aggressive coloring, it also features some powerful innards: It can hold up to a 4 TB solid-state hard drive, 128 GB of memory, as well as run two 5K monitors and two RAID data storage arrays at once. The iMac has its own 27-inch 5K screen and a new cooling system that Apple says can run 80% cooler than its other iMacs, allowing it to run far more efficiently. The super-powered iMac Pro starts at $4,999, and will be available in December. Making sure the iMac Pro looks just right. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) New Macs and MacBooks On top of the new iMac Pro, Apple refreshed just about its entire line of Macs today. The MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops received new processors, featuring Intel’s new “Kaby Lake” processors, with speeds up to 3.5 GHz. Its non-Pro iMacs also got some upgrades: New iMacs will also feature Intel’s new processors, as well as faster hard drives, new graphics cards, brighter screens, and a new Thunderbolt 3 port. Both the iMacs, the new MacBook, and MacBook Pros will all start at $1,299, and are available today. Apple also revived its long-sidelined MacBook Air, upgrading it to a slightly more powerful 1.8 GHz processor. But the Air still doesn’t have a HD Retina display—like every other Mac computer. VR on Macs One of the more surprising announcements at the convention was that Apple is now working to support virtual reality systems on its computers. Onstage, a team from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the special-effects arm of Lucasfilm (the company behind Star Wars), showed a demonstration of Darth Vader roving around a lava planet breathing dramatically while surveying some destroyed starships, running on an iMac through an HTC Vive VR headset connect. A video showed an ILM employee walking through the Star Wars planet as Darth Vader walked by her. After the keynote, journalists could try out the Vader demo, as well as a few games from the HTC Vive library. The experience felt no different than it did playing on a Windows computer. Apple even had VR headsets connected up to MacBook Pro laptops, which however did require an external graphics card to power the VR experience. There's actual demos of the HTC Vive running on Macs and I thought it was as neat as the Windows experience is #WWDC2017 pic.twitter.com/KqIyWv4qIu — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) June 5, 2017 While these demonstrations were just proofs of concept of what Apple systems could do with VR, they do suggest Apple is taking the medium more seriously and that more could be in store—especially when one considers that the primary audience of today’s keynote was the myriad developers who build games and apps for the company’s existing platforms. iOS The annual iOS update is here. (Apple) Perhaps the most impactful announcements Apple made today concerned iOS, its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads. Rather than redesigning the entire experience, Apple decided to change specific pieces of the software and add new features into existing platforms like iMessage and Siri. iPhone owners will now be able to use Apple Pay to transfer money between each other, much like the popular Venmo app. Of course, because Apple Pay requires a phone made by Apple, you won’t be able to easily send money to your friends who have a Google Pixel, which might still give Venmo an edge. Swiping up from the bottom of the iPhone screen will reveal a new Control Center, the bevy of buttons used to manipulate things like wireless connectivity, screen brightness, and music. The new Control Center is all on one screen, rather than a series of pages that the user swipes through. There is also a dedicated button for turning cellular signal on and off, great for the times when you don’t want to lose signal to Bluetooth headphones, like on an airplane. Best of all, it’s finally customizable, so you can create your shortcuts in your own image. Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, wasn’t neglected either. Apple says Siri will be in even more places on the phone, reading iMessages and browsing history to help predict when you want to see information, create events, or even type certain words. Siri can also now translate English to Chinese, French, German, and a few other languages. You’ll also be able to type messages to Siri—instead of just talking to it—making it so much more than just a voice assistant. On the iPad, iOS 11 will bring an entirely new app switcher and bottom dock (like the one on traditional Mac laptops), as well as a new file explorer app. Called Files (nice), the app attempts to turn the iPad into a viable work machine; trying to put files in a folder or work with a few files at once on an iPad was previously a Sisyphean task. It’s not really a iOS feature per se, but Apple is also redesigning its entire App Store for the first time since its creation. A new “Today” tab will emphasize recently released apps, and there’s a dedicated section for games. Then, as mentioned earlier, the final iOS 11 presentation slide revealed a slew of other features not discussed by Apple execs onstage—but that will significantly change the iPhone and iPad experience for most users. To name a few: There’s now one-handed typing, where holding down the emoji key on the virtual keyboard brings all the keys closer to your preferred thumb, making it easier to tap out messages while holding a coffee or crying baby. There’s also a new way to set up your iOS device: Just hold it near one of your old ones, and a new setup process will automatically import data from that device’s iCloud. macOS High Sierra MacOS has a new name: High Sierra. Apple made a significant tweak under the hood, changing the way files are constructed and stored into a different proprietary format. This will likely speed up some operations like copying files, but doesn’t really mean much for the average user. It will probably still be a nightmare to transfer large files between Mac and Windows environments. Other than the new file system, nothing groundbreaking is happening on MacOS. watchOS 4 Smarter notifications. (Apple) Is the fourth time the charm for the Apple Watch? Since the device launched in April 2015, Apple’s premiere wearable has had three complete iterations on its operating system. They just can’t seem to get it right. But that’s okay, because nobody really has—smartwatch software is generally terrible. Apple is trying a slightly different approach this time, with a Siri-backed watch face. Based on a variety of factors, like the time of day, amount exercised, and location, Siri will suggest information that you might want to see. Given Apple’s past problems with slow load times on the Watch, we’ll have to see whether this feature is quick enough to be actually useful. Other faces added include a kaleidoscope and Toy Story characters for some reason. The Workouts app is being overhauled for easier use, and Apple has partnered with gym equipment manufacturers so Watches can sync with them for better health data. But unless your gym changes its equipment every year on an Apple hardware cycle, you probably shouldn’t get too hyped about using this feature in coming months. Apple TV Amazon Prime Video is coming to Apple TV, and that’s about all Apple had to say about its streaming device. AR Kit Augmented reality is Silicon Valley’s buzzword du jour, dragged into the public eye by the insane popularity of Pokemon Go last year. If you’re not familiar, here’s the basic idea: you use your phone (or tablet) camera as an oracle to glimpse into a world where digital objects are laid over reality. A digital dog pees on your rug, but there is no stain afterwards. A cup of tea sits on your table but you cannot drink it. The idea is interesting, but in practice it feels silly to move around a tiny glass window in order to peek into a massive digital world that doesn’t do all that much. Following the trend— at Google’s I/O keynote the company also gave developers a group of augmented reality tools—Apple released AR Kit, tools for developers to build AR experiences for iOS devices. Where will iOS developers decide to put place digital teacups? That’s for us to find out, and personally we cannot wait.

Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before...

Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit.

I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag.

Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999.

Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson.

Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file.

HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote.

I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client.

Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over. Let it back them up while you're out and about. myssi Wondering how much it costs to Google to save all these bazillions of photos; that too for an app which earns $0. Leroy Filon 132.068 photos.

Rosh Mathew This is for people who have 40,000 photos synced. Do you ever get the feeling that - OK IM KINDA GETTING TIRED OF SNAPPING AWAY DURING A VACATION THAN ACTUALLY ENJOYING the moment? Years later, that foggy feeling that I spent so much time taking photos that I don't remember the vacation at all? And when you do have some time to sit down and reminisce, going through thousands of snaps feels exhausting, and there is too much emphasis on quantity of snaps than QUALITY? (I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

Bruce Wayne From Fire to Ice. Not so subtle. Daniel 'Cause when Amazon made their last phone, all they did was get burned. XD NexusKoolaid And what did they do with all those unsold Fire phones they had stockpiled? They put 'em on ice. Daniel And what a bummer for them; they really had a burning desire to sell a bunch of them NexusKoolaid But in the end, they just decided to chill out. Daniel Bet you don't get these kind of comments on other websites. lol 4Ui812 She's sun and rain , She's fire and ice , a little crazy but it's nice , and when she gets mad best to leave her alone Daniel "You leave my wife outta this" -Jeff Bezos talking about his phone Lord Argyris Maybe they just like Pokemon? I expect they'll chain as many types that are super effective on the next in line as possible. Expect Flying, Bug and Psychic phones in the coming years. Or Dragon, Dragon, Dragon... MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up. Still, that was a long break that it took. The naming scheme is not bad but still kind of funny. Paul Monroe, Jr. Now if they could just do that with the fire tablets they might actually have something going on..

[Deal Alert] Get a $75 credit when spending $750 or more on a Pixel with Google Store Financing Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 8:04am PDTJun 5, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 25 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Deals Google Pixel Pixel XL The Pixel is a great phone, but it's not sold by most carriers. Google make it a little easier to afford this device by making financing available. It's rare that Google discounts devices on the Google Store, but you can get $75 off a Pixel right now if you use financing. There are some caveats, but not as many as most carrier deals. The deal requires you to spend at least $750—the Pixel XL would certainly fulfill that, but a 128GB regular Pixel should work too. Hey, or you could just buy a few Pixels. Your call. Just sign up for Google Store Financing and keep your account in good standing. After two billing cycles, you'll get an account credit for $75. This deal also entitles you to the free Pixel case, which Google started a week or two ago. The Pixel is getting a bit old, and maybe you shouldn't hop on that train anymore. Still, this is a good deal. Source: Google Store Tags deals Google google store pixel pixel xl subscribe ...

I'll stick to the essentials Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Watch out, Spigen might sue you! Aaron With the LCD display, lack of waterproofing and ugly screen mounted selfie can, I'm really not seeing any essential for me. Rawhi Mohammad Good points.. to be honest, I'm looking forward to the uglycam, waterproofing yes, that would have been nice. LCD.. that might suck, I'm used to my AMOLED. But it won't hurt to try it out and see for myself. Aaron Hey I'm definitely not angry about another premium vendor on the market. And there's a lot to be excited about here. But about like the first gen Pixels, I was hoping for a little more. Rawhi Mohammad Definitely agree.. they could've justified it's price by tackling all these points. Wonder if anyone ever will BinaryTB Maybe if it was a Pixel C, who knows if Google will announce another tablet, so might as well get the only pure Android tablet currently available. T4rd New battery definitely revived my 6P. Went from this with early shutdowns at 10-30%: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e2cf19817b113fda177a0371891906cc98537e17585ef51f9862d7c355c8837.png To this with 4-5 hours SoT again and no early shutdowns: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d935df6962acf507febc9d3ee4bb9a7deb1c8c5b91fe814c91768238d96f1966.png Edit: Opps, replied to wrong comment, hah. But I see Edgar replied anyways below. Edgar Martin Hope it fixes mine also. Two more days until I get a new battery. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4c60dbd62abb2ed4ae54165974d0fe71c8b31a84df4ffa732379c98e1a7b3d6a.png T4rd Damn, that's pretty bad. So does it really only last like 1 hour of SoT then? lol Edgar Martin If that. Lol. It's on the charger most of the time. ☹️ Jay That's really bad. 😮 Tom Z Here's how bad mine has gotten. I just purchased a Nexus 5x from Newegg to hold me over until the Pixel 2 arrives. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ebfe8d90329e8d0be031b0030b1000ba8c797240fb1238e0ce206802427b2b5a.png T4rd Wow.. you know Google is replacing 6Ps out of warranty because of this, right? Or you could have just got that $10 6P battery I posted below and had a local repair place put it in for you for much less than that 5X costs. Jason Pagliaro Mine went into the reboot loop of death this weekend, sadly. Battery was getting bad but no early shutdowns, at least. TheDrunkenClam Is it easy to do this replacement? Plombir It's not easy for sure plus you need tools as well. I will just get a battery and take my phone to a reputable shop to get it installed. asianrage Most likely, get a replacement back and glass and such. The chance of damaging that visor is very high. T4rd It's not hard IMO, but I've had a bit of experience repairing phones, tablets, and other electronics too and it does require some basic phone repair tools; heat gun/blow dryer, plastic wedges/guitar picks, super thin metal pry tool or x-acto knife, and a small screw driver. Most phone parts come with most of these tools (my battery from eBay did), but I've acquired many from past repairs I've done. I replace the battery in my previous One M8 too, which was considerably harder than this 6P since you had to completely disassemble the phone sans the display to get to it. Fortunately on the 6P, once you get the housing off, the battery is easy to get to and replace from there. The hardest part on this phone is removing the bottom plastic panel and top glass without damaging anything (much). So it's important to have a super thin knife or tool to pry these pieces out.. I had to make due with a box cutter blade and got it off with minimal damage to the housing. Anfronie I'm thinking of doing this soon. Where can I get an reputable OEM battery that is not a knockoff? I don't want to do all that work if the replacement battery is crap. Thanks for any info! T4rd I got this one: http://www.ebay.com/itm/252482757101?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT Looked EXACTLY like the original OEM battery and a few others in this Reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/66tzgh/if_youre_on_the_fence_about_replacing_your/#bottom-comments) bought that one as well with the same results as I have had. You can see pics of it there too next to the original battery. Anfronie Thanks a ton for the info! :D John Doe Google sent me a 15% discount "just for you" off of the Pixel XL. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6e48720cee18cef32533cfd87278a84f7cb2d33eb3bdfa5289ad659e1c1908.png Good_Ole_Pinocchio You didn't use it did you? John Doe No of course not LoL Edgar Martin Hopefully getting the battery replaced in my Nexus 6P this Wednesday will allow me to hold off until the next Pixel is release... If not then Pixel XL it is. T4rd It's annoying that Google refuses to discount their Pixel devices. The Pixel C is now a major rip-off at $600 and almost 2 years old. Makes you wonder if or how much they'll discount the current Pixel phones when the new ones come out. I'm guess they'll take a generous $100 off their current prices, lol. Good_Ole_Pinocchio They won't... they'll just replace them with the New Pixel. T4rd Probably.. which would be for the best considering they still can't even keep stock of them now, let alone when they're superseded. Jason Pagliaro And use the remaining inventory for warranty replacements. Cael What inventory? Jason Pagliaro Everything except the 5" black seem to be in stock unless I'm missing something. Chris G Hope they bring the financing option to Canada this year with the pixel 2. exzacklyright Pixel 2 tho... Might as well wait JG Yeah... Too bad they probably won't let us open a financing account now and start paying ahead for the Pixel 2... Get the $75 credit in August... Have half (or a fourth, depending if you do 1 or 2yrs) of the Pixel 2 paid off by the time it's released... Would result in less of a sting to the check book, especially Taimen turns out to be a tablet, about time to replace my Nexus 9... me me oooh I so need to spend $750. Cowboydroid Sad, Google. Just sad. James Briano Boss to Johnson: "I want you to handle all the Pixel sales. ALL the Pixel sales!" Johnson to his broker: "Put all my money in Samsung. ALL my money." Badouken Just need my 6P to last til end of October for the Pixel 2 to release! atc-tech Lol... "DEAL!" yeah.... Bruce Wayne Lol. $750 on a Pixel. abc $750 for a year old phone that was overpriced to start with. Ridiculous. Testraindrop Deal Alert? Spending 750$ or more for a Pixel? Now? Why? There are so many alternatives. D.Smithee lol--$750 or more on a Pixel. Never gonna happen. WAY overpriced. Ray $1400+ here in a Australia for a 128gb XL. Absolute fraud I tell you. As much I would be willing to buy one now, it would need to be half that before I'd even consider it.

The data was collected during a 7-day period that ended on June 5, and it only represents devices that have visited the Google Play Store during that period, so to be clear, it does not include AOSP devices. Version Codename API Last month This month Change 2.3.3 - 2.3.7 Gingerbread 10 1.0% 0.8% -0.2 4.0.3 - 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich 15 0.8% 0.8% - 4.1.x Jelly Bean 16 3.2% 3.1% -0.1 4.2.x 17 4.6% 4.4% -0.2 4.3 18 1.3% 1.3% - 4.4 KitKat 19 18.8% 18.1% -0.7 5.0 Lollipop 21 8.7% 8.2% -0.5 5.1 22 23.3% 22.6% -0.7 6.0 Marshmallow 23 31.2% 31.2% - 7.0 Nougat 24 6.6% 8.9% 2.3 7.1 25 0.5% 0.6% 0.1 The biggest gain this month is obviously Android 7.0 Nougat, which got a 34.8% increase from last month to 8.9%. It's not exactly worth bragging about though, since it was released nearly ten months ago. But while Nougat is seeing strong momentum (as far as Android versions go), 7.1 is not. Nearly seven months old, it's still on only 0.6% of Google Play devices. Marshmallow saw its first decline (of just 0.1) back in April, and has remained stagnant at 31.2% since. The declines in Lollipop bring it down to a total of 30.8%, making this the first month where Marshmallow is more popular than the combination of 5.0 and 5.1. Jelly Bean and KitKat are continuing to decline steadily. Of course, this is normal for aging versions of the OS that used to have larger usage shares. Ice Cream Sandwich is stagnant, which isn't surprising given its already-low share. Gingerbread is continuing to bounce around the 1% mark, this time dropping to 0.8% after an increase last month.

It sits in your house, ready to do your bidding when you issue voice instructions. Google Home can answer questions, inform you about the weather, play music from Spotify, and much more besides. Canadians can now preorder Google’s smart home speaker from Google’s online store or Best Buy. Google itself is suggesting a vague release date of “2-3 weeks”. However, Best Buy suggests Google Home will arrive in Canadian stores on June 26. So we’ll assume that date is correct. Google Home will set Canadian buyers back $179 CAD. Which puts it on a par with the U.S, price. If you preorder, Best Buy will throw in a Chromecast for free. However, Google Home will also be available from Bell, Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Telus, Staples, The Source, and Walmart. Google Capitalizes on Amazon’s Laziness Google is taking an aggressive approach to getting Home in as many homes as possible.

WWDC is traditionally the place where Apple shows off improvements to the software that powers its devices, rather than hardware revisions or brand new machines. But with the company feeling pressure from rivals in the home computer and laptop spaces — and with many of its Mac lines having languished without significant updates for quite a while — many analysts were tipping an uncharacteristically hardware-heavy show, and that's exactly what we got.

Hello HomePod As expected, Apple is introducing a smart speaker to compete with Google's Home and Amazon's Echo. The HomePod, Apple says, is a wireless speaker that uses "spatial awareness" to adjust its output to the shape of its surroundings. Designed to pair with an iPhone and play music via a user's Apple Music subscription, the device will also field queries and control other smart home devices thanks to Siri integration. The speaker features an upward-facing woofer, seven tweeters each with dedicated amps and a six-microphone array. The HomePod will launch in Australia in December, although a price is yet to be announced. In the US it will cost $US349 ($466), more than twice the price of its Google competitor. Advertisement iMacs and MacBooks updated, Mac Pro re-imagined While whispers of a touch-enabled Mac line that would open the door to more versatile Apple machines turned out to be baseless, Apple is significantly updating several of its existing products with modern components, as well as introducing a new turbo-charged iMac. The iMac Pro blends the super-thin design of the standard Apple all-in-one with the bleeding-edge productivity focus of the old Mac Pro, packing enough power to handle high-end tasks like 3D modelling for VR. The increased power means Apple needed to craft a new kind of cooling mechanism to keep the components' temperatures lowered in the skinny enclosure. The dark grey computer sports a 27-inch, 5K display and will start at $US4999 ($6676) in the US. So far there is no word on international pricing, and no indication of what the most powerful iteration of the device — with 18-core Xeon processors, a Radeon Pro Vega GPU with 16GB of VRAM and a 4TB SSD hard drive — will cost. For regular folks who don't need a computer that can handle artificial intelligence research, the iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro have all been brought up to date with new Intel Kaby Lake processors. The iMac now features Thunderbolt 3 ports and, in most models, dedicated graphics chips. At the low end there is still a 21.5-inch iMac with a 2.3GHz processor and a 1080p display, starting at $1599. More powerful 21.5-inch models with 4K screens start at $1899, and 27-inch models with 5K screens start at $2699. Meanwhile the 12-inch Macbook has faster hard drives and now supports up to 16GB of memory, while the 13-inch Pro has a new entry-level model that comes in at $1899. The 15-inch Pro, which starts at $3499, now comes with a more powerful AMD graphics chip with either 2GB or 4GB of memory. The new iMacs, MacBooks and MacBook Pros are all available for order now. iPad Pro gets a refresh Despite ever-shrinking sales, Apple announced a refresh for its line of high-end tablets. The iPad Pro now comes in an all-new 10.5-inch variation in addition to the original 12.9-inch size. The previously available 9.7-inch Pro appears to have been put out to pasture, presumably to avoid confusion with the standard non-Pro iPad, which is the same size. The 10.5-inch Pro has some impressively skinny bezels and weighs in at a tiny 469 grams. Both models feature an improved processor and something Apple calls "ProMotion", which essentially means the screens are now capable of higher refresh rates for smoother video and animations. The new iPad Pro starts at $979 and $1199 for the smaller and larger models respectively. The standard iPad and iPad Mini 4 remain unchanged. First look at iOS 11, MacOS High Sierra and WatchOS updates While the iPhone was largely absent from the announcements at WWDC, Apple did give a sneak peek into the future of the device with the unveiling of a new version of iOS, which also powers its iPads. New in iOS 11 will be a better camera app, a more capable Apple Pay system, a new version of Apple Maps with indoor mapping and a new toolkit to help developers bring augmented reality features to their apps. On iPad Pro, a redesigned app switcher and customisable dock gives the operating system a flatter, more modern look. The new software also contains a "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode, which Apple says will help prevent iPhones distracting those behind the wheel, and a new "Files" app that resembles a traditional computer file system for viewing and organising documents. On the Mac front, Apple showed off High Sierra, the next version of MacOS. The update includes refinements to Photos and enhanced ad-blocking features for Safari. Most improvements will be under the hood, including an all-new file system, VR features and support for the new HEVC video standard. Finally, the company previewed some improvements coming to the Apple Watch. A new Siri watchface predicts what you'll want to see when you look at your wrist, while improvements to the device's fitness features will let you track new types of high-intensity workouts.

Instead get one of these best printers for Chromebook. Chromebooks are great for a lot of things, whether it’s writing a paper or browsing the web without worrying about getting infected with malware. But how do you know which is the best printer for Chromebook in 2017? Chromebooks, for all the things they do well, can also be notoriously fickle when it comes to drivers and recognizing third-party hardware without a heap of extra hair-pulling on the side. For our best of list, first and foremost we looked at printers that are known in the industry for being immediately compatible with Chromebooks using the Google Cloud Print service, as well as how quickly and quietly they can get your photos and documents printed out. All these factors in mind, the HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile is our #1 pick, not only for its performance, but also its extreme versatility and mobility options thanks to an onboard battery which keeps it chugging along even if there’s no power outlet to be seen. But there’s plenty more models in the running for the top spot, so make sure to read on in our guide to the best printers for Chromebook to find out who made the cut! Best Printer for Chromebook Comparison Chart   HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile Canon PIXMA MG7720 HP Envy 4520 Rank #1 - Editor's Choice #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating Printing Technology Inkjet Inkjet Inkjet Printing Speed (B&W/Color) 20ppm/19ppm 15ipm/10ipm 20ppm/16ppm Display Screen Scan Resolution N/A N/A 1200 dpi Borderless Printing? Dimensions 7.3 x 14.3 x 2.7 inches 14.6 x 17.2 x 5.9 inches 17.52 x 14.45 x 5.04 inches Weight 4.8 lbs 17.5 lbs 11.93 lbs Check Price Check Price Check Price How We Choose Because the list of printers that are actually compatible with Chromebooks is so small, it wasn’t too difficult of a task to find the best of the best from that short roster. On the whole, we wanted to keep the features and price point in line with what the average Chromebook user can understand and afford, so simplicity and low-cost were the primary focus when making our selections. The best printer for a Chromebook should at the very least have Google Cloud Print compatibility (to wirelessly connect to your laptop), as well as the option to print both in monochromatic and color without any major settings changes. Although the addition scanner would be nice, this extra functionality can sometimes add extra dollars to the final cost, something you want to avoid since Chromebooks are generally considered a budget laptop pick for buyers who are trying to watch their wallet (though the Canon still sports one at a decent price). Ultimately, we chose three printers that can either be plugged in/recognized by a Chromebook and connect wirelessly if you need it, while also printing quality pictures or text at high speeds. The best printers for Chromebooks offer combination of all these different features in a single package, and won’t cost you (or your budding college student) an arm and a leg to maintain over time. Who Should Buy a Chromebook Printer As more users wake up to the notion that you don’t only have to choose from a Windows or OSX machine to get work done on the road (or heaven forbid, Linux), Chrome OS is quickly becoming the alternative option for people who need a cheap, functional laptop that just does what you need it to every step of the way. Unfortunately, all that simplicity doesn’t always translate between other devices, printers especially so. Whether you’ve just bought your first Chromebook or have been using the platform since it was released, printing is something that all of us need to do at least once in awhile, if not every day. As paperless as things are nowadays, there are still plenty of tasks that require you to print something out on a physical page, which is why it’s important to find a printer that’s seamlessly compatible with your Chromebook or any other laptop/desktop in your house. #1 Pick HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile Printer/Editor’s Choice The HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile printer lets you print off your Chromebook from anywhere Price: $99 | Read Full Review: [EDIT: Posted later this week] Features: Onboard battery for mobile printing, 20ppm black/white printing, borderless printing WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP MobileJet OfficeJet 200 lets you take your Chromebook printing on the go thanks to its onboard battery.  The HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile Printer is one of the latest to join the company’s oldest and most widely recognized brands in the world of printers, updated with a slew of new features that brings printing into the 21st century. Wireless printing has been around for awhile now, but the HP OfficeJet 200 really lives up to its wireless/mobile name thanks to an onboard battery, which can be charged up so you don’t need to be near a plug in order to print out that emergency term paper or tax document from the road. In our testing, we found that on a full charge the OfficeJet was able to push out around 75 printed pages before running out of battery. This should be more than enough to satisfy any mobile professional or college student between plugins, especially when you consider those prints happened at speeds much faster than what you’d get from a competing printer that’s actually plugged into its own power source. The HP OfficeJet 200 is compatible both wirelessly as a part of Google’s Cloud-Ready network of printers, and also happens to be one of the few that Chrome OS has drivers for and can recognize upon being plugged directly into the USB port of a Chromebook (if you decide to go the wired-only route instead). The HP OfficeJet 200 may be the priciest option of the three, but it compensates for that cost by sporting the fastest and highest quality prints on this list, earning it the number one spot for the best printers for Chromebook in 2016. View on Amazon #2 Pick  Canon PIXMA MG7720 The Canon MG7720 is a wireless printing monster thanks to its compatibility with so many different platforms Price: $106.00 | Features: Five wireless printing connectivity choices, four color options WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Canon PIXMA MG7720 is a solid pick for multiple-OS households.  While the Canon PIXMA MG7720 may not be as mobile or immediately intuitive to the amateur Chromebook user as the OfficeJet 200, its low cost and extensive wireless compatibility options made it a must-have in our book. If you’re in a household that runs as many different platforms as there are separate devices, you might want to consider the MG7720 as your next printer. With the ability to connect via Air Print, Google Cloud Print, through NFC or even the Canon PRINT app from your phone, the MG7720 is the Swiss Army Knife of printers, connecting to Windows, OSX, or Chrome OS in seconds. Thanks to the onboard 3.5-inch touchscreen, all the necessary configuration to get these different systems working together in tandem can happen in the same place, removing the need to download separate drivers for separate machines depending on which machine you’re trying to print from at the time. Plus it also comes in an all-gold chassis, if showing off your printing skills is more your style. View on Amazon #3 Pick HP Envy 4520 Mobile Printer The HP Envy 420 is a cheaper Chromebook printing alternative to premium options like the OfficeJet 200 Price: $78.70 | Features: Google Cloud Print-ready, HP Instant Ink delivery, edge-to-edge printing WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Edge-to-edge printing makes the Envy 4520 a perfect pick for photo-obsessed enthusiasts.  Like the Canon, the HP Envy 4520 comes with a number of different wireless connectivity formats to choose from, including Google Cloud Print. Unlike the Canon, however, the Envy is the only printer on this list that lets you print on both sides of a single page, saving you time and up to 50% on your next paper purchase! Cooler still, the Envy 4520 also comes equipped with HP’s proprietary HP Instant Ink system, which will automatically order new ink cartridges straight to your door whenever the printer detects it’s starting to run low. This means no more late-night trips to Staples, aimlessly wandering the aisles looking for the right cartridge so your kid can get their book report printed before tomorrow morning. It’s also one of the only printers at this price range (sub-$100) that gives you the option for edge-to-edge printing. This feature is perfect for photos, as it lets you print them out on the full stock without having to worry about trimming off the edges later. If you want a fast, cheap, and easy-to-operate photo printer for your Chromebook, look no further than the HP 4520. View on Amazon  Features to Look for in the Best Printer for Chomebook Google Cloud Print-ready: This is the big one. Since most Chromebooks don’t have the ability to recognize third-party drivers, Chrome OS instead uses what’s known as “Google Cloud Print” to connect the printer wirelessly to your laptop. You can check Google’s full list of compatible printers found here. Color printing: This may sound redundant, but not all printers in 2016 automatically come with color printing as a default. Be sure that you’re buying a printer that does the job you need it to, especially if you plan on printing lots of photos or presentations that need all the color they can get. Print speed: How fast a printer can push out the pages is registered on a metric known as “PPM”, or “pages per minute”. On average, you should look for a printer that can do at least 20ppm for black and white content, while the acceptable range for color printing starts around 16ppm. Mistakes to Avoid Buying monochromatic on accident: If you see a printer that’s Cloud-ready, has tons of extra features (scanner, fax, etc), and is also being offered up at a suspiciously low price – chances are you’re accidentally looking at a monochromatic printer, not color. Monochromatic printers are generally much cheaper than color printers, but also only print in black and white. If you don’t need your printer for anything except shipping labels or text documents this should be fine, but if you ever want to upgrade to printing photos or color pictures, you’ll have to buy a whole new unit instead. Skimping on ink quality: Look, no one likes spending half a house payment on ink cartridges every time they start to run dry, but the best way you can ensure you get every last drop out of your current cartridge is to spend on quality first. Certified cartridges from HP and Canon both last significantly longer than generic cartridges, and will always look better than generic when printing details in larger photos or illustrations. Which Best Printer for Chromebook Is Right For You? The best printer for Chromebooks may not necessarily be the best for every operating system, but it’s the kind of compatibility and flexibility you find in models like the HP OfficeJet Mobile 200 that really sets them apart. Overall these are cheap printers that can still print quality photos using Google’s Cloud Print platform, and don’t get tied up with overly-confusing configuration setups or six different ink cartridges designed to do ten different jobs. If you need something that’s great for students and road warriors, the OfficeJet 200 is the way to go. If you print a lot of photos from home, the HP Envy 4520 might be more up your alley, while the Canon MG7720 is a powerhouse that comes with a scanner and copier for just over $100 flat.

E.g., can’t use it with a Wifi hotspot. Can’t use it on someone else’s wifi that’s not set up for it. Which is completely ridiculous for a mobile laptop and portable printer. What good is that? So, there are some details about “Cloud Print” that aren’t mentioned, even in this article. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Elizabeth Dwoskin By Elizabeth Dwoskin June 5 Follow @lizzadwoskin Apple revealed a new smart speaker device, the HomePod, at WWDC. Here are some of its features. (Apple) SAN JOSE — In 2011, Apple became the first company to place artificial intelligence in the pockets of millions of consumers when it launched the voice assistant Siri on the iPhone. Six years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial-intelligence products is as fundamental to the company’s next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone of sleekly designed hardware and services. AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple’s rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn’t profile consumers. Moreover, Apple’s long-standing penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country’s top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. “Artificial intelligence is not in Apple’s DNA,” said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Gene Munster. “They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot.” At Apple’s annual developers conference Monday — the same event where Siri was introduced — the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new stand-alone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri’s chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. “Machine learning” — an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultra-fast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling — was repeated throughout the 2½-hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute, or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company’s Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, the HomePod. She will automatically organize your photos into albums, such as “2nd Anniversary,” without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software tool kit, Core ML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It’s six times as fast as Google’s rival AI processor, an executive quipped.) But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence — software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind — and where the effort cuts against core aspects of the company’s secretive culture. “This is a substantial shift for Apple,” said Daniel Gross, a former Apple executive who focused on artificial intelligence. “The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers.” Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company’s revenue, which was $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company’s smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones may finally be saturated. “The difference between last year’s iPhone and this year’s iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. . . . So that S-curve is starting to flatten out,” said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. “Then you have the next transformative technology that isn’t here yet.” Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple’s launch of he HomePod, which will go on sale later this year, comes several years after Amazon.com and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers’ spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday’s updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified Web search that could tell the occasional preprogrammed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as “deep” or “unsupervised” learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain’s neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protege of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world’s top researcher in this area. Salakhutdinov divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple. Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products but also becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. “You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do,” Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper on artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was “off the scale” in terms of secrecy and that such secrecy was keeping it out of the loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino, Calif., giant was “making some changes.” “But it’s going to take some work,” he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates — Google, Facebook and Amazon were by far the top picks — but that the company was moving up in the rankings. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Apple’s forays into AI have also been slower than its peers' because it’s been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer’s conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Chief executive Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people’s speech to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise — or bad information — into good data to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn’t know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple’s focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. “Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science and doing so to try and preserve your privacy,” he said. “I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to a world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving.” Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. “The bad news is that Apple is behind,” he said. “The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it’s still early days — there is plenty of time to catch up.” Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced Siri eight years ago. It also misstated the first name of venture capitalist and Apple analyst Gene Munster.

Does it support multi-room audio? Does it work with Spotify? Show More Apple concluded its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday with a sneak peek of an all-new product: The HomePod.  Editor’s note: We’ve updated this story to include a full FAQ. Originally rumored to be called Siri Speaker, the HomePod is a smart speaker with Wi-Fi capabilities intended to compete against Amazon Echo devices and Google Home—although it will be significantly more expensive. During the WWDC keynote, Apple’s senior VP of marketing Phil Schiller boasted about the HomePod’s audio quality, its built-in room sensors, and the integration with Apple Music.  [ Further reading:The best home security cameras ] With its always-on voice assistant and ability to control connected devices, the HomePod is very similar to Echo devices and Google Home, but with a few notable differences. (We were able to get a closer look after the keynote, and you can check out our first eyes-on impressions here.) Here are the must-know HomePod features, specs, and sales info showcased during WWDC. Apple When’s the HomePod release date? The HomePod will be available for sale starting in December, initially in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. So it’s will only support English-language voice commands during the initial rollout. It will then be available in other countries starting in 2018. How much will it cost? The HomePod costs $349 and will be available in two colors: white and space grey. By comparison, Amazon Echo is $180 and Google Home retails for $129. Is the HomePod just as smart as the iPhone? The HomePod comes with an A8 fusion chip, the same one that powers the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. That definitely puts it up at the top when it comes to “smart” speakers. Like the AirPods (which sport an A1 chip), setting up the HomePod is just as easy and intuitive. All you have to do is hold your iPhone next to the HomePod and it’ll be ready to start playing music in seconds. Apple How do you activate it? The HomePod has six microphones so that it can be activated verbally using the “Hey Siri” voice command. We’re not sure what happens if you have “Hey Siri” activated on your nearby iPhone as well. Hopefully, Apple implements a way for you to customize which device responds and fulfills the voice commands, or for the iPhone and the HomePod to communicate with each other and figure it out. We’ll let you know once we do our full review. What can you ask Siri to do? You can ask Siri to send a text message to your friend, start playing the latest episode of your favorite podcast, and get the latest updates in news, sports, traffic, and weather. You can also use voice commands to set alarms, timers, and reminders. In addition, Siri on the HomePod can help you answer some of your most burning questions like, “What’s the best Korean barbecue restaurant nearby?” or “Did the Warriors win last night?” Does it have a touchscreen? No, the HomePod does not have a touchscreen like the more-recent Amazon Show, but it can still responds to touch controls. You can tap the top of HomePod to play, pause, or adjust the volume. This panel also animates with an LED waveform to indicate whenever Siri is listening. Roman Loyola Can it control HomeKit devices? Yes! You can ask Siri to turn on the lights, close the shades, or activate a scene that you’ve pre-set in the Home app. HomePod can even control these devices when you’re not home via the Home app, giving you the power to remotely control your devices from anywhere. So far, HomeKit compatible with connected devices from Ecobee, Honeywell, August, Kwikset, Philips Hue, Lutron, and more. What about audio specs? Apple wanted to create a speaker that delivered state-of-the-art sound that “rocks the house.” The HomePod includes an Apple-designed four-inch woofer for a deeper bass and seven beam-forming tweeters for high frequency acoustics. All of this was designed to “preserve the richness and intent of the original recordings.” Of course, we won’t be able to vouch for this until we get to listen to it later this year. Does it support multi-room audio? Thanks to the new AirPlay 2, Wi-Fi speakers are now part of the HomeKit family so you can get multi-room audio controls from a single iPhone. This gives you the option to use the Home app to control multiple HomePods in different rooms and sync audio playback. Furthermore, AirPlay 2 is also compatible with Wi-Fi speakers from other manufacturers, including Bose, Bang & Olufsen, Libratone, Devialet, Bowers & Wilkins, and Apple’s own Beats. Does it work with Spotify? Unfortunately, the only music streaming service that the HomePod supports is... Apple Music (act surprised). In fact, Apple claims the smart speaker was designed to be deeply tied to Apple Music, which costs $10 a month. And we don’t foresee Apple bringing another other services to the fold anytime soon (or ever). Apple What if I am an Apple Music member? If you’re an Apple Music member, the HomePod can access Apple Music’s full catalog, as well as tap into machine learning to learn about your music preferences and suggest songs and artists you might like. Apple refers to the HomePod as the perfect musicologist. In addition, you can create a shared Up Next queue with other nearby iOS devices so that everyone in the house can participate in picking music. Does it have any other new technology? Not every room is the same, so the HomePod has learned about spatial awareness. Its built-in sensors can determine the size and layout of its surroundings to automatically deliver the volume and acoustic output that best fills the room. Think of it as virtual surround sound. When two paired HomePods are in the room, they’ll be able to sense each other to deliver actual surround sound. Will it be listening in to all my conversations? Privacy is also being touted as a vital component of the HomePod. According to Apple, the smart speaker will only start collecting information after the “Hey Siri” voice command is activated. This means that you shouldn’t be afraid that the HomePod is secretly recording your conversations in order to sell you stuff. All information is recorded locally on the device and sent to Apple servers encrypted using an anonymous Siri ID. What iOS devices is it compatible with? HomePod is compatible with iPhone 5s and later, running the latest iOS 11. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Phil Schiller, Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, introduces the HomePod speaker at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Monday in San Jose, Calif. Photo: AP tech Siri, speakers and software: Highlights from the Apple show June 6 06:42 am JST 2 Comments SAN JOSE, Calif Siri is getting a new voice, and the Mac is getting a new name. Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company's Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. Here are the highlights: SIRI-POWERED SPEAKER An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple's Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. A NEW, SMARTER SIRI With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and center. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker's always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple's servers until you say, "Hey, Siri." The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon's Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won't know who you are — it'll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. A DIFFERENT REALITY Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come "as the technology hits an inflection point." Apple's new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change that. NEW HARDWARE Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. UPDATES FOR THE IPHONE AND IPAD With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new "do not disturb" mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

While many users who are already invested in the Google service ecosystem are likely to stay put out of convenience, more add-on type services such as Microsoft Planner and Teams continue to make the business level subscriptions of Office 365 very attractive for some organizations. This series of online guides over on the Office 365 Support site gives you a great resource not only for comparison but also transition as I mentioned above. The following eight guides are available: -- OneDrive for Business from Google Drive -- Word from Docs -- Excel from Sheets -- PowerPoint from Slides -- Outlook Mail from Gmail -- Outlook Calendar from G Suite Calendar -- Outlook People from G Suite Contacts -- OneDrive for Business from Box Each guide has focused areas including Overview, Work Together, Tips, Help and Training, and app specific information so you can find the specific area you need to learn more about as you prepare for or after making the transition between tools. ---------- But, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+. ---------------------------------- Looking for an awesome, no-nonsense technical conference for IT Pros, Devs, and Devops?

(Presumably, Samsung is only just around the corner with something similar, too.) At its annual developer conference in San Jose, California, on Monday, Apple promised its personal assistant software Siri a second home (or third or fourth if you count her macOS or watchOS presence). Having housed her up in iPhones for the past six years, her Cupertino, California-based sugar daddy rewarded her with residence inside a mic'd speaker called HomePod. Like Amazon Alexa in her Echo, Google Assistant in her Home, and Microsoft Cortana's planned appearance in Harman Kardon's forthcoming Invoke speaker, Apple Siri in her HomePod represents an effort to take a voice-based computing interface beyond the desktop and mobile devices. The HomePod has a face for radio. It resembles a large ball of twine, at least the white version. It also comes in hairball gray. Apple's approach, as befits its investment in music, focuses on the output, the speaker. HomePod is cast as a complement to Apple Music, a sensible marketing strategy considering that these bi-directional audio devices haven't yet really found a reason for being beyond demanding that stuff be brought to one's door. Of course, Siri via HomePod will be able to send text messages, recount news and weather updates, and manipulate HomeKit-enabled devices like thermostats and garage door openers. But not everyone wants to buy networked lights just to tell Siri to toggle them. Music, if not the killer app for IoT hubs, is at least something more than a handful of people care about. "Just like iPod reinvented music in our pockets, HomePod is going to reinvent music in our homes," said Phil Schiller, senior veep of worldwide marketing. Déjà vu Apple has been here before, with the iPod Hi-Fi, a semi-portable speaker system panned for its weight, lackluster features, and high price ($350) when launched in 2006. That happens to be the planned price of the HomePod, slated to debut in December. While it's significantly more expensive than Google Home ($130) or Amazon Echo ($180), the HomePod compares favorably to competing speakers like the Sonos 5 ($500) and perhaps to the Cortana-infused Harman Kardon speaker, which has yet to disclose a price. Apple made much of the HomePod's capacity to improve the experience of listening to music, and its forthcoming operating system updates will help in that regard. Its software's pending support for multi-room audio could make managing multiple speakers in conjunction with multiple audio sources less vexing. Staking out a position on Apple's oft-visited privacy high ground, Schiller offered reassurance that the HomePod doesn't record anything until the user addresses Siri. Amazon Echo and Google Home work the same way, maintaining active mics (unless disabled by the user) that supposedly don't transmit data until the invocation phrase has been detected. But Apple's disinterest (or arguably incompetence) in advertising makes it a more plausible privacy partner than its peers. Security researchers consider the presence of these devices a potential privacy risk, though perhaps it's less likely than being fooled by a phishing message or revealing too much via social media. Alongside risks, there may be benefits. In a recent murder investigation, Arkansas authorities sought audio data captured by an Amazon Echo. Amazon resisted the demand, a necessary step to reassure potential customers. Then the defendant in the case subsequently allowed authorities access to the voice recordings Amazon had captured, turning the privacy risk into a bid for exoneration. Beyond evidence, HomePod and its ilk may eventually become indispensable channels to summon service from a cloud of connected devices. Until then, they'll at least be able to play tunes on demand. And that counts for something. The HomePod will be available in Australia, the UK, and the US when it ships in December. ® Tips and corrections 50 Comments MORE Apple Iot Siri Ai Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Apple finally teaches Android music app to validate certificates Cupertino's so keen on Android it took eight months to repair interception bug 3 Comments Apple fights off iTunes patent spat appeal That bit where you said we didn't have to give them $500m – stick with that 7 Comments Apple blocks comms-snooping malware Leaked developer certificate revoked, protection updated 12 Comments Nokia, Apple lawyers make peace over nasty IP wrangle Unspecified lump sum heading for Finland 24 Comments Apple asks FCC to let it run mm-wave tests - for backhaul?!

Annual and the Midwinter Meeting alike both frequently revisit ALA’s home ground, where the central location helps ensure a high turnout. In other ways, however, this year’s get-together is all about change. Winds of Change Authors & Celebrities Restaurants Externally, the political climate in which ALA and libraries operate is highly volatile: while President Trump’s attempt to zero out funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) came to naught in the 2017 federal budget cycle (see p. 14), in part owing to impassioned advocacy, the effort signaled that nothing can be assumed to be off limits and that the pressure is on to defend funding for 2018. State and local funding are also under pressure, not only from direct cuts to libraries but from cuts elsewhere in budgets that push more responsibilities back on cities and towns. Learning how to fight back effectively without being constantly on the defensive—and buying into a narrative of threats to libraries’ very existence that omits the possibility of growth—is one of the key agenda items for many librarians at conference and afterward. Internally, ALA is also in a time of transition. As longtime executive director Keith Michael Fiels and ALA Washington Office head Emily Sheketoff depart, the organization is tasked with finding new leaders who can guide the association through challenging times and on to new triumphs. The direction some of those efforts will take is already clear: at Midwinter in Atlanta, ALA Council added equity, diversity, and inclusion as a fourth strategic direction for the organization, and those thematics are deeply embedded in the program offerings for annual, including several ticketed events that were already sold out at press time. Also on the agenda is getting more nimble in response to late-breaking news. In that regard, ALA certainly expects librarians to practice what they preach: the association scheduled a surprise closing session speaker whose identity was revealed at the last minute—Hillary Clinton! Below, LJ’s ­editors attending annual share some of the sessions they’re hoping to catch.—Meredith Schwartz Mahnaz Dar Assistant Managing Editor Healthy Aging @ Your Library: Connecting Older Adults to Health Information Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W175b) Are your oldest patrons being served?

Solidarity in Action: Combating Xenophobia and Islamophobia Sun., Jun. 25, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W183b) With anti-Muslim hate crimes on the rise in the wake of Donald Trump’s campaign speeches and his executive order attempting to ban those from Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States, ensuring that all members of the library community feel welcome is especially crucial now. Deepa Iyer, senior fellow of the Center for Social Inclusion and author of We Too Sing America: South Asian, Muslim, Arab, and Sikh Communities Shape Our Multiracial Future (New Pr.) will discuss ways to combat xenophobia and ­Islamophobia. Helping Library Users Navigate Fake News Sun., Jun. 25, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP W187c) Distinguishing “fake news!” from solid facts is harder than ever, but librarians are in a strong position to do something about it. Information literacy expert Joanna M. Burkhardt lays out just how to teach patrons to vet sources and reject misinformation—in short, how to foster a knowledgeable and skeptical populace. International Comics—Culture & Creation Beyond America Sun. Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (Hyatt Regency McCormick, Jackson Park/MCP 10ab) Graphic novels have long been one of my top formats, and some of my all-time favorites hail from beyond our shores (from Tsugumi Ohba’s manga “Death Note” to Penelope Bagieu’s recent California Dreamin’), so I’m eagerly awaiting this session about comics creation and fandom across the globe. Matt Enis Senior Editor, Technology Collaborating To Promote Cultural Identity in Public Libraries Through the Portal to Texas History Sat., Jun. 24, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP W181b) Jacob Mangum and Ana Krahmer from the Univ. of North Texas Libraries (UNT) will discuss “The Portal to Texas History,” a digital library created by UNT to digitize and build access to photographs, court records, maps, news videos, newspapers, and other historically relevant materials from the region.

Sat., Jun. 24, 3–4 p.m. (MCP S101) The title says it all, and this looks like a great panel, with John Chapman from OCLC, Stephen Meyer from the Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries (UWM), David Pimentel from Denver PL, and Philip Schreur from Stanford. Debra Shapiro from UWM will moderate. The group will discuss a range of topics, including how linked data can impact the discovery of library materials on the open web and how the transition from MARC to linked data might impact cataloging. Implicit Bias in Tech: What Libraries Can Do To Shift This Dynamic Sat., Jun. 24, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W181b) Presenters from Google will discuss the company’s recent research into this issue, as well as Google’s efforts to address biases that may discourage people from choosing to pursue computer science or coding education as a career. With attendees, they will explore ways in which libraries can help address these problems.

Measures That Matter: Building Bridges Between Data Collection Activities in Public Libraries Sat., Jun. 24, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP S106a) With data ever more important in society at large, it is critical that libraries more effectively use data as a collective tool to illustrate impact and help evaluate productive investment.

The Library Card Challenge: Local Leaders Collaborating for Increased Access to Educational Resources Sat., Jun. 24, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (Hyatt Regency Chicago, Columbus EF) Collaboration between schools and public libraries continues to evolve.

Growing Readership Through Diversity Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W190a) The push for diverse materials in our libraries includes collections for adults. Here publishers and librarians discuss. Bill McKibben: Imagining a World That Works—in Time To Preventa World That Doesn’t Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP S102) Don’t miss environmentalist, activist, and author Bill McKibben—a critical voice in a critical time. Diversity, Inclusion, and Social Justice in Technical Services Reaching in To Reach Out: Examining the State of Inclusivity Across Libraries, Archives, and Museums Both: Sat., Jun. 24, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W184bc/W185bc) Ideally, these important stances don’t end when the public or students aren’t in the room but extend to back room work, organizational design, and partnerships. These two programs, roomed next door to each other, promise conversation about how to imbed these ethics ever deeper in our libraries and partner organizations. Community Driven: Transforming the Subject Librarian Model in Public Libraries Sun., Jun. 25, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W175a) An intriguing approach to specialization and community engagement from Omaha PL, with librarians focused outward on “subject areas” such as Homelessness & Poverty, Health & Wellness, Seniors, Business, and Genealogy & Local History.

Sorry to miss it! Kiera Parrott Reviews Director Opening General Session featuring Reshma Saujani Fri., Jun. 23, 4–5:15 p.m. (MCP W375b/Skyline) Reshma Saujani is the founder of Girls Who Code, a nonprofit organization that empowers young women to enter the tech workforce and helps them learn computer programming skills. Her inspiring TED Talk, “Teach Girls Bravery, Not Perfection,” has well over three million views. She’ll also be a special keynote speaker at School Library Journal’s SLJTeen Live digital eventthis August. You Can’t Stay Neutral on a Moving Train: Making Critical Librarianship Tangible Through Library Programs and Exhibits Sat., Jun. 24, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W187c) How does social justice fit into library work? How can librarians support marginalized groups through library services? Rather than a broad philosophical discussion, this looks to be a practical session offering concrete ways library staff can make their programs and services more diverse and inclusive. Desegregating Public Libraries: The Tougaloo Nine Sun., Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W184d) In 1961, nine students from Tougaloo College entered a whites-only library in Jackson, MS, and were arrested. Fifty years after the event, one of the students, Geraldine Edwards Hollis, tells her story. Lisa Peet Associate Editor, News Washington Office Update Session—Be a Catalyst: Your Portfolio of Resources To Create Catalytic Change in Communities Sat., Jun. 24, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W176a) The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) recently launched an initiative aimed at assisting libraries and museums to develop their roles as community change agents, and IMLS director Kathryn K.

Daytime Astronomy at Your Library Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (Hyatt Regency McCormick, Grant Park/MCP 12ab) The first solar eclipse in 40 years, coming on August 21, promises to be a great opportunity to get patrons excited. The panel will highlight participatory, multimedia activities for adults and children that can be easily implemented in the library, including tips for safe solar viewing and astronomy tools to engage customers all year long. From MLS to MLD: It’s Time To Integrate Design Thinking and Philosophy into LIS Education Sun., Jun. 25, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W192) As design thinking becomes more ingrained into library practices, it stands to reason that it should be incorporated into library education as well. The knowledgeable panel includes public and academic librarians as well as LIS instructors with hands-on design thinking experience, and the session will look at how design precepts can help prepare tomorrow’s librarians to develop a problem-finding, solution-oriented mind-set. The Knight Foundation: Innovation in Libraries, Beyond the Talk Sun., Jun. 25, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP W184bc) Full disclosure: I was one of the library professionals interviewed by the Knight Foundation during the development of the featured report and attended the public library directors’ think tank where many of its ideas were surfaced. A report like this is never static, however, and I’m interested to hear how this in-depth look at ways that libraries can jump-start their innovation process has been expanded and developed by three library leaders who are taking these concepts and running with them. Crisis Communication: Who Speaks for Your Library? Sun., Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W194b) As LJ’s news editor, I’ve learned that libraries have their share of disasters, triumphs, conflicts, gossip, and opinions. Having the chance to tell their own stories to the media gives libraries an advantage when it comes to community perceptions, and these concerns don’t begin and end with their communications directors or PR person. This discussion group, with a panel of speakers from United for Libraries, RUSA, and Chapter Relations, will examine aspects of crisis communication so libraries can begin to formulate a communications plan. Meredith Schwartz Executive Editor Protest & Preservation Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W176a) Activism has always produced a lot of artifacts—from posters to manifestos—and they’ve often been a challenge to document. The shift to fast, decentralized organizing via social media, from the Arab Spring to the Women’s March, only increases those challenges. LJ’s coverage of the Documenting the Now project first sensitized me to these issues; I look forward to hearing the panelists’ perspective, particularly because it includes voices from outside of libraries, including a political philosopher and a documentary filmmaker. Awesomeville All Access: Sharing Our Cities and Towns Sat., Jun. 24, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W187c) We are increasingly seeing libraries and librarians taking an active role in civic change beyond the library—not just leading by example but by getting their hands dirty to achieve larger community goals. I’m intrigued to learn how libraries are assisting access to local cultural venues, public spaces, nature, and more by “acting as agents and brokers.” Applying Racial Equity Analysis to Library Policies, Programs and Processes Sun., Jun. 25 3–4 p.m. (MCP W180) I often hear from librarians who are aware that institutionalized racism impacts their libraries but aren’t sure what to do about it, so I’m excited to hear about lessons learned and concrete tools, including resources available through the Local and Regional Government Alliance on Race and Equity and the Center for Social Inclusion (CSI), from 2016 LJ Mover & Shaker Amita Lonial as well as Simran Noor, CSI’s VP, policy and programs. Library Takeover; or, How Madison Public Library Relinquished Control of Community Programming to…Wait for It…Actual Community Members Sun., Jun. 25, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W187b) I’m excited to learn about an innovative, six-week event planning boot camp that offered up significant library resources, spaces, and money to participant teams made up of individual, nonaffiliated community members to build large-scale community events around the city, with racial equity as a key objective. Asking for a Friend: Tough Questions (and Honest Answers) About Organizational Culture Mon., Jun. 26, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W192) Organizational culture is often the make it or break it factor in whether new initiatives succeed and employees are satisfied. Yet they’re hard to initiate intentionally and often even harder to change. In this session, “several public library leaders have vowed to tell the unvarnished truth when asked about organizational culture”: Susan Brown, Chapel Hill PL; Richard Kong, Skokie PL, and Megan Egbert, Meridian District Library. Audience members can submit questions both beforehand and during the session and can “Ask for a Friend” to maintain a safe environment. Stephanie Sendaula Associate Editor, LJ Reviews The (In)Flexible Box: Transforming Older Library Spaces Sat., Jun. 24, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W179a) I’ve been interested in library design since the placemaking session at this past Midwinter. Since space and cost are limitations for libraries of all types, I’m eager to hear advice from librarians and architects on how to reconfigure existing spaces to fit modern need. Aging—a New Frontier: Implications and Opportunities for Libraries and Librarians Sun., Jun. 25, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W175b) How can we better serve older adults? Learn more from the Retired Members Round Table, the Western Reserve Area Agency on Aging, and public librarians in this informative, practical session. Whole Person Librarianship: Libraries and Social Workers in Collaboration Sun., Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W178a) Based on a standing-room-only conversation starter in 2015, this program features successful collaborations between libraries and social service providers. Libraries Unlimited is also planning a forthcoming book on the subject. Libraries and the Military/Veteran Population: Transformative Service Through Cultural Competencies Sun., Jun. 25, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W179b) I’m also eager to learn how we can engage with veterans, service members, and their families. This team of panelists includes veterans, librarians from military families, and others performing outreach. The Glass Is Half Full: Getting More out of Less Mon., Jun. 26, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP W175b) We’re used to doing more with less, but we could always use new ideas on how to save both time and money. Join librarians from public libraries and government agencies to share ideas on how to lead with staffing shortages, prevent burnout, and adapt to change. Exhibits McCormick Place–Chicago, 2301 S. King Dr., Chicago, IL With 900-plus exhibitors, the hall will offer a few new attractions in ALA’s backyard.

Laptops by Lori Grunin 6 June 2017 5:50 am AEST @LoriGrunin Apple unveils iMac Pro at WWDC Apple reveals its new high-end iMac Pro workstation. The new machine will be $4,999 and available in December. 2:29 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF For WWDC 2017, Apple headed south to San Jose, dogged by damning comparisons with Google, Facebook and Microsoft over its lack of attention to mixed reality (VR and AR), Siri's absence from your smart home in comparison with smart home hubs like the Google Home  and Amazon Echo and other ways in which Apple seems to have fallen behind. Folks were eager to hear about Apple's plans to catch up in these leading-edge markets. 49 Apple's biggest WWDC announcements Even before the conference opening, we began to hear the numbers: iOS app developers earned $20 billion in 2016 (and given Apple's 30 percent cut, that means it made a not-so-paltry $6 billion) and downloads are growing at a nice pace. The company updated its Swift Playgrounds, a teach-kids-to-code-Swift (its proprietary programming language) app, to support control over robots and drones. The keynote began with a video showing how the world would fall apart if we didn't have our iOS apps and the safe and sane App Store. And in a random announcement, we see a small step for Amazon, a huge leap for Apple TV owners: you're getting an Amazon Video app.  And of course, all the inteligence is driven by enhanced Apple AI technology. Later in the conference, Michelle Obama will be talking empowerment. Apple's HomePod is a smart speaker for your home Apple wants the new Siri-powered device to be the center of your home. It will cost $349 and will be available starting in December. by Scott Stein 1:00 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF HomePod Interestingly, Apple positioned its new home speaker as a music experience rather than just the rumored a smart-home hub, ostensibly to "reinvent home music." You can't get it until later in 2017, though. Dubbed the HomePod, it has better audio specs than other hub speakers -- pretty good audio specs in general for its size -- and an A8 chip for processing (the same chip that's in the iPhone). It uses a wide-array mic that supposedly can hear you over the music, and naturally integrates with Apple Music and can control HomeKit devices. It will ship in December for $350.  16 Say hello to Apple's HomePod smart speaker iOS 11 and apps The latest update of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11, has some notable new features: Interface: A redesigned app drawer with horizontal scrolling as well as a redesigned control center with more 3D Touch operations. The lockscreen can show all notifications,  iMessages: Automatic message synchronization across devices via iCloud. Apple Pay: Now it supports person-to-person payments across all iOS devices and works with iMessages. Siri: She's got a more natural-sounding voice and can translate for you and suggest tasks. Plus there's a new more visual interface. And she knows you across your devices. But she'll respect your privacy. Camera: New H.265 video encoding for more efficient storage and a new High Efficiency Image Format based on H.265 to replace JPEG. Threre's a new depth API (needed for AR). It will enable the faux defocus mode for portraits, too. Photos: Welcome editable Live Photos with GIF-like tools like looping and reversing, and a long-exposure effect. Memories now recognizes pets and supports vertical video. Apple Maps: Now with floor plans of the mall! Also lane guidance and a do-not-disturb mode that senses when a car is moving. AirPlay 2: Control multiroom speakers (with supported speakers), and Apple TV. Apple Music will show you your friends's suggested picks. Redesigned App Store with a games tab. And more, of course. Though not a feature, Apple also launched an augmented-reality programming interface, ARKit, so that developers can incorporate AR into apps. It demoed a better-looking Pokemon Go built using it. 29 Here are the iOS 11 features Apple announced at WWDC 2017  MacBooks and iMacs The iMacs get better displays, better storage options, an improved display and 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C connectors. Also, an update to Intel 7th-generation and the new integrated graphics, plus the Retina 4K incorporates the discrete RX500 series and the 5K model gives you Radeon RX500 series options. That puts them on par with Windows 10 all-in-ones. The 21.5-inch starts at $1,100 and the 5K 27-inch starts at $1,800. A 4K 21.5 inch starts at $1,300. A new iMac Pro will ship by the end of the year, the company's most powerful Mac ever. It has better cooling than a typical iMac, it ships with up to an 18-core Xeon, Radeon Vega graphics, up to 128GB of ECC memory and up to 4TB of SSD storage.  And it will start at $5,000 when it ships in December. The MacBooks are refreshed with 7th-generation Intel chips and better graphics, and the 13-inch without Touchbar gets a price drop to $1,300. The Air gets a brush-up. 13 The new iMac Pro is truly a beast iPad and iPad Pro Apple adds an iPad Pro model with a 10.5-inch display in the 9.7-inch body, thanks to smaller bezels. Both iPad Pros will get new displays, with True Tone, DCI-P3 gamut, 600-nit brightness and ultralow reflectivity. A new feature, Pro Motion, bumps the refresh rate to 120Hz. Latency drops to 20ms with the Apple Pencil. They're also faster, thanks to the 12-core GPU and six-core CPU Fusion A10X chip. A better camera with 4K and wide-gamut capture is another hardware highlight, along with USB-C fast charging. They both come with 64GB memory and start at $650 for the smaller and $800 for the larger model. They'll be available next week. There are more iPad-specific features in iOS 11. Swipe up to bring up the dock to switch apps or bring one up and drag-and-drop anything. A new Files app brings a more desktoplike file system operation that supports third-party storage providers. There's a special markup mode for use with the Pencil and it does handwriting recognition in Notes. MacOS High Sierra The MacOS desktop operating system didn't get a major update, as you can tell from the name, just some refinements. But a lot of the High Sierra refinements are performance-focused, which is always welcome. The big enhancements: Safari: It "helps give you a serene browsing experience." Whut? But now it's faster, with autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention to filter cross-site scripting and so on. Mail: Split view for the compose window, smaller storage footprint. Photos: New organization and editing tools, filter by keywords and file types, better face recognition, synchronization across devices. The editing tools can now synchronize with other editing tools. And there are new photo book partnerships. The file system: This has needed an update for a long time, and now the much more modern APFS is the default. Video: Support for hardware acceleration and a software encoder for H.265 video. Graphics: An update to its acceleration architecture, Metal 2, with a lot of performance increases. It also supports a new external enclosure for MacBooks, with Thunderbolt 3 and A Radeon RX 580. Metal 2 also adds hooks for VR. Want MacOS High Sierra and iOS 11 sooner rather than later? Sign up for the public betas. 10 MacOS High Sierra has some really cool new features WatchOS 4 New to WatchOS, Apple's watch operating system: New faces: A new Siri watch face and a new complication for showing notifications, a Kaleidoscope face based on your image and faces with "Toy Story" characters. Fitness: Monthly challenges in the Activity tracker; a new interface and new high-intensity workout in the Workout app, two-way data exchange with gym equipment, and more. Music: It integrates better with Apple Music to feed your favorites to the watch. A vertically scrolling interface. Native Bluetooth to connect to sensors. 25 Apple WatchOS 4 preview in pics It was one of the most fast-moving, packed 2.5-hour WWDC keynotes I've seen in a while. I'm exhausted. See you in a year.

WWDC is traditionally the place where Apple shows off improvements to the software that powers its devices, rather than hardware revisions or brand new machines. But with the company feeling pressure from rivals in the home computer and laptop spaces — and with many of its Mac lines having languished without significant updates for quite a while — many analysts were tipping an uncharacteristically hardware-heavy show, and that's exactly what we got.

More videos Apple drops its latest gear The computer giant unveils an enormous assortment of new products. Hello HomePod As expected, Apple is introducing a smart speaker to compete with Google's Home and Amazon's Echo. The HomePod, Apple says, is a wireless speaker that uses "spatial awareness" to adjust its output to the shape of its surroundings. Designed to pair with an iPhone and play music via a user's Apple Music subscription, the device will also field queries and control other smart home devices thanks to Siri integration. The speaker features an upward-facing woofer, seven tweeters each with dedicated amps and a six-microphone array. The HomePod will launch in Australia in December, although a price is yet to be announced. In the US it will cost $US349 ($466), more than twice the price of its Google competitor. Advertisement iMacs and MacBooks updated, Mac Pro re-imagined While whispers of a touch-enabled Mac line that would open the door to more versatile Apple machines turned out to be baseless, Apple is significantly updating several of its existing products with modern components, as well as introducing a new turbo-charged iMac. The iMac Pro blends the super-thin design of the standard Apple all-in-one with the bleeding-edge productivity focus of the old Mac Pro, packing enough power to handle high-end tasks like 3D modelling for VR. The increased power means Apple needed to craft a new kind of cooling mechanism to keep the components' temperatures lowered in the skinny enclosure. The dark grey computer sports a 27-inch, 5K display and will start at $US4999 ($6676) in the US. So far there is no word on international pricing, and no indication of what the most powerful iteration of the device — with 18-core Xeon processors, a Radeon Pro Vega GPU with 16GB of VRAM and a 4TB SSD hard drive — will cost. For regular folks who don't need a computer that can handle artificial intelligence research, the iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro have all been brought up to date with new Intel Kaby Lake processors. The iMac now features Thunderbolt 3 ports and, in most models, dedicated graphics chips. At the low end there is still a 21.5-inch iMac with a 2.3GHz processor and a 1080p display, starting at $1599. More powerful 21.5-inch models with 4K screens start at $1899, and 27-inch models with 5K screens start at $2699. Meanwhile the 12-inch Macbook has faster hard drives and now supports up to 16GB of memory, while the 13-inch Pro has a new entry-level model that comes in at $1899. The 15-inch Pro, which starts at $3499, now comes with a more powerful AMD graphics chip with either 2GB or 4GB of memory. The new iMacs, MacBooks and MacBook Pros are all available for order now. iPad Pro gets a refresh Despite ever-shrinking sales, Apple announced a refresh for its line of high-end tablets. The iPad Pro now comes in an all-new 10.5-inch variation in addition to the original 12.9-inch size. The previously available 9.7-inch Pro appears to have been put out to pasture, presumably to avoid confusion with the standard non-Pro iPad, which is the same size. The 10.5-inch Pro has some impressively skinny bezels and weighs in at a tiny 469 grams. Both models feature an improved processor and something Apple calls "ProMotion", which essentially means the screens are now capable of higher refresh rates for smoother video and animations. The new iPad Pro starts at $979 and $1199 for the smaller and larger models respectively. The standard iPad and iPad Mini 4 remain unchanged. First look at iOS 11, MacOS High Sierra and WatchOS updates While the iPhone was largely absent from the announcements at WWDC, Apple did give a sneak peek into the future of the device with the unveiling of a new version of iOS, which also powers its iPads. New in iOS 11 will be a better camera app, a more capable Apple Pay system, a new version of Apple Maps with indoor mapping and a new toolkit to help developers bring augmented reality features to their apps. On iPad Pro, a redesigned app switcher and customisable dock gives the operating system a flatter, more modern look. The new software also contains a "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode, which Apple says will help prevent iPhones distracting those behind the wheel, and a new "Files" app that resembles a traditional computer file system for viewing and organising documents. On the Mac front, Apple showed off High Sierra, the next version of MacOS. The update includes refinements to Photos and enhanced ad-blocking features for Safari. Most improvements will be under the hood, including an all-new file system, VR features and support for the new HEVC video standard. Finally, the company previewed some improvements coming to the Apple Watch. A new Siri watchface predicts what you'll want to see when you look at your wrist, while improvements to the device's fitness features will let you track new types of high-intensity workouts. 3 comments Log in to comment New User?

By Jared Newman TechHive | Jun 5, 2017 3:19 PM PT Credit: TechHive More like this Apple HomePod FAQ: Here’s everything we know about the new Siri smart speaker The state of the Apple HomeKit market: Apple's smart-home ecosystem has yet to... Apple AirPlay 2 adds whole-home audio for speakers Video ShapeScale 3D body scanner hands-on Apple has announced its long-rumored answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Dubbed the HomePod, it's a $349 Siri-powered speaker that will try to outshine its competitors in terms of audio quality. "Just like the iPod reinvented music in our pockets, HomePod is going to reinvent music in our homes," said Apple's head of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. Mentioned in this article Amazon Echo Dot (2nd generation)  TechHive rating $49.99MSRP $49.99View on Amazon On stage, Schiller talked up the HomePod's acoustic qualities, which include seven beam-forming horn-loaded tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and a four-inch powered woofer that can adapt to the acoustic characteristics of the room it's playing in. All that's driven by an Apple A8 processor, similar to what's inside the iPhone 6 and fourth-generation Apple TV. Users can also set up two HomePods next to one another, and they'll synchronize for better sound, the speaker will support whole-home audio with other speakers that support Apple's AirPlay 2 wireless audio technology. [ Further reading: The best white LED smart bulbs ] TechHive The HomePod flexes its audio quality muscles. To activate the speaker, users can say "Hey Siri" and then ask to play songs from Apple Music. Schiller talked up the HomePod's "musicologist" features, which can answer requests like "Play something new," "What was the top song in 1983?" and "Who's the drummer in this?" The top of the HomePod is also touch-sensitive for controlling volume and pausing. TechHive Siri can answer all kinds of musical queries on HomePod. Schiller had much less to say about HomePod's broader Siri smarts, although the product page on Apple's website hints that it can perform many of the smart-home tasks that an Amazon Echo or Google Home can do.  In addition to playing music, HomePod can provide news, general knowledge, reminders, podcasts, translation, weather, and HomeKit controls, among other things. But Apple did not announce support for third-party voice skills, like Amazon and Google offer with their smart speakers. Although Siri does support a narrow set of third-party voice actions on iOS devices, it's unclear whether these will be accessible on HomePod. Mentioned in this article Sonos Play:5 (2015 Edition)  TechHive rating $499.00MSRP $499.00View on Amazon Also worth noting: Apple didn't announce support for any music services beyond its own Apple Music. Users might be able to send music from an iOS or Mac device over AirPlay, but it doesn't sound like there's a way to request music by voice from third-party services like Spotify, Pandora, Amazon Music, or TuneIn. (Conversely, HomePod will be the only connected speaker with Apple Music support.) TechHive Siri supports some general queries on HomePod, but there's no word on third-party product integration. In lieu of those skills, Apple is banking on HomePod's superior audio quality to stand out from the competition. HomePod's room-equalization feature sounds very similar to Sonos' TruePlay, but Sonos is relying on Amazon's Alexa for voice control. What's more, that project is still in the works. By the same token, you can drive beefier speakers with a $50 Echo Dot, but Apple's solution is less cluttered and it offers whole-home audio support. HomePod might also have some unique appeal to folks who've invested in Apple's burgeoning HomeKit smart home ecosystem. Still, those users will have to wait a while to get one. Apple plans to launch HomePod in December for $349, starting with the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Apple is not yet taking pre-orders.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home is now available for pre-order in Canada By Ida Torres - June 5, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you live in Canada and you’ve been reading all these news items about the new voice-activated smart speaker from Google, you’ve probably been wondering when you will be able to have something like that for your home. Wonder no more as the tech giant has officially announced that Google Home is finally available for pre-order through the Google Store and through BestBuy.com. This also means that Google Assistant is coming to Canadian homes in both English and French. With the magic words, “Ok Google”, you will now be able to do a lot of things without having to lift your smartphone or any other gadget around you. You can ask your Google Assistant questions and it can tap into a whole world of Google through Search, Maps, Translate, etc. You can also ask it to help you manage your tasks, set schedules, add items in your to-do lists, set alarms and reminders, etc. If it’s music that you’re looking for, Google Home can give that to you because after all, it is a speaker. But with just simple voice commands, you can get services like Spotify or Google Play Music to play your favorite songs, news, podcasts, or even radio. And it will bring it to you in Hi-Fi sound quality. And when giving your commands, the speaker can still hear you even if you’re a bit away through far-field microphones and natural language processing. You can also use Google Assistant to control lights and switches in smart devices like Nest, Philips, or Samsung SmartThings. Google Home can be pre-ordered through the Google Store or through BestBuy.com. It will cost you around $179.99.

The Mail yesterday found a series of tirades by Ahmad Musa Jibril and Abu Haleema that were easily accessible on the video sharing site. They used the Google-owned video platform to spread the warped messages which helped turn 27-year-old Khuram Butt into a fanatic bent on mass slaughter. In the videos found by the Mail, they told followers to make ‘enemies’ out of all kuffar [non-believers], and instructed Islamists not to grieve for terror victims. Jibril: The ranting preacher of hate condemns Muslims who feel sorry for terror victims Haleema: In one diatribe (pictured) he declares that he will never stop calling for Sharia law They also branded moderate Muslims as ‘malignant tumours’ in the Islamic community, and denounced the London Mayor Sadiq Khan – a Muslim – as kuffar. According to a friend of Butt, he was obsessed with Jibril, and became radicalised after watching YouTube videos of the preacher. He was also an associate of Haleema, appearing alongside him in last year’s Channel 4 documentary, the Jihadis Next Door. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Manchester bomber's brother, 23, who was arrested in... Goldsmiths in Twitter spat over London terror attack: Jemima... Share this article Share The hate preacher’s videos have been watched more than a million times, and won warped comments of approval from viewers, one of whom wrote: ‘Kuffar must [and] will be eliminated’. But Google has refused to remove them, insisting they did not break its own rules. Last night, politicians and terror experts accused the US technology giant of ‘colluding’ with hate preachers. Yvette Cooper, the Labour candidate for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford and former shadow home secretary, said: ‘It is sickening that extremist, terrorist material which intends to radicalise people so that they carry out heinous attacks like the one we saw on London Bridge is still easily available on YouTube. According to a friend of Butt, he was obsessed with Jibril, and became radicalised after watching YouTube videos of the preacher Butt was also an associate of Haleema, appearing alongside him in last year’s Channel 4 documentary, the Jihadis Next Door ‘Google are aiding and abetting terrorists by leaving this vile stuff online. This platform is being used to feed warped ideologies that support deathly attacks.’ Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said there was ‘no question at all’ that the material should be removed. ‘[The technology companies] bear clear moral responsibility for the harm that is done. They collude in the Islamist incitement. ‘GCHQ could disrupt these channels of communication. Let the US companies sue the UK Government; there’s no English jury that would find for the Americans.’ Last night, a YouTube spokesman said that it wanted to work with the Government. ‘We take our role in combatting the spread of extremist material very seriously,’ the spokesman said. ‘YouTube has clear policies prohibiting terrorist recruitment and content intending to incite violence, and we act quickly to remove videos violating these. We also terminate accounts run by terrorist organisations or those that repeatedly violate our policies.’ Two of the three terrorists - Khuram Butt (left) and Rachid Redouane (right) - who massacred seven people in a rampage which started on London Bridge on Saturday night One of Gabriele Sciotto's photographs showed the face of the dying terrorist, wearing an Arsenal football shirt and combat trousers, just a few metres in front of him However, its words will fall flat in light of the grotesque videos by Jibril and Haleema still circulating on YouTube. Jibril, a Palestinian-American cleric, denounced religious tolerance and condemned Muslims who feel sympathy for victims of terror attacks. In one video, watched more than 41,000 times, Jibril tells his followers: ‘[There are] malignant tumours within this umma [Muslim community] crying for the causes of others. The least worst Muslim dying anywhere in the world is more worthy of mourning and attention than the best kaffir.’ Haleema said in a video posted on the day of the 2016 Brussels attack: ‘Don’t try and be like the kuffar [non-believer]. Do not grieve over them.’ He also taunted non-Muslims in a video posted in January 2016, and watched more than 5,000 times. ‘We’re not going to stop calling for the domination of Islam.’ Butt and his fellow murderers were shot dead inside Borough Market and wore fake suicide vests as they ran down people with a white van and then stabbed and slashed people on Saturday night Heleema and Jibril’s messages are also spreading on Facebook and Twitter. Yesterday, the Mail also found many links promoting them on the social networks. One Twitter account set up to spread Jibril’s message offers followers a free DVD. He also has a Facebook page with links to his sermons. Facebook and Twitter accounts under Haleema’s name were also last night active, though it is not clear whether they are genuine. Twitter declined to comment on ‘privacy’ grounds. Most of Haleema’s YouTube videos were posted before he appeared in the Channel 4 documentary in January 2016. In 2015, he was accused of radicalising a schoolboy who was convicted over a plot to behead police during an Anzac Day parade in Australia. He was arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism in 2015. He does not appear to have posted to YouTube since June 2016. His whereabouts are unknown.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) That right there? That's on'a them Homepods. (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Although a new product announcement from Apple isn’t the major pop-cultural event that it used to be, the pitiless taskmaster that is capitalism demands that the company continue pressing ever forward with sleek new gadgets exciting enough to convince consumers that last year’s gadget just isn’t good enough anymore. It did so today at the WWDC (World Wide Developer’s Conference), its annual in-house presentation of its newest innovations for software developers as reported by The New York Times. Chief among those innovations is the Homepod, Apple’s answer to Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Google Home. Aside from its rippity-rappin’ name, the Homepod does pretty much the same stuff all those other home assistants do, but with a more streamlined design. Voiced by a reportedly new and improved Siri, the particular gadget will retail for $349, which is significantly more than its rivals—the Echo currently retails for $179 and Google Home for $129—but its speakers are supposedly better than the rest, thus justifying the higher price tag. It will be available in December. Then there’s the new iPad Pro. Apple may be playing catchup in the home-assistant realm, but it innovated tablets back in 2010 with the original iPad; the only problem is, iPads apparently don’t break often enough, resulting in a decline in sales in recent years. So, to persuade existing iPad customers to buy another one, Apple has unveiled an iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch display, in between the 9.7 inch and 12.9-inch models. It’s also got something called ProMotion that’s supposed to ”increase the refresh rate and make motion smoother in video content,” although if it’s anything like the motion-smoothing technology on HDTVs that produces the dreaded “soap opera effect,” that may or may not be a good thing. Regardless, the 10.5 inch iPad Pro retails for $649 and starts shipping next week. Aside from the expected introduction of new versions of its mobile (iOS 11) and computer (High Sierra) operating systems—the latter of which does come with one exciting feature, blocking autoplay videos on Safari—the other big announcement at the unusually hardware-focused presentation was the unveiling of a new version of Apple’s desktop model iMac Pro. The souped-up new version ”will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega,” making it Apple’s most powerful computer to date, according to the NYT. Apple’s been lagging behind in terms of professional-quality hardware in recent years, with its last high-performance desktop model, the MacPro, landing with a thud back in 2013. Giving the new iMacPro another chance won’t come cheap, though: These super-powered new models go for $5,000 a pop and will be available in December. Submit your Newswire tips here.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

Bruce Wayne From Fire to Ice. Not so subtle. Daniel 'Cause when Amazon made their last phone, all they did was get burned. XD NexusKoolaid And what did they do with all those unsold Fire phones they had stockpiled? They put 'em on ice. Daniel And what a bummer for them; they really had a burning desire to sell a bunch of them NexusKoolaid But in the end, they just decided to chill out. Daniel Bet you don't get these kind of comments on other websites. lol 4Ui812 She's sun and rain , She's fire and ice , a little crazy but it's nice , and when she gets mad best to leave her alone Daniel "You leave my wife outta this" -Jeff Bezos talking about his phone Lord Argyris Maybe they just like Pokemon? I expect they'll chain as many types that are super effective on the next in line as possible. Expect Flying, Bug and Psychic phones in the coming years. Or Dragon, Dragon, Dragon... MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up. Still, that was a long break that it took. The naming scheme is not bad but still kind of funny. Paul Monroe, Jr. Now if they could just do that with the fire tablets they might actually have something going on..

Apple continues to emphasize privacy. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 5:52 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Kevork Djansezian | Getty Apple just revealed what it's been up to in software for the past year ... and it's remarkably Google-y. During the Monday keynote at the company's 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference, the company announced a bunch of catch-ups: Siri got the ability to translate languages, something Google has provided through Google Translate since 2006. For now, Siri can only translate spoken English into five other languages, while Google's service can work with more than 100 languages, but it's a start. A Do Not Disturb While Driving mode, which delivers a different user interface when iPhone users are driving. Google delivered an Android Auto feature for smartphones last year. Improvements to the AirPlay feature for sharing audio from iOS devices, which one-ups Google's invasion of home audio speakers through the Chromecast Audio dongle. Apple will let people play audio in multiple rooms while Google works on introducing that feature to all speakers that have Chromecast built in. Improvements to the Camera app that comes with iOS so it's able to make loops with the Live Photos video snippets that are automatically created out of each photo. Google introduced this feature in an app called Motion Stills last year. Siri will soon be front and center on the Apple Watch, just like the Google Assistant has started showing up on Android Wear smartwatches. A HomePod speaker that plays music and lets you talk to Siri. The Google Home does similar things but comes with the Google Assistant instead of Siri. More broadly, Apple has built tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality, and now the company is starting to let outside developers use those tools to enhance their own applications. The thing is, Google already did the same thing, with the Tango mobile augmented reality system and services running in its cloud. To be clear, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Snap have all been busy in both AI and AR. But Google has put AI at the core of its business, with CEO Sundar Pichai going so far as to call it an "AI-first" company. With Apple doing small things to make AI more visible and powerful across more of its devices, the company appears to be acknowledging people's continued use of impressively smart apps like Google Translate and the Google App. The message is clear: We're getting smarter now, so don't even worry about using the Google stuff. The uncertainties lie in how many Google developers and customers will defect.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said.

Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Apple's New HomePod Looks Fine As Hell Adam Clark Estes Jun 6, 2017, 6:45am ⋅ Filed to:  apple feature homepod wwdc wwdc 2017 Share It's game-time! Apple just announced its long-awaited take on a smart speaker, completing the smart speaker triumvirate along with Google and Amazon. The gadget itself isn't particularly remarkable, but it is an Apple gadget. That's a big deal for a lot of people. Photo: Apple The new Apple HomePod is a lot like its competitors: Amazon Echo and Google Home. You can activate it with a wake word — "Hey Siri" — and ask an artificially intelligent assistant, Siri, to play music. The HomePod comes with an array of six microphones so that it can pick up your voice from any direction. Apple promises the Siri team has made some updates so that the AI works better for music requests. Apple has also make HomePod a "home assistant" that can answer all kinds of questions and tell you about the weather or the traffic. HomePod also works like a smart home hub for all HomeKit-compatible devices. So now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights or lock the door without moving a muscle. You can also control your HomeKit devices remotely now, using the Home app on any iOS device. Yes, you can do the same thing with an Amazon Echo or a Google Home, but remember: This is an Apple gadget. GIF: Apple / Gizmodo Where Apple hopes to stand out in its late entry to the smart speaker market, however, is by putting extra emphasis on the speaker part of the equation. While the Echo and Home aren't known for great sound quality, Apple engineers — presumably with some help from Beats engineers — built the HomePod for high-fidelity audio quality. That includes a "seven beam-forming tweeter array", "precision acoustic horns" and "directional control". Apple says that you don't need to know what that means but the seven-inch-tall speaker sounds really great. There's also a "virtual surround sound" feature that helps the small speaker fill up a room with your sick jams. In other words, Sonos is now an Apple competitor. Photo: Alex Cranz That's all fun and games until you start to wonder if Siri is now spying on you and your loved ones. Apple says that "only after 'Hey Siri' is recognised locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier". It's unclear what happens to the data once its on Apple's servers. The new speaker will cost $US349, with Australian pricing to be confirmed — we expect around the $499 to $549 range. It will come in white and space grey and will start shipping in December in Australia, the UK and US. And even though it isn't as feature packed as the latest Echo, you're probably going to want it, if you're an Apple fan. Even if you're not, it's a fine-looking gadget.

Reply -1 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:59am Much higher audio quality, and fits into an ecosystem that millions of people are already using. I think they will be okay, and not a lot of luck will be required. I think people constantly miss that this is what Apple does. They start developing a product when a new product category is looming, they let others enter the market space and kludge around, and then after a year or two they enter the market with a (usually) more refined product. They did it with the iPod, it wasn't the first or the cheapest MP3 player by a long shot, but it did okay for them. This is still a nascent market, and this is really the first product to integrate personal assistant stuff with a good quality speaker system. A single SONOS speaker costs this much or more, if it sounds as good or better, then it will probably do more than okay. Reply 1 soldant @soldant Jun 6, 2017, 10:58am This. Apple aren't new or innovative, and they haven't been for decades now. Instead they take existing concepts and refine them into a product the general population likes to use. Very few tech companies do much that's innovative or novel these days - they're iterating on existing ideas most of the time (or bringing ideas back from the dead). I think Apple's HomePod has the potential to be as successful as Alexa or Google Home. Whether or not it will ultimately depends on if people actually want these devices. Reply 0 gtasoz @gtasoz Jun 6, 2017, 4:33pm That was my reaction too. Unless they make the thing SING with connectivity and be truly useful in the Internet-of-Things world :: Home Control, Spatial smarts and other clever things, I can see this status symbol tanking big time. May be wrong but they will have to get it VERY right or people will be severely pissed. Reply 0 zak @zak Jun 6, 2017, 2:26pm Apple engineers — presumably with some help from Beats engineers — built the HomePod for high-fidelity audio qualityDoes that mean it will include extra bits of metal just to make it heavier?

By Barbara Ortutay Associated Press, By Michael Liedtke Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called  machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera -- the same one found in the iPhone 7 -- along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. --The Associated Press Published on: Jun 5, 2017 Advertisement

This week, we're doing Google Photos. To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below. So, how many photos are synced to your account? I'm at a little over 8,000 at this time, and that honestly doesn't seem like a lot to me (my Lightroom catalog contains over twice as many). I'll be curious to see how many of your break into the five-figure ranges. How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

Boolean Corporation the trick is to plug your iPhotos Library to the desktop uploader and see the magic happen. I have my Canon and SONY photos up there as well. ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before... After half a year with this career and therefore i obtained cash in sum Thirty six Thousand us dollars... Ordinarily I make up approximate to eighty bucks/h and work for three to four hours every single day.And excellent point about this task is the fact that you can supervise time and effort whenever you work and for just how long as you may like and you attain a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too vidvox That was the craziest thing about using my DSLR on a trip through Texas last year, looking at the photos online and seeing the correct GPS location on them! Tyler Humphreys My mom had some pictures of Siberia, California and Google Photos thought they were from Russia, just from an album named "Siberia". chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google Rob 54,857..... Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit. I feel like this would be a different story if I had something like the Pixel or Nexus 6P, or even the Nexus 5X instead. LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Jerry Suppan Wow!　And I thought I had too many at 51,000+. Well, I guess we can store our entire life from birth if if we include pre-digital era scanned photos. (^J^) Đức Thành That is a creepy thought but somehow I find it kind of exciting as well. Imagine storing all of our memories, thoughts and emotions on the cloud. Victor A backup of met-art archives? 😁 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Luqmaan Mathee "To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below." It's in the article. Teja Oops, missed that. Its 51,929 photos. :D Carl Draper Photos does not appear for me on that page Margaritas Ante Porcos omg! are breaking films into frames and then upload? lol Kenni Odelheim I said 20-40 as a guess, but it was 46k I found out afterwards... jesus man..

Lexxior wtf 20000+ bookmarks?! Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999.

But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space.

Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums.

Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson.

Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file. Robert Porter Yes, any photo on Gphotos is analyzed. If they don't have the locations, I believe Google fills that info with your Google maps location during that time. HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote. McClain S https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4911bca160a898e3d9f1f092a2af15587d485f0ca9ef12ceb21637dcd00bd2a6.png Arvid Over a 100.000 photos. I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client. I'm up to 116,053, but that number grows by about 1000 every couple of weeks. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6190002ab404d0e7e513fe45d2931f9173bc76ab04c9c6bfc6167f5e961b10a.jpg Deb Newman I quit using google photo because my account got hacked and googles recovery system wouldn't verify it was me even though I knew most of the answers to their questions, finally got to speak to someone from tech support and still would not verify.

Mangesh Narawade If Google include true 'hide photos' feature with security like pincode/fingerprint, these numbers will go sky high gsDroid You should have had an option for zero. Charles Sweeney 13k'ish Rob 54,857 3223 And here we are, uploading our mug and stuff to skynet. That'll make their job far easier *runs into a bunker with tinfoil hat on* In all seriousness, this has helped alleviate loads of storage issues, especially for phones with smaller storage :) Jesse Lee I didn't see the article on installed apps, so wasn't as surprised to see 11K photos saved but instead, that I've installed 1,355 apps. Holy moly that seems like a lot. Francisco Peña 1,068 albums 14,376 Photos Pär Parbring 90800, I synced my entire library to Google photos... Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750. Due in no small part to the fact that I've been wearing Glass for the past four years, though. Ste Tan Man I thought I had so many at 18,751 photos but dayaum, all of ya'll in the comments are 50k+. Lol. I really do love Google Photos! :P johdaxx I took a few hundred here at my desk this morning to get to the next category...Felt I needed to level up before posting. jdrch I don't use the service because I find it pointless, so I have no idea. Kody 84k Berni Hargrove So apparently I'm just some weird fringe user that has less than a thousand photos. Something must be wrong with me for just living life, and letting most of everyone else do the photo work. Only a matter of time before we have people taking photos of people taking photos. Nathan J 20,793. Includes every picture I've taken with one iPhone, six Android phones, a bunch of flip phones, and various point and shoot and disposable cameras. Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over. Let it back them up while you're out and about. myssi Wondering how much it costs to Google to save all these bazillions of photos; that too for an app which earns $0. Leroy Filon 132.068 photos.

Rosh Mathew This is for people who have 40,000 photos synced. Do you ever get the feeling that - OK IM KINDA GETTING TIRED OF SNAPPING AWAY DURING A VACATION THAN ACTUALLY ENJOYING the moment? Years later, that foggy feeling that I spent so much time taking photos that I don't remember the vacation at all? And when you do have some time to sit down and reminisce, going through thousands of snaps feels exhausting, and there is too much emphasis on quantity of snaps than QUALITY? (I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

[Update: Fixed] It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 12:04pm PDTJun 5, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares53 Google Google Home News Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google has updated the thread to say all issues have been addressed. If you still have problems, try restarting.

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior.

That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All of them. ericshmerick How's the sodium level of that snack? Salty? Salty. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Spencer I've been having the same issue. I'm considering switching it from my 5Ghz network to my 2.4Ghz just to see if that makes a difference... Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime. Curtis Bond So this is what worked for me. Every time I used the hot-phrase it would spit out the same error, but once my wife used the hot-phrase, it started working perfectly. After that neither of us had issues. I'm pretty sure it's a software problem that's related to voice recognition. Also, big ups to AP for posting this. If Google is going to be serious about consumer electronics, they've got to stay on top of nonsense like this. A widespread failure like this should be unacceptable, and frankly should have been fixed already. Kyle Kepner I have five Google homes and 3 of them are wonky right now. Resets did not help ericshmerick Resetting will do nothing. It's a problem with ~the cloud~ LondonLeedsFan Is this feature available in the UK? Bruce Wayne And we want to trust these people to drive our cars autonomously. LOL. YuCMi Wouldn't it just chill your spine to hear your car saying, "Hmmm, something went wrong," while on a busy expressway? Đức Thành If you ever consider writing a script for a horror movie, please know that I'd like to read it and direct its movie. Just saying. YaKillaCJ I would rather have Wayne Tech JD Seeing as how they had Real life RC-able atomic powered cars in 1966 and a fully automatic self driving voice controlled car by 1989 I approve. DJ JoJo I was able to get mine working by going into home app, clicking upper right devices button. Next to Google home pic was "ready for multi user" prompt. I clicked it and trained my voice and it's working with no problems now. I had already power cycled and rebooted but that didn't work until I clicked on prompt. Defenestratus it didn't work for me for literally 3 minutes. Then it worked again. abc To be fair, it's a beta product. Bugs can happen. :) SunnyStroker Yep, that's Google! Always half Baked, always in Beta. Daniel Including Android right? I think we can cut them some slack considering how many things they give us for free. JD Its not free You are the product #productception KSubedi Almost returned mine because of that because I thought mine was defective unit. drkarlp I had mine for 9 months....I think it happened once - I re booted and all was fine. I love Google Home ! ericshmerick Wow...a positive poster. Everything okay? Garrett Johnson Fun fact. Holding the Microphone off button for 15 will do a factory data reset. According to Google's help center page you can not do a FDR from the app. Only reboot. That being said it didn't fix it for me Lars Jeppesen No issues on my GHomes located in Denmark and Brazil. Maybe a US only thing? John "OK Google, add HomePod to my shopping list." "Umm, something went wrong." ericshmerick All 3 of mine have been instantly throwing an error when I say "Hey Google." Been going on for a few days. Maddening. Markg55 All fixed. That was quick.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up.

Gearhead episode one: the rise of AI assistants, Nokia's 3310 and Mark Ronson talks studio tech Gearhead episode one: the rise of AI assistants, Nokia's 3310 and Mark Ronson talks studio tech Podcast 3 days ago The announcement, made at the company's 2017 Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) today in San Jose, was one of the year's worst-kept tech secrets and was widely predicted. The device will retail at $349, come in white and space grey and will be available in the UK in December. The UK price will be announced later this year, although Apple did not say when. ADVERTISEMENT By comparison, the Google Home comes in at £129 and Amazon’s prime Alexa-powered device, Echo, is £150, with the Echo Dot available for just £50. Of Amazon's other Alexa-enabled devices, perhaps most anticipated is the Echo Show, its "hands-free camera and style assistant", with its 7-inch colour screen at $230 in the US (no UK release date is announced yet). Apple hopes its HomePod will rival the Amazon Echo, Google Home and the coming Essential Home. To make up ground on competitors, the HomePod will have a seven tweeter beamform array plus a subwoofer inside, besting the current audio tech on these rival devices. READ NEXT Behold Apple's new iPads: the 10.5-inch and 12.5-inch iPad Pro Behold Apple's new iPads: the 10.5-inch and 12.5-inch iPad Pro By Victoria Woollaston Despite delivering what could never be described as unerring responses, Amazon's Echo and Google's Home have still created a new market for voice recognition AI assistants designed specifically for the home. Subscribe to WIRED In an attempt to make it look like it is not following behind the pack and is, in fact, going its own way, Apple is trying to market the HomePod as a smart music system that just happens to also be able to answer spoken questions and commands thanks to the six on-board mics. It can additionally handle HomeKit duties by voice prompts or even remotely via the app. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Apple adds new MacBooks, iMacs and the 'all-powerful' iMac Pro Apple adds new MacBooks, iMacs and the 'all-powerful' iMac Pro By Victoria Woollaston Inside, the brains of the HomePod happen to be the same A8 chip that powers the iPhone, making the speaker one of the most powerful of its kind when it comes to market. Looking at the design of the HomePod, it has a 3D mesh outer shell and light display on the top to indicate when Siri is listening. Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller previously hinted that the smart speaker would have a screen, commenting: "So there are many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations". It is something of a surprise, then, that the HomePod does not have an on-board display. The shipping date later this year means the HomePod comes out a full two years after Amazon launched Echo. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Apple's WWDC 2017 will return to San Jose in June Apple's WWDC 2017 will return to San Jose in June By Victoria Woollaston Going along with the typical Apple aesthetic, the HomePod is clearly meant to look high-end and expensive, with “excellent” sound quality thanks to those seven tweeters and subwoofer. Two HomePods can be linked to provide stereo pairing, which sets it somewhat against Sonos, while each 7-inch-tall speaker attempts, through some clever DSP, to split individual elements of a song to offer "spatial sound". The speaker will also work with your existing Apple Music subscription and have access to your music library and playlists. READ NEXT Apple WWDC 2016: iOS 10, Apple TV OS and Siri updates expected later today Apple WWDC 2016: iOS 10, Apple TV OS and Siri updates expected later today By Lee Bell Apple's AI assistant Siri was launched in 2011, and was not an instant hit - nor were original AI assistants on other platforms. However, consumers have found that talking to an assistant while on the move in the street is very different to interacting with a smart speaker in the home, which is how Amazon had such success with the Echo, shifting a reported 11 million devices by the end of 2016. Bolstering its support of this in-house AI assistant, as well as revealing the HomePod, Apple has launched a Siri-based watch face as part of watchOS4, describing it as "an intelligent proactive assistant right on your wrist" that "displays the information users need most throughout the day using Siri intelligence" such as traffic delay information to usual commutes. ADVERTISEMENT Alexa's popularity, despite its unreliability experienced by WIRED, is rooted in the fact that, thanks to opening up the system to third-party developers, it has more than 12,000 “Skills” that help users implement voice-activated smart home tech in their homes. Apple clearly hopes to win the AI-assistant race on the design front and by pitching this as a speaker, capitalising on the fact that it already has millions of devices in homes across the world, as well as its own home automation platform, HomeKit. It's the company's strong association with music that allows it to, initially at least, positioned the HomePod mainly as an AI-powered music speaker. Tim Cook said on introducing the device that Apple wants "to reinvent home music". They may well do this, but they also want a large slice of the home digital assistant market, despite coming to the party late.

The security patch is rolling out over-the-air and can also be downloaded directly if you’re not one for waiting. In addition to bolstering the security of its devices, Android Police points out that Google included a pretty important Pixel software fix in this update: a nasty bug that has resulted in some Pixel smartphones randomly freezing has supposedly been fixed. Well, hopefully. A post on Google’s product forums confirms that the fix “should address many of the freezing issues that have been reported.” Count me as one of the unlucky ones; my Pixel has been completely locking up at unpredictable times — at least once or twice a day — for months. And it rarely recovers or snaps out of it, so I usually have to hold down the power button for a hard reset whenever the freezes occur. (Yes, the Pixel’s camera is so good that it makes putting up with this stuff worth it.) Not all Pixel devices exhibit the issue. My colleague Vlad hasn’t encountered it at all, for example. I’m installing the OTA right now, so I’m trying to be optimistic that the freezing will vanish for good. But the company warns that “freezing and general device performance issues can be caused my many different things” so Google is encouraging users to report back on whether it truly alleviates the problem. Now if only Google could improve the Pixel’s Bluetooth performance...

Apple revealed HomePod, its Siri-powered smart speaker, during the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, according to CNET. But while consumers likely will view the device as the latest addition to a market currently dominated by Amazon and Google, Apple has bigger plans for its new product. Reportedly releasing in December for $349, HomePod will cost nearly twice as much as the Amazon Echo and almost three times as much as the Google Home, which cost $179 and $129, respectively. The reason for the higher price tag is Apple’s apparent emphasis on sound quality, something sorely lacking from Amazon’s products. “Just like with portable music, we want to reinvent home music,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at WWDC. In addition to the various types of aid current smart speakers provide, HomePod features what Apple calls “spacial awareness,” which allows the device to sense room size and occupying furniture to adjust audio as needed, according to CNET. With the heavy focus on audio, HomePod appears positioned more to rival Bose and other similarly priced home speaker units. The fact that HomePod isn’t copying some of Amazon’s recent Echo updates seems to further support this notion, which was rumored by industry experts in the weeks leading up to HomePod’s reveal. Only time will tell, though, if the voices of Siri, Google and Alexa will be the soundtrack to our high-tech apocalypse.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Netflix's CEO Compares His Company to Facebook and Google What do these tech giants tell us about Netflix's international growth prospects? Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Jun 5, 2017 at 4:41PM Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) isn't exactly in the same business as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Sure, Facebook and Google both do video, but Netflix is all about premium content. Nonetheless, CEO Reed Hastings thinks his company has the same mass appeal as both companies, and that bodes well for Netflix's international subscriber growth. "Most of our growth now is international," Hastings said at Re/Code's Code Conference. "We're about 50/50 in terms of memberships. And if you look at the big internet companies like YouTube and Facebook, they're 80%-85% international and 15% domestic. So we have a long way to go in international." Considering Netflix still believes it has a good amount of growth left domestically, the streaming service could be absolutely huge if Hastings' assertion is correct. Image source: Netflix. Just how international are Facebook and YouTube? Facebook is nice enough to break down its users by geographical territories. It lumps the U.S. in with its neighbor to the north, Canada, which combined to have 234 million users as of the end of last quarter. That's just 12.1% of Facebook's 1.94 billion users. That's an even smaller percentage than Hastings threw out in his conversation at Re/Code. Google isn't as forthcoming with YouTube statistics. According to research group Socialbakers, 80% of YouTube users come from other countries. That said, both Facebook and YouTube are free for users, generating revenue through advertisements. Netflix, however, requires subscribers to pay. Facebook and Google's domestic revenue split may give a better indication of what's attainable for Netflix. Last quarter, U.S. and Canadian users generated 49% of Facebook's revenue. Alphabet generated 48% of its revenue from the United States. Meanwhile, Netflix generated 58% of streaming revenue from the U.S. in the first quarter. So while Netflix does have some ground to make up internationally, it might not be as big of a gap as Hastings is indicating because of the lower average buying power of international Facebook and YouTube users. A better split may be closer to the 65/35 international-domestic subscriber split of HBO and Cinemax. Netflix is still growing domestically Surely, there's still a lot of growth left for Netflix -- both internationally and domestically. The company believes it can reach between 60 million and 90 million domestic subscribers in the long term. With 50 million members already, it may be just a couple more years before it reaches the bottom edge of that projection. And if it gets there that quickly, it bodes well for its continued growth up toward the top of the projection. The continued growth of Netflix's profitable domestic subscribers will provide Netflix with cash to fuel its international growth with new local originals. The company is investing aggressively around the world with new localized content, and it's had several modest international hits, such as 3% from Brazil. It's important to remember that Netflix is still only about a year and a half into many international markets. The customer ramp-up ought to be more accelerated than domestically because of better brand recognition and everything Netflix has learned over the past decade of domestic streaming. Still, it's going to take time for Netflix to fill out its catalog in every market with compelling originals and must-see licensed shows and films to give it the same mass appeal as it has in the United States. Even as domestic subscribers continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than just a couple of years ago, international subscriber ought to outpace it for a long time to come. And if Netflix succeeds in reaching its long-term view, that means a lot more international subscribers have yet to sign up.

Photograph: Apple/EPA Apple Apple unveils HomePod speaker to take on Amazon Echo and Google Home Smart speaker announced along with new iMac Pro coming in December while iMacs and MacBook Pros get immediate spec bumps Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Olivia Solon in San Francisco @oliviasolon email Monday 5 June 2017 17.23 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 6 June 2017 02.24 EDT Apple is launching a smart home speaker called HomePod to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home devices, the company revealed at its annual worldwide developer conference. iMac Pro: Apple launches powerful new desktop – starting at $4,999 Read more The Cupertino company described the 7in device, which comes in white and “space grey”, as a “breakthrough home speaker” designed to “rock the house”. This means that Apple has placed an emphasis on audio quality, packing the speaker with an array of seven tweeters and a woofer as well as “spatial awareness” that detects its location in a room and adapts the output automatically. In announcing the HomePod, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were many companies making products for enjoying music in the home but “none have nailed it yet”. He mentioned wireless speaker systems such as Sonos that “sound good but are not smart” and “other smart speakers” (presumably a reference to Amazon Echo and Google Home) that “don’t sound great”. “We want to combine this all,” he said. HomePod is controlled using Siri, the company’s voice-activated personal assistant, which has, according to Apple, been trained to be better at answering questions about music such as “Hey Siri, who’s the drummer in this?” “Apple reinvented portable music with iPod, and now HomePod will reinvent how we enjoy music wirelessly throughout our homes,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing. The device can also be used to send messages, get updates on news, sports and weather and control smart home devices connected using Apple’s HomeKit. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the Homepod. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images At $349, it will be more expensive than Google Home ($109) and Amazon Echo ($179) but cheaper than the Sonos Play 5 ($499). The product will launch in the US, UK and Australia in December 2017 and in other markets in 2018. “I think it’s a very Apple-esque product in that it seeks to stake out the high end of a market with its technology, price and positioning,” said analyst Paul Erickson from IHS Markit. However, Erickson described the price point as “aspirational” given that consumer expectations have been set by cheaper competitors, “although Apple has done a great job of being extremely profitable without having to cater to the mainstream, and they will drop their price over time”, he said. Besides the HomePod, Apple unveiled a collection of new and upgraded products, including a new computer, the $4,999 iMac Pro. The more powerful iMac is intended to address concerns of creative professionals who had been limited to much less powerful iMacs or the much-loved Mac Pro, which hasn’t been updated since 2013. There was also a new 10.5in version of the iPad Pro, the tablet for professional users, which can support a full-sized keyboard cover. The device has a better display, is faster, and comes with 64GB of memory. The device will start at $649 and start shipping next week. There’s also a 12.9in version that starts at $799. “We’ve been pushing the boundary of iPads, and today, we’re going to push them further than we ever have before,” Cook said. Just as Google and Facebook did at their developer conferences this year, Apple announced an augmented reality platform called ARKit to allow developers to more easily create augmented reality apps, such as Pokémon Go, which overlay digital objects on to the real world. Apple’s senior vice-president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, demonstrated the company’s AR capabilities by placing a virtual coffee cup, lamp and vase onto a real table. Given that it is already supported by millions of iPads and iPhones it will, Federighi said, “be the largest AR platform in the world”. There were also a couple of updates to Apple’s web browser, Safari, including a speed boost that makes it, according to Apple, the fastest ever desktop browser. It also introduced autoplay blocking, which stops music and video from playing automatically without your permission on websites as well as “intelligent tracking prevention”, which stops ads from following you around the web.

The formation of the coalition, which was first reported by Recode, is headed up by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has been coordinating an effort to have the group be formally recognized by the United Nations. The list of over 1,000 groups includes powerful global tech firms like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook; transportation companies like Tesla, Lyft, and Uber; and notable design corporations like Adobe, Autodesk, Skanska, and Perkins + Will; as well as dozens of smaller architecture, engineering, and infrastructure firms. A statement on the the website We Are Still In outlines how coordinated actions from industry and education can bolster complementary work by local and regional governments and allow the U.S. to fulfill its commitments to the Paris agreement: In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions. We Are Still In is one of many groups that have formed to endorse the Paris accord after President Trump’s announcement, including 211 mayors of the Climate Mayors, and 13 governors who make up the United States Climate Alliance. What’s notable is that the We Are Still In statement was coordinated among over a dozen groups working on collective climate action, including Climate Mayors and the United States Climate Alliance; city-focused alliances like Bloomberg Philanthropies, C40, and National League of Cities; and environmental organizations like the Rocky Mountain Institute, Sierra Club, and the World Wildlife Fund. One reason the inclusion of businesses is so critical in the conversation is that corporations drive consumer choices and shape buying habits, especially when it comes to the adoption of new technologies like solar panels and electric vehicles. Companies can also illustrate the economic impact of the climate accord—that moving to renewable energy and reducing emissions can contribute to job creation and market growth. The Trump administration has made the argument that the opposite is true, and that adhering to the Paris agreement will cost the country $3 trillion. Corporations are now including climate disclosure in financial reports, where they must outline the risks and advantages to shareholders, so they already know the benefits, notes Lynelle Cameron, VP of Sustainability for Autodesk, in a statement. “We are ready to capitalize on this business opportunity, creating both jobs and profit for shareholders,” she says. “At Autodesk, we are all in, and are more committed than ever to enlist our customers to design, build and manufacture net positive climate solutions.” Next Up In News Apple HomePod wants to take on Amazon Echo, Google Home, Sonos We Are Still In: The plan to keep U.S. in line with the Paris accord 246 mayors adopt Paris climate accord after U.S. pulls out (updated) Cities light up green in support of Paris climate agreement Architects can lead climate change fight as U.S. pulls out of Paris Accord Sanctuary cities fight back against new immigration restrictions Trending 4 all-in-one security systems for your smart home The dawn of the Internet of Things has made keeping an eye on your home that much easier. 5 affordable modern prefab houses you can buy right now Some prefab homes out there can go for upwards of $500,000 each.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers the opening keynote address the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on June 5, 2017 in San Jose, California. (AFP Photo) Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Tech Ethereum, an alternative cryptocurrency to bitcoin, hit its all-time...

The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple's HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple's first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences.'' But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. An Apple employee helps a member of the media try on an HTC Vive while testing the virtual reality capabilities of the new iMac during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California on June 5. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency'' format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, California (AP) - Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year.

It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch.

The new tool, called Ad Experience Report, measures how well a site’s ads comply with the Better Ads Standards, which are determined by the Coalition for Better Ads. Publishers can also refer to Google’s new best practices guide. Google’s Ad Experience Report displays screenshots and videos which specifically identify the annoying ad experiences on a site so publishers know what they need to fix. The online advertising giant plans to continue its crusade against annoying ads by having Chrome automatically block them in early 2018. Specifically, Google will stop showing ads within Chrome that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards. In addition, later this year, Google will offer “Funding Choices” to publishers. This will give them the option to allow visitors to pay a fee to remove all ads on a site. Funding Choices is a measure by Google to thwart the use of ad blockers while helping publishers earn more money. “We believe these changes will ensure all content creators, big and small, can continue to have a sustainable way to fund their work with online advertising.” ADVERTISEMENT Related Posts Google Launches New Mobile Friendly Testing Tool Google to Site Owners: Create More AMP Pages Google Releases Tool to Help Filter Out Hurtful Comments Online ADVERTISEMENT Matt Southern Lead News Writer at Search Engine Journal Matt Southern has been the lead news writer at Search Engine Journal since 2013.

The fight has been taken to every social media platform, including WhatsApp, Google, Facebook and Twitter. The massive investments in digital messaging could well revolutionise political campaigns in Kenya as both Jubilee and NASA step up customised approaches to win voters. President Uhuru Kenyatta’s team and that of his main rival Raila Odinga have made heavy investments in digital media. Meant to complement their big political rallies, the two are determined to reach out to potential voters at the convenience of their target audience through all channels, including their phones. A day after Raila was named NASA presidential candidate, someone paid Google to promote a website named “The Real Raila Odinga”, full of negative stories and claims that the Opposition candidate is corrupt, violent, crooked and a liar. It also makes unsubstantiated allegations, including claims that “Raila faked food poisoning to avoid a meeting with other NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang’ula”. It was referring to an incident in March this year when he was admitted at the Karen Hospital after he fell ill. The top search result for Raila on Google is “The Real Raila Odinga” website, clearly marked as an advert. Analyst Mutahi Nguyi has also set up several platforms on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, where he has been posting articles and videos of why Kenyans should not elect Raila. “After the last election, Human Rights Watch found that Raila and ODM was helping coordinate the riots throughout Kenya,” one of the posts on Facebook states, rekindling memories of the deadly 2007/2008 post-election violence. The website claims that NASA Pentagon members have previously traded accusations against each other and are now hugging on political podiums without resolving issues. In one of the videos on the controversial website, Raila in a 2002 rally accuses his co-principal Musalia Mudavadi and retired President Daniel Moi of having been the architects of the Goldenberg scam. In a recent interview, Raila insisted that Musalia was cleared of the multi-billion-shilling scam that nearly brought Kenya to its knees. Raila's team on the other hand has hired influential bloggers with millions of followers on social media to lead its dirty campaigns. Some of the bloggers use pseudonyms to comment on stories published by mainstream news organisations. The bloggers continuously collect, monitor and analyse messages from Jubilee before responding to them almost instantly. The Raila team has also been creating and widely circulating videos rubbishing Jubilee's achievements. But Uhuru’s strategists have taken the campaigns to an all-time high, with leading international data firms already on board. Global data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, contracted by Uhuru, occupies the entire seventh floor of the eight-storey Jubilee Centre in Pangani. CA is said to be capable of trawling Facebook and buying up commercial consumer datasets to identify 'persuadable' voters. An expose by the Guardian newspaper of the UK last month claimed that CA, in conjunction with its sister company AggregateIQ in Vancouver, Canada, essentially won the Brexit vote using the same strategy. It then bombards the persuadable voters with more than a billion social media posts and adverts. Cambridge Analytica is credited with helping Candidate Donald Trump to win the American presidential election last November and with helping the Leave side to win in the Brexit referendum in the UK last June. It has been described as a “psychological warfare firm”. But apart from the global firms, both Jubilee and NASA have also invested in local tech-savvy teams drawn from the information and communications technology industry. ODM Secretary General Agnes Zani told the Star that they are “handling every component of our campaigns seriously”, declining to divulge their online strategy. The Raila team has turned a widely advertised video on Jubilee delivery achievements against the ruling party. The video's adverts, currently running on TV, showcase what Jubilee describes as its achievements over the past four-and-a-half years is dubbed “A Journey of Transformation”. But in the corrupted video, widely shared on WhatsApp groups, NASA terms the Jubilee tenure “A Journey of Gimmicks and PR Stunts”. They chide Jubilee for claiming to have transformed the country's healthcare, yet Sh5 billion was allegedly lost at the Ministry of Health’s Afya House headquarters in what has come to be known as the MafyaHouse scandal. Questions over the handling of donor money at the Ministry of Health led to suspension of Sh2.5 billion funding from the US government. “A healthier Kenya? Sh5 billion looted. USAID suspended funding. 100 days’ doctors strike,” part of the text in a 1 minute, 38-second video reads. “Food security? Brokers and middlemen making billions at the expense of farmers and hungry Kenya,” it adds. The video that ends with the voice of Musalia urging NASA supporters to vote out Jubilee also claims that the Sh338 billion Standard Gauge Railway is not economically viable. Sources privy to activities in NASA promised it will be an emotional campaign, where both videos will be played and Jubilee statements used to show Kenyans how they have been suffering. “We have enough content to push on all media platforms and a strong team to broadcast the best,” said a source at Capitol Hill. Opposition bloggers believe the government harasses them for telling the truth. They argue pushing the government to address historical injustices amounts to hate speech. Both the NASA and JP teams use a Twitter deck, which offers a more convenient experience by letting people view multiple timelines in one easy interface. The deck hosts advanced features to get the most of social network support. It manages multiple accounts, the schedule for posting and builds Tweet collections, among other features. Jubilee and NASA believe they can capitalise on social media users to reach out to millions of voters through a ripple effect. Besides, there is Uhuru's own Facebook page and Twitter handle that has about 3.068 million likes and 2.13 million followers, respectively. Here, Uhuru’s team actively post his schedule, campaign videos, and press statements. Raila on the other hand has 1.07 million followers on Twitter and 816,998 likes on Facebook.

A. Verdin (name redacted for privacy) isn't the only person who allegedly scammed review keys from video game PR representatives and developers, but he's one of the few who got caught. Verdin – AKA "BattlefieldAxe," "Airo95," "RaphaAaron," and "James Rodriguez" – has a reputation among publishers and PR reps for running game key scams; a con where the scammer falsifies some manner of credential in order to score free download keys for video games, often indie titles. In Verdin's case, he's almost certainly impersonated a member of Twitter's verification team and the PlayStation UK team, as well as allegedly impersonated representatives from EA, Square Enix, Bethesda, and Friday the 13th developer Gun Media. Although it's unclear how falsifying Twitter credentials figured into his alleged scam, Verdin reportedly obtained "about 50 keys" for the Friday the 13th: The Game beta as well as multiple Battlefield beta keys. Since then, he's allegedly posted a since-deleted apology on Twitter, where he offered to reimburse the companies he's scammed via PayPal. This was approximately seven months ago, back in October 2016 – based on this screenshot. Although most of the screenshots we've obtained have been from second-hand sources, we've been able to conclusively verify that Verdin's current Twitter account once went by the handles accused of key scamming. The only thing we've been unable to confirm is whether Verdin ever apologized. Two months after the apology, Verdin allegedly went back to his old ways by implying he was a member of the Friday the 13th: The Game development team on Twitter. Verdin initially responded to request for comment, but went silent after asking me what my plans were for the article. The allegations surrounding Verdin won't be surprising to anyone who works in game development or PR. It's the age-old tale of people willing to pull some shady business in order to get free stuff. But since this is the video game industry, the whole ordeal has to be infinitely more complex than just stealing a loaf of bread from a grocery store. Becky Taylor, a game developer/businessperson/PR rep known for working with Reboot Magazine and Innervate, was the person who clued me into Verdin's reputation ("he called me a cunt and blocked me for calling him out"), although Square Enix Senior CM Cat Karskens and Bithell Games' Mike Futter aren't big fans either. Taylor's experience is notable, in part because she could point to a man with a name and say "he did it." Most of the time, you don't even get that unless you have deep pockets and a lot of free time.  We initially confirmed that Verdin previously owned the @BattlefieldAxe, @Airo95, @RaphaAaron, and @JrodriguezVT accounts by Googling the respective Twitter URLs. Thanks to Google's cache, we found that some Tweets associated with the old handle were connected to the new one, confirming our suspicions. The Tweets either took the form of redirected posts or replies from other accounts. We also manually combed through nearly 3,000 Tweets "liked" from Verdin's current account, where he had interacted with people manually replying to his old handles. Be warned, that link is very NSFW – the guy likes porn and isn't afraid to show it. I've scrolled through so many bare asses while reporting this story, I think I'm 100% desensitized to nudity. Although Verdin allegedly did most of his work on Twitter, most scammers prefer more traditional forms of communication. "I can't tell you how many fake emails I used to get a day when I worked at a development studio. Hell, I still get them – and I get them asking for keys for free-to-play games on Steam because they will literally copy paste the same email," Taylor said. "Most of the time, it's them claiming to be a Russian YouTuber, or that they have a huge Steam group I should support." The PR representatives I spoke with for this story corroborated Taylor's statements, including Zoink Games PR and Marketing Manager Mikael Forslind, who extensively documented his experience with a Russian YouTube channel. "The most elaborate scam [we encountered] was the YouTube channel that rebrands the whole channel every now and then, " Forslind said. "So, the scammer creates a YouTube channel and calls it something like 'Mike's Gaming Channel.' They add correct artwork, register an email something like mikes_gamingchannel@gmail.com. Then [they add] a few videos, normally just recorded videos with gameplay and no editing work or voice-over work. Then they register their channel on sites that deal with key requests and my guess is that they just request all games they come across," Forslind said. "I fell for that, which makes me furious." Forslind attached a Google Sheets document that lists some of the scammers he's encountered, along with screenshots from a YouTube channel that has rebranded multiple times over the course of its short existence. In fact, it changed from "FancyFish" to "UnendingGaming" while this article was being written. Although you can see many hallmarks of the channel rebranding con – new icons, new staffers, clear form letter, etc. –  the scammer failed to obfuscate the identical channel URL. It's hard to glean much from Unending Gaming's miasma of Russian Let's Plays and low-quality gameplay footage, but there are a few early videos boasting "The Rock Gaming" branding – proving the channel once went by a completely different name. One TRG-branded video in particular is just opera singing over a Windows desktop. There's also the story of J. Carmona, AKA "TheKamikazeYT," who became infamous on Reddit for allegedly reselling game keys he had obtained from developers. "[Carmona] went rogue and simply started selling all the keys he got from developers on G2A. He was already on lots of mailing lists and perhaps is still getting free keys from developers, who are unaware that he is using them for profit," said Yulia Vakhrusheva, the Director of PR at TinyBuild. "Believe it or not, but he still reaches out to us, trying to get keys even though he was outed many times!" "I confronted him, and I said 'Sorry, you are associated with scamming tons of video game developers and selling the provided game keys on G2A. You will need to buy all the games from now on,'" Vakhrusheva said. Although Carmona's alleged new YouTube account ZurLoko shares a business contact email with TheKamikazeYT, it's somewhat less suspicious – in part because he gets a decent amount of comments and likes/dislikes. Most of the content on his new channel seems legitimate, and although I don't speak Spanish, it does sound like the same guy. The only thing on ZurLoko worth noting is a referral link to G2A – a grey market for download keys we've covered extensively on this website, and a place where Carmona could have sold game keys with little to no oversight. "This specific encounter didn't come up in our communication with G2A, but this is something that we see all the time. We brought several people to G2A's attention, but even when they are banned, they can just create a new account and continue their shady business," Vakhrusheva said. "It's a perpetual loop." G2A came up multiple times in my conversations with PR and developers, in part because the contentious relationship between G2A and the rest of the games industry only gets more volatile with each passing day. Although a GameStop equivalent for digital downloads wouldn't be the worst thing in the world (can you imagine being able to offload all those extra Humble Bundle keys with ease?), G2A has been at the center of many controversies, including a story on Kotaku where a key scammer endorsed G2A as a good place to fence stolen goods and a feature on this very outlet where yours truly accidentally purchased stolen property off the marketplace. Vakhrusheva believes that G2A's open market is partially to blame for the plague of key scammers, since it's so easy to just turn around and sell keys. "We think that every company distributing our product needs to be authorized by us. If we had that level of control, it would drastically hurt gray marketplace and key scammers," Vakhrusheva said. Raw Fury's David Martinez put it a little more succinctly. "If someone really wants to play our games for cheap then we'd understand if they 'borrow' our titles from a 'friend.' We'd rather they do that instead of giving money to G2A's 'business,'" Martinez said. When reached for comment, G2A did not tell us of any specific plans to combat fraud on the platform. "Actual instances of fraud on G2A are extremely low," said G2A head of PR Maciej Kuc in an email interview, claiming the site's percentage of fraudulent transactions was "far below" one percent. "The illegitimate or stolen key narrative is just a farce. What developers dislike is that we empower consumers – that's what has found us so many enemies." Becky Taylor disagrees. "The fight is usually 'Why shouldn't customers be able to sell their unused keys – or resell games like GameStop does?' Well, that's the big question right there. Could G2A redeem itself if they were able to block stolen keys easily?" Taylor said. "Though, there might have been a tussle [regarding stolen product at GameStop] at some point, I truly don't believe GameStop has even 1% the same amount of stolen games as G2A." Although we cannot verify the level of fraud conducted at GameStop or G2A, GameStop is somewhat protected by state-level secondhand dealer laws in the United States. When trading games in my home state of New York, I had to provide an address and some form of government ID. Florida requires a physical description and a "right thumbprint." Three years ago, Philadelphia GameStops came under fire for taking the fingerprints of trade-in customers. eBay is maybe a better 1:1 comparison than GameStop, but I can't imagine anyone looking to offload stolen goods would bother with shipping items across the country when they could sell them locally for cash. According to Kuc, G2A's current seller verification process requires users to provide a phone number, a social media account "with history," and a PayPal account. It took me about a minute to figure out how to set up a dummy PayPal account – I already knew about Google Voice and the myriad of ways you can make a social media account look real. I brought this to Kuc's attention, but he insisted the site would still be able to ferret out scammers. "While someone could put in the time to set up a seller’s account that is not tied to their personal information, they will always have to provide us with that personal information if they want to withdraw their money from G2A," Kuc said. He also told Destructoid that G2A is developing "an even more detailed verification process," but declined to share any details, as the process is still "in the end stages of development." In response to game key fraud, developers and PR firms have created whole sites to combat the issue, like Vlambeer's Do Distribute or Evolve PR's Terminals. There's also the relatively new Woovit and KeyMailer, which specialize in connecting YouTubers/streamers to game publishers. These websites restrict key access to verified individuals – this doesn't completely eliminate key scammers, but it certainly helps weed them out. "The other day I got a request on Do Distribute from a guy who wrote for 'a website' and just linked awebsite.com," said Mikael Forslind. "That's hilarious." Tom Ohle, the director of Evolve PR, spoke with us about their key management site Terminals, which is currently exclusive to Evolve clients – although the company plans to open the site to other developers "sometime in June." "We absolutely deal with key scammers all the time, and we built Terminals – in part, at least – as a solution to the issue. In fact, we get so many requests from key scammers – I'd say a good half-dozen a week, and that's just the products I work on directly – that dealing with them has become so routine, and it's actually hard to pinpoint any particularly interesting ones," Ohle said. "We have the verification process in place on Terminals to help with this, and while it does mean we have to dedicate people's time to verify our contacts, I think it's worth it in the long run." Most of the PR reps I spoke with for this story cautioned independent developers without PR representation to not just hand out codes willy-nilly. Even if you think you're speaking with someone you recognize, be sure to double-check if you see anything even remotely suspicious. Even traditional media outlets can be impersonated – we were forwarded email correspondence where a particularly savvy con artist impersonated PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon and came pretty close to getting away with a bunch of keys. Eventually, key scammers will likely come up with a new way to fool developers, but for now, better to be safe than spending your free time hunting down fraudulent keys on G2A.

Picture: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images MARTYN LANDI 21:55 Monday 05 June 2017 Share this article 0 Have your say Apple will go head-to-head with rivals Amazon and Google, as the US tech giant throws its hat into the growing smart home arena. Apple boss Tim Cook took to the stage at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California to unveil the ‘HomePod’ speaker which he claimed will ‘reinvent home audio.’ The speaker will compete directly with Amazon’s Echo and Google Home for the lucrative smart speaker market. It will utilise Apple music and Siri to do everything from play music to control other smart home appliances. The device is just under seven inches tall and uses spacial awareness to improve how it sounds based on the acoustics and available space in its surrounding environment. “We want to reinvent music in the home in the way we invented mobile music,’ said Mr Cook, “we really think its going to take your home music experience to the next level.” The speaker, which will be available at £270 will act as general assistant in people’s homes. Since the launch of Amazon’s Echo last year and Google Home in March, both of which have been popular with consumers, Apple had been widely expected to enter the market. Chief executive Mr Cook, referencing the company’s iTunes service and iPod, said: “Just like portable music, we would like to reinvent home music.” The HomePod will use its internal microphones to pick up voice commands and uses the same processor chip as the iPhone to pump out “spatially aware” sound, Apple said. The tech giant confirmed the device would go on sale in December in the US, UK and Australia. Apple earlier introduced a new version of its iPad Pro, as well as a raft of new software updates. The new iPad Pro will have a 10.5-inch screen, placing it between the current 9.7 and 13-inch screens of Apple’s flagship tablet. The tech firm also updated its Apple Pay system to enable users to directly pay other people using a text message as part of its iOS 11 upgrade. The company’s TV app is also adding Amazon and its Prime Video service later this year for the first time. The next version of iOS, which powers the iPhone and iPad, as well as desktop software macOS and the Apple Watch’s watchOS were also updated at the firm’s Worldwide Developer Conference, WWDC. Apple boss Tim Cook said the event was “the best and biggest WWDC ever”. The technology giant also announced a new software kit for developers called ARKit, which will enabled app developers to build augmented reality apps on Apple’s platforms more easily. Augmented reality is a mixture of live images and virtual animations and objects placed over them. Apple also said it was making its virtual assistant Siri more aware of context, enabling it to recommend and remind users more accurately based on how they use their device. The firm said Siri will now better understand follow-up questions and scheduling as well as handle language translation for the first time. A preview of a new high-powered iMac Pro desktop, due to be released later this year, was also teased.

By Michael Liedtke and Barbara Ortutay / Associated Press SAN JOSE, California — Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Mac gets an upgrade Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Sizing up the iPad Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week.

Image credit: AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple's HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple's first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Mac gets an upgrade Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Watch the Watch Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Related Reads Apple Unveils 'Homepod' Speaker, First New Product In Years Apple's HomePod Speaker Pumps Up the Volume on Tech Rivals Apple's Developer's Conference May Highlight Artificial Intelligence Samsung Joins Digital Assistant Race With Acquisition Of Viv Advertisement Advertisement View the discussion thread.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said.

Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. See how St. Louis stocks are faring Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Weekend poll: How many photos are synced to your Google Photos account?

This week, we're doing Google Photos. To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below. So, how many photos are synced to your account? I'm at a little over 8,000 at this time, and that honestly doesn't seem like a lot to me (my Lightroom catalog contains over twice as many). I'll be curious to see how many of your break into the five-figure ranges. How many photos are on your Google Photos account? Under 100 100-999 1,000-2,499 2,500-4,999 5,000-9,999 10,000-19,999 20,000-39,999 More than 40,000. View Results  Loading ... Tags google+ photos photos sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Boolean Corporation the trick is to plug your iPhotos Library to the desktop uploader and see the magic happen. I have my Canon and SONY photos up there as well. ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before... After half a year with this career and therefore i obtained cash in sum Thirty six Thousand us dollars... Ordinarily I make up approximate to eighty bucks/h and work for three to four hours every single day.And excellent point about this task is the fact that you can supervise time and effort whenever you work and for just how long as you may like and you attain a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too vidvox That was the craziest thing about using my DSLR on a trip through Texas last year, looking at the photos online and seeing the correct GPS location on them! Tyler Humphreys My mom had some pictures of Siberia, California and Google Photos thought they were from Russia, just from an album named "Siberia". chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google Rob 54,857..... Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit. I feel like this would be a different story if I had something like the Pixel or Nexus 6P, or even the Nexus 5X instead. LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Jerry Suppan Wow!　And I thought I had too many at 51,000+. Well, I guess we can store our entire life from birth if if we include pre-digital era scanned photos. (^J^) Đức Thành That is a creepy thought but somehow I find it kind of exciting as well. Imagine storing all of our memories, thoughts and emotions on the cloud. Victor A backup of met-art archives? 😁 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Luqmaan Mathee "To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below." It's in the article. Teja Oops, missed that. Its 51,929 photos. :D Carl Draper Photos does not appear for me on that page Margaritas Ante Porcos omg! are breaking films into frames and then upload? lol Kenni Odelheim I said 20-40 as a guess, but it was 46k I found out afterwards... jesus man.. I snap alot :D sssgadget ~15000 Booyabobby 3075 Paul_Werner 26,263 photos currently dcdttu 47,793. I used the photos uploader on my desktop. Lexxior what happens if you do? dcdttu It uploads pictures. Jorim Tielemans 78,533 photo's, that's only 3 times the amount of my bookmarks 🤐 maybe that would be a cool poll for next weekend. Lexxior wtf 20000+ bookmarks?! Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999. BigTurk Beat me by almost 2000! I got my first digital camera in 2002. Kudos to you haha Richard Riker 13,148 Shaunak Guharay 18,679 . I expected it to be somewhere around 5000, but holy shit JW 12k Joshua Ferguson 61K, I've slowed down over the last couple of years Simps 11,222 photo's and 959 albums that I have not created. Boolean Corporation Also, people like to share their sites with me... it appears... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fbf6c5a8bcd2762fb0751916cddfc1c30c07e67b2f9bc325f16d5e39a091d222.png Stoffers I've also had 1,648,103 shared with my 2 sites. Boolean Corporation So it must be the total amount of public Google Sites out there. Dn Bro I have 8,973,294...I'm not really sure where they are. exadeci https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3db3521ceda62f5bd4e638a39d5ae74f7f04e770dc7485d7a198f8b445df4f99.png Anand Slightly higher than your count ;).

Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson. Akilesh Akil https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b22006051777d76bece05eecfcae428cdcf2381379fdc6e701e6c4f64988671.jpg Barron Roth I feel like I'm an edge case, Google Photos runs very slow for me 😔 an old screenshot, I probably broke 500k these days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d2363f77f2556cf6b91ee1f158be42694f8fcb74f9869a02f388dddcdc95e383.png Rob What are all those photos? Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file. Robert Porter Yes, any photo on Gphotos is analyzed. If they don't have the locations, I believe Google fills that info with your Google maps location during that time. HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote.

I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe.

Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440.

Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

Nathan J 20,793. Includes every picture I've taken with one iPhone, six Android phones, a bunch of flip phones, and various point and shoot and disposable cameras. Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over. Let it back them up while you're out and about. myssi Wondering how much it costs to Google to save all these bazillions of photos; that too for an app which earns $0. Leroy Filon 132.068 photos.

Rosh Mathew This is for people who have 40,000 photos synced. Do you ever get the feeling that - OK IM KINDA GETTING TIRED OF SNAPPING AWAY DURING A VACATION THAN ACTUALLY ENJOYING the moment? Years later, that foggy feeling that I spent so much time taking photos that I don't remember the vacation at all? And when you do have some time to sit down and reminisce, going through thousands of snaps feels exhausting, and there is too much emphasis on quantity of snaps than QUALITY? (I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

On another dramatic day for investors in America's technology giants, Alphabet rose as high as $1,007.40 on the stock market in New York. Google shares have jumped more than 1,900 per cent since they started trading at around $50 each in 2004, with the company now worth £535billion. The stock has risen nearly 40 per cent in the last 12 months. Although Amazon shares reached $1,000 first, there are fewer in circulation, meaning it is worth £378billion, some £157billion less than Alphabet. Google Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange for the first time in August 19, 2004 The rise in the Google share price came as tech firms were forced to defend their handling of extremist content following the latest terror attack in London. Theresa May called for areas of the internet to be closed because they provide a 'safe space' for terrorist ideology – piling pressure on YouTube owner Google, WhatsApp owner Facebook and Twitter to tackle extremist content.

Share this article Share But there is little sign of investor confidence in the tech giants waning with the so-called Faang stocks – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google – among the favourites. Technology stocks like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have soared this year, leaving other sectors in their wake. But the boom has fuelled fears in some quarters that a bust could be on the way. American tech firms dominate the list of the most valuable stock market-listed companies in the world, with Apple at number one followed by Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon.  GOOGLE FIGURES  £535bn: Google's value – bigger than Switzerland's economy £37bn: Wealth of founders Larry Page, 44, and Sergey Brin, 43 40,000: Google searches made every second 146 per cent: What Google's shares have grown by on average every year Apple is currently worth around £630billion. Apple revealed a number of new tech initiatives at its annual developers conference yesterday. The tech giant confirmed it had partnered with Amazon to bring Amazon Prime Video app to Apple TV, teased one of its most expensive iMacs worth £3,900 - due to be released in December - and revealed it was updating its popular Apply Pay cash transfer service so that users can send cash to friends with their fingerprints. It also revealed it would be upgrading the Apple Watch so it can sync to treadmills and share workout data. The extraordinary success of the US tech industry has made their founders billions. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, 61, is said by Bloomberg to be worth £69billion while Amazon's Jeff Bezos, 53, has amassed a £66billion fortune and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, 33, is worth £50billion. Google entrepreneurs Larry Page, 44, and Sergey Brin, 43, are worth around £37billion each. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the technology sector was their top pick at the moment. A separate report by Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest, said investors should sell Apple shares and buy Google with the proceeds. He said Alphabet shares offered 'an excellent risk-reward profile and more substantial upside potential' than Apple. Google's advertising revenues jumped 19 per centin the first quarter of the year to £16.6billion as companies ramped up marketing online. Alphabet has also invested heavily in areas such as cloud-computing, artificial intelligence, voice-computing and even driverless cars as it looks for new sources of revenue. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car unit, could be worth more than £50billion by 2030. The value of Google owner Alphabet is already higher than the gross domestic product of Switzerland, the 19th largest economy in the world. Apple is worth more than the GDP of the Netherlands, the world's 18th biggest economy. Microsoft founder Gates is worth around the same amount as the entire national output of Slovakia and more than Sri Lanka, Kenya or Luxembourg.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched Money videos Should you worry about the election and your investments?

Credit: Bloomberg News Most Popular After blocking Google users from reading free articles in February, The Wall Street Journal's subscription business soared, with a fourfold increase in the rate of visitors converting into paying customers. But there was a trade-off: Traffic from Google plummeted 44%. That's because Google search results are based on an algorithm that scans the internet for free content. After the Journal's free articles went behind a paywall, Google's bot only saw the first few paragraphs and started ranking them lower, limiting the Journal's viewership. Executives at the Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., argue that Google's policy is unfairly punishing them for trying to attract more digital subscribers. They want Google to treat their articles equally in search rankings, despite being behind a paywall. "Any site like ours automatically doesn't get the visibility in search that a free site would," Suzi Watford, the Journal's chief marketing officer, said in an interview. "You are definitely being discriminated against as a paid news site." The Journal's experience could have implications across the news industry, where publishers are relying more on convincing readers to pay for their articles because tech giants like Google and Facebook are vacuuming up the lion's share of online advertising. Striking a balance With Google, publishers try to strike a balance. While they may want to sign up more subscribers by not giving away free articles, they also don't want their content to drop in search results, which drives traffic to their sites and can boost advertising sales. For that reason, many outlets with subscription businesses -- like The New York Times and Financial Times -- let Google users read at least one free article so they still rank high in search results. Google says its "first click free" policy is good for both consumers and publishers. People want to get the news quickly and don't want to immediately encounter a paywall. Plus, if publishers let Google users sample articles for free, there's a better chance they'll end up subscribing, Google says. The tech giant likens its policy to stores allowing people to flip through newspapers and magazines before choosing which one to buy. "For the many publishers who already take advantage of this approach, it provides the ability to protect their business model and the opportunity to convert people who sample their content into paying customers," Google said in a statement. The Journal decided to stop letting people read articles free from Google after discovering nearly 1 million people each month were abusing its three-article limit. They would copy and paste Journal headlines into Google and read the articles for free, then clear their cookies to reset the meter and read more, Watford said. Free on Facebook The Journal now only lets Google users see a short snippet at the top of its articles, restricting the rest to its 2.2 million subscribers or people who arrive via social media. In the most recent quarter, the Journal's digital subscribers grew about 30% compared with the prior year, driven partly by barring Google users from reading for free. Google, meanwhile, displays a "subscription" label next to Journal articles in Google News search results, alerting users that they won't be getting a full article. The Journal's ad revenue wasn't affected by its recent drop in Google traffic because social media visits grew 34% in that time, keeping overall web traffic flat, Watford said. The Journal lets readers get some articles for free via social media like Twitter and Facebook, which the paper views as a marketing tool. Publishers have long complained about how their articles appear in search results. For years, many newspapers complained that online media companies published posts based on their reporting with a Google-friendly headline and appeared higher in search results. News Corp. has a tense history with Google. In 2009, Murdoch accused Google of stealing articles and threatened to pull his company's stories from its search results. News Corp. also competes with the tech giant in various ways. It's an investor in AppNexus, an advertising technology company that rivals Google's DoubleClick platform. News Corp. also owns Unruly, which competes with Google's YouTube in social video advertising. But the Journal isn't the only publisher skeptical of Google's policy. Jessica Lessin, founder of The Information, a technology publication, said sampling options like Google's "first click free" program "have not proven to be as beneficial as many publishers thought." Her publication, which charges $399 a year for an online subscription, doesn't let Google users read any articles for free because it's focused on a Silicon Valley audience that's more likely to find its journalism through social media than from a Google search, she said. Google and publishers often have different objectives, said Lessin, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. Google wants to capture attention so it can sell advertising. Many publishers want to convince readers to pay. "Tech companies are always going to do what's in the interest of their business," Lessin said. That's not always the same as what's in the interest of publishers, she said. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Media Online Publishing Search Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Careers On Campus Site by AREA 17
Apple Thinks You’ll Pay Double for Its Smart Home Speaker Apple is positioning HomePod as a premium music device, with a price tag to match. The rumors were true. Apple just announced its own smart home speaker. If the new tech battleground is machine learning and AI, there's just no way the company was going to let Siri concede the home speaker category to Google Assistant and Alexa, which power Google Home and the Amazon Echo, respectively. First, the brass tacks. It's called HomePod, which sounds a little more like the birthing chamber of alien space babies than a great new living room audio companion. It'll cost $349 when it goes on sale in December. That's almost twice what an Amazon Echo costs ($179) and even more expensive than the Google Home ($129). And you can get it in any color you want as long as it's either black or white. Apple is aiming the device at music lovers, and promises far better sound quality than those other smart speakers. There are seven tweeters that pump out directional audio and a big custom woofer that Apple says will remain distortion-free as you ramp up the volume. The HomePod uses a six microphone array to not only hear you better, but sense the acoustics of its room placement and intelligently shape audio to provide a bigger sound stage. You can even use two at once and they'll work together. Because why not spend $700 on a pair of smart speakers? Siri has gained a bunch of new music-oriented features based around natural language recognition rather than specific keywords. You can say "add this to my workout playlist" or "who's playing drums on this track?" Machine learning takes your own preferences into account to play songs that Siri thinks you'll like. The emphasis appears to be on music (how else to justify a steep price premium for better speakers?), but of course HomePod is a full-featured hub for Siri as a home assistant. You can ask it for news or weather, create reminders, set alarms and timers, get sports scores, and generally all the general knowledge answers you expect from Siri on your iPhone or iPad. We still have some unanswered questions, of course. The biggest of which is whether HomePod will support multiple users. Siri on your phone is personal, but a box you yell at from across the living room is going to be used by everyone in your house. Google just enabled its Home speaker to work with up to 6 accounts by automatically detecting voices. Apple made no mention of HomePod supporting multiple users... which means your music preferences might get totally skewed by your kids, or your spouse might set reminders that show up on your phone instead of hers.

Apple introduces HomePod: A premium speaker with Siri The device will compete with Google Home and Amazon Echo, but Apple is trying to distinguish it with sound quality and privacy features. Greg Sterling on June 5, 2017 at 4:26 pm More As anticipated, Apple introduced its Amazon Echo and Google Home competitor today at WWDC, its developer conference in San Jose. The retro-named HomePod has Siri built in, but Apple didn’t lead with that or immediately present the new device as a stand-alone virtual assistant. The company made its pitch by emphasizing the sound quality of the speaker and the overall music experience (Apple Music is integrated). Apple initially presented HomePod as a Sonos competitor rather than a rival for Google Home and Echo. The virtual assistant features were mentioned almost as an afterthought. The HomePod with Siri can do most or all of the things that Google Home and Amazon Echo do, although there was no discussion of a developer ecosystem (that’s coming, undoubtedly). We won’t know how well it performs versus the other devices until it’s released in December. At $349, it’s the most expensive of the three; Echo retails for $179 and Google Home for $129. Amazon’s new Echo Show, with a screen, is $229. Once again, Apple is not trying to compete on price but is presenting its device as the premium choice. A subtle but important — for some consumers — feature is the fact that Apple is doing more around privacy than its rivals. Unlike both Google Home and the Amazon Echo, HomePod won’t listen all the time or record what is being said in the room: With HomePod, only after “Hey Siri” is recognized locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier. In addition to HomePod with Siri, there were a number of Siri improvements and upgrades announced today: It will feature a more natural-sounding voice interface. There will be a new male voice for the US market. It will be able to have more conversational interaction, with follow-up answers. There’s a new, more visual UI. Siri will now provide more results for queries. It will translate from English into five other languages. It will make context-sensitive and proactive/predictive suggestions. Apple said that Siri is currently used at least monthly on 375 million devices, in 36 countries and in 21 languages. However, Apple has a long way to go to catch up to Amazon, and even Google, in the smart speaker market. It’s estimated that Amazon has an installed base of nearly 12 million Alexa devices. Google’s numbers are less certain but probably in the low millions. About The Author Greg Sterling Greg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.

Apple's HomePod speaker pumps up the volume on tech rivals Associated Press | 0 comments SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

CEO Tim Cook announced the device as the day’s “one last thing.” “We think we can do a lot,” Cook said, “to make the experience [of listening to music in your home] much better.” The speaker is 7 inches tall, covered in “acoustic” mesh, with a 4-inch woofer. Along the bottom: 6 microphones and a beam-forming tweeter. It runs $349, which is far more expensive than competing products. View photos The Apple Homepod. Photo: AppleMore Like Amazon’s (AMZN) $179 Echo, Apple’s HomePod is not just for music. It can tell you the weather, read you news and sports scores, and perform many other tasks, all beginning with the command, “Hey Siri.” Three years after Amazon launched the Echo and six months after Google (GOOG, GOOGL) launched its $109 Home, this is Apple’s first entry to the category. And like those products, the speaker is a gateway to other Apple products, and a showcase for Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. Amazon Echo is powered by Alexa, while Google Home is powered by Google Assistant. (Last month, Microsoft announced the Invoke, a smart speaker powered by its Cortana voice assistant, set to go on sale in the fall.) Of course, you could also count the Sonos, the Beats Pill, and the Jawbone Jambox as home speakers that will have to compete with Apple HomePod now. View photos Google Home (L) vs. Amazon EchoMore You might wonder why it took Apple this long to launch a home speaker. Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller answered that very question. He reasoned that there are great speakers already out there, but they aren’t “smart,” and there are smart speakers, but they don’t always deliver great quality. In addition to its own new speaker, Apple revealed that its new iOS 11 can control all the speakers in your home from your iPhone, including any Airplay-compatible third-party speakers. Announcing the Siri speaker was just one of many Siri-related upgrades that came out of this year’s WWDC. Apple opened the event by showing off new “Siri faces” for the Apple Watch Series 2 that use the voice assistant to provide quick information on the go. Later in the event, Apple ran through upgrades to Siri, including an updated voice (female and male), ability to translate from other languages, and syncing Siri’s learning about you across all your devices. So, which smart home speaker should you buy—Amazon’s, Google’s, or Apple’s?

Company Summary NSE BSE Bharti Airtel Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel is in talks with Google for deployment of WiFI hotspots for the US internet major’s station WiFi service in India, a move that can help India’s top telco improve broadband experience as it fights to retain, if not add, subscribers amid intense competition. “Airtel is having discussions with Google around Station WiFi…these are initial discussions,” a person familiar with the matter told ET. A second person said Airtel is getting into new partnerships around WiFi to overcome monetisation as well as ecosystem related challenges. Airtel recently inked a partnership with social networking giant Facebook for deployment of 20,000 WiFi hotspots. The telco is currently in the planning stage for this deployment. “Companies like Google and Facebook can help telcos overcome challenges related to software, as their existing software is not scalable. By partnering with telcos, companies like Google and Facebook are taking away some cost by providing software,” the second person said. The Google Station platform has WiFi network management capability, and focuses on monetisation to make the service self-sustainable. Bharti Airtel didn’t respond to ET queries, while a Google India spokesperson said the company is talking to all venue owners and service providers for Gstation as a full stack Wifi solution provider. Google India’s country head (connectivity) Gulzar Azad had previously told ET, “We are looking at more partnerships around Google Station platform. A specific initiative is partnerships with system integrators. Larsen & Toubro is one we are in discussions with. Interactions are also on with ISPs. Some will translate into partnerships.” With the Station platform, Google is extending its WiFi service beyond railway stations to places frequented by large numbers such as malls and transit stations, and in social hangout locations such as cafes and universities. It recently won its first city WiFi deal in collaboration with companies such as IBM, Larsen & Toubro and RailTel from Pune Smart City Development Corporation. “From Airtel’s perspective, the strategy will be more to help improve customer experience without spending extra on traditional mobile networks, and not necessarily a strategy around direct monetization,” Rohan Dhamija, partner and head for India and South Asia at Analysys Mason, said. He said these partnerships are an extension of Airtel’s WiFi offload strategy as these Wifi hotspots will help the telco offload traffic in peak congestion area.

We like this definition. New updates to the itslearning learning management system will make it even easier for K-12 teachers to assess and grade their students during the 2017-18 school year. Boston, MA (PRWEB) June 05, 2017 New updates to the itslearning learning management system (LMS) will make it even easier for K-12 teachers to assess and grade their students during the 2017-18 school year. Among the LMS’ enhancements is a streamlined grading workflow, a new capacity for annotating student submissions online and the ability to easily see students’ assignment status, to search and share assessment activities, and to deliver tests and see grades on any device. “Our goal is to provide the best integrated grading and assessment experience for teachers and students, alike,” said Arne Bergby, CEO of itslearning. “For students, we know the importance of staying connected to their results and outcomes of school work. So now we’ve made it a one-stop shop where they’ll be able to check their grades from any device they choose. For teachers, we were determined to make it easier to complete their assessment and grading tasks so they can spend more time teaching.” The updated grade book features enhanced data entry and it provides greater ease of use on mobile devices such as tablets. When an assignment or task deadline passes without a submittal from a student, that individual entry in the grade book will automatically become shaded red so teachers can see what’s overdue at a glance. itslearning will also allow teachers to use their browser to annotate student submissions in common file types such as MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint as well as Google Sheets, Google Docs and Google Slides. This new annotation capability will simplify the feedback process, allowing for detailed and personalized feedback. The LMS’ new assignment tool will be the fastest and easiest way to submit, view and grade student work. It will allow students to submit assignments via a cloud service such as Google Drive or OneDrive, which means that they will be able to submit an assignment, or even take a test, on any device of their choosing. The tool also will enable teachers to quickly and easily see which students have or have not completed assigned work. In addition, teachers will be able to search and share assignments, tests and third party assessments via the itslearning library. Educators can even search for assessments by standards. A new, shareable and easy-to-use test tool will allow students to take assessments on all devices and screen sizes. “Teachers can let students take a test on their phone in class and immediately see the results so they’ll know whether they need to spend some additional instruction time against the subject matter and when they can safely move on,” said Bergby. The added assessment and grading features are just the latest enhancements itslearning has announced. In April, the company introduced market-leading integrations to the world’s most popular cloud apps giving users the ability to work in Excel, Word and PowerPoint directly from within itslearning, without the need for a Microsoft email account or for any user information to be shared with Microsoft. In May, the LMS enhanced its mobile app, giving K-12 students and their teachers the full LMS experience even when they’re on the go. District administrators, teachers and students are now able to access course content, resources and tools on their Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Additionally, students can use the app to submit assignments and attach files. For more information about itslearning and its award-winning platform go to https://itslearning.com About itslearning With a passion for improving teaching and learning through technology, itslearning lives at the heart of education. In fact, the itslearning platform is the first LMS in the K-12 marketplace to offer educators content accessible from the cloud, including 1.7 million free and open resources, searchable, tagged with rich metadata, and ready to use, and more than 35 peer-reviewed courses. Established in 1999, itslearning is headquartered in Boston, MA and Bergen, Norway and serves seven million users worldwide.

But at least some of the interest in Apple's latest version of its Safari browser was based on what it doesn't do. In a nutshell, a new version of Apple's Safari for Mac's new High Sierra operating system won't display auto-playing videos on websites, something many web users hate. And it won't allow websites to track users as they move across the web either. These new features may put Apple on users' good side, since both auto-playing videos and user-tracking are seen as annoying and intrusive. But publishers and media companies aren't likely to greet these new additions with open arms, and neither are advertisers. Apple says new version of Safari will block autoplay videos. not ideal for video publishers.- Jack Marshall (@JackMarshall) June 5, 2017 Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi said the upcoming version of Safari will block auto-play videos and will feature what he called "intelligent tracking prevention," which will keep websites from tracking your browsing data. "Now your browser history is your own," he said. Apple's moves come on the heels of an announcement from Google that the next version of its Chrome web browser—which has about 60% of the market—will block certain ad types by default, including auto-playing video ads. In some cases, websites that have a lot of low-quality ads would have all their ads blocked, not just the ones that breach Google's rules. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Related UberUber’s Biggest Rival in India Says the Company Is ‘Despicable’ Uber Uber’s Biggest Rival in India Says the Company Is ‘Despicable’ In Google's case, the fact that the company is one of the world's largest advertising businesses and Chrome is the leading browser by market share makes some publishers and advertisers nervous. Some legal experts have even raised the possibility that it might breach anti-trust rules. Although the search giant points out that the definition of which ads are acceptable comes from an independent industry group called the Coalition for Better Ads, some believe that the default blocking of certain ads puts too much power in Google's hands. Apple doesn't have a huge digital advertising business the way Google does, and its browser is the third or fourth player in the market based on recent estimates. So it would be harder to make the case that Apple's choice to not show auto-playing videos is anti-competitive. That said, however, Apple has a large and powerful user base, and the fact that it is using that power to remove certain forms of advertising—and tools that advertisers and publishers use, such as user tracking—is bound to set off alarm bells in the industry. Apple announces that Safari browser will block autoplay video ads. nice for Internet users, sucks for media businesses.... #wwdc2017- Daniel Roberts (@readDanwrite) June 5, 2017 Although it is a small player in relative terms, Apple sparked much of the current outcry about ad-blocking software when it made iOS 9 compatible with third-party ad blockers in 2015. Ad-blocking in general, on both the desktop and mobile web, has been growing rapidly over the past couple of years, according to industry surveys. Users on mobile devices in particular are not happy with the time-consuming and intrusive ads that many sites rely on to make money. Publishers, meanwhile, argue that they have no choice but to use these annoying features, because Google and Facebook have taken over so much of the digital-advertising market. According to one industry analyst, the two companies combined have about 75% of the $70-billion U.S. digital advertising market, and between the two of them, they accounted for virtually all of the growth in the industry last year.

[Update: Fixed] It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 12:04pm PDTJun 5, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares53 Google Google Home News Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google has updated the thread to say all issues have been addressed. If you still have problems, try restarting.

Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. abc A comment with 13 upvotes ranks lower than the top comment which has only 4 upvotes. One can imagine how many butthurt Google fanboys must have downvoted this comment. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All of them. ericshmerick How's the sodium level of that snack? Salty? Salty. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Spencer I've been having the same issue. I'm considering switching it from my 5Ghz network to my 2.4Ghz just to see if that makes a difference... Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime. Curtis Bond So this is what worked for me. Every time I used the hot-phrase it would spit out the same error, but once my wife used the hot-phrase, it started working perfectly. After that neither of us had issues. I'm pretty sure it's a software problem that's related to voice recognition. Also, big ups to AP for posting this. If Google is going to be serious about consumer electronics, they've got to stay on top of nonsense like this. A widespread failure like this should be unacceptable, and frankly should have been fixed already. Kyle Kepner I have five Google homes and 3 of them are wonky right now. Resets did not help ericshmerick Resetting will do nothing. It's a problem with ~the cloud~ LondonLeedsFan Is this feature available in the UK? Bruce Wayne And we want to trust these people to drive our cars autonomously. LOL. YuCMi Wouldn't it just chill your spine to hear your car saying, "Hmmm, something went wrong," while on a busy expressway? Đức Thành If you ever consider writing a script for a horror movie, please know that I'd like to read it and direct its movie. Just saying. YaKillaCJ I would rather have Wayne Tech JD Seeing as how they had Real life RC-able atomic powered cars in 1966 and a fully automatic self driving voice controlled car by 1989 I approve. DJ JoJo I was able to get mine working by going into home app, clicking upper right devices button. Next to Google home pic was "ready for multi user" prompt. I clicked it and trained my voice and it's working with no problems now. I had already power cycled and rebooted but that didn't work until I clicked on prompt. Defenestratus it didn't work for me for literally 3 minutes. Then it worked again. abc To be fair, it's a beta product. Bugs can happen. :) SunnyStroker Yep, that's Google! Always half Baked, always in Beta. Daniel Including Android right? I think we can cut them some slack considering how many things they give us for free. JD Its not free You are the product #productception KSubedi Almost returned mine because of that because I thought mine was defective unit. drkarlp I had mine for 9 months....I think it happened once - I re booted and all was fine. I love Google Home ! ericshmerick Wow...a positive poster. Everything okay? Garrett Johnson Fun fact. Holding the Microphone off button for 15 will do a factory data reset. According to Google's help center page you can not do a FDR from the app. Only reboot. That being said it didn't fix it for me Lars Jeppesen No issues on my GHomes located in Denmark and Brazil. Maybe a US only thing? John "OK Google, add HomePod to my shopping list." "Umm, something went wrong." ericshmerick All 3 of mine have been instantly throwing an error when I say "Hey Google." Been going on for a few days. Maddening. Markg55 All fixed. That was quick. JD My echo is working just fine thx JD Must have something to do with the prep for their Canadian launch... #blamecanada Frawlz Mine is still bugging out.

[Deal Alert] Get a $75 credit when spending $750 or more on a Pixel with Google Store Financing Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 8:04am PDTJun 5, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 25 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Deals Google Pixel Pixel XL The Pixel is a great phone, but it's not sold by most carriers. Google make it a little easier to afford this device by making financing available. It's rare that Google discounts devices on the Google Store, but you can get $75 off a Pixel right now if you use financing. There are some caveats, but not as many as most carrier deals. The deal requires you to spend at least $750—the Pixel XL would certainly fulfill that, but a 128GB regular Pixel should work too. Hey, or you could just buy a few Pixels. Your call. Just sign up for Google Store Financing and keep your account in good standing. After two billing cycles, you'll get an account credit for $75. This deal also entitles you to the free Pixel case, which Google started a week or two ago. The Pixel is getting a bit old, and maybe you shouldn't hop on that train anymore. Still, this is a good deal. Source: Google Store Tags deals Google google store pixel pixel xl subscribe ...

I'll stick to the essentials Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Watch out, Spigen might sue you! Aaron With the LCD display, lack of waterproofing and ugly screen mounted selfie can, I'm really not seeing any essential for me. Rawhi Mohammad Good points.. to be honest, I'm looking forward to the uglycam, waterproofing yes, that would have been nice. LCD.. that might suck, I'm used to my AMOLED. But it won't hurt to try it out and see for myself. Aaron Hey I'm definitely not angry about another premium vendor on the market. And there's a lot to be excited about here. But about like the first gen Pixels, I was hoping for a little more. Rawhi Mohammad Definitely agree.. they could've justified it's price by tackling all these points. Wonder if anyone ever will BinaryTB Maybe if it was a Pixel C, who knows if Google will announce another tablet, so might as well get the only pure Android tablet currently available. T4rd New battery definitely revived my 6P. Went from this with early shutdowns at 10-30%: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e2cf19817b113fda177a0371891906cc98537e17585ef51f9862d7c355c8837.png To this with 4-5 hours SoT again and no early shutdowns: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d935df6962acf507febc9d3ee4bb9a7deb1c8c5b91fe814c91768238d96f1966.png Edit: Opps, replied to wrong comment, hah. But I see Edgar replied anyways below. Edgar Martin Hope it fixes mine also. Two more days until I get a new battery. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4c60dbd62abb2ed4ae54165974d0fe71c8b31a84df4ffa732379c98e1a7b3d6a.png T4rd Damn, that's pretty bad. So does it really only last like 1 hour of SoT then? lol Edgar Martin If that. Lol. It's on the charger most of the time. ☹️ Jay That's really bad. 😮 Tom Z Here's how bad mine has gotten. I just purchased a Nexus 5x from Newegg to hold me over until the Pixel 2 arrives. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ebfe8d90329e8d0be031b0030b1000ba8c797240fb1238e0ce206802427b2b5a.png T4rd Wow.. you know Google is replacing 6Ps out of warranty because of this, right? Or you could have just got that $10 6P battery I posted below and had a local repair place put it in for you for much less than that 5X costs. Jason Pagliaro Mine went into the reboot loop of death this weekend, sadly. Battery was getting bad but no early shutdowns, at least. TheDrunkenClam Is it easy to do this replacement? Plombir It's not easy for sure plus you need tools as well. I will just get a battery and take my phone to a reputable shop to get it installed. asianrage Most likely, get a replacement back and glass and such. The chance of damaging that visor is very high. T4rd It's not hard IMO, but I've had a bit of experience repairing phones, tablets, and other electronics too and it does require some basic phone repair tools; heat gun/blow dryer, plastic wedges/guitar picks, super thin metal pry tool or x-acto knife, and a small screw driver. Most phone parts come with most of these tools (my battery from eBay did), but I've acquired many from past repairs I've done. I replace the battery in my previous One M8 too, which was considerably harder than this 6P since you had to completely disassemble the phone sans the display to get to it. Fortunately on the 6P, once you get the housing off, the battery is easy to get to and replace from there. The hardest part on this phone is removing the bottom plastic panel and top glass without damaging anything (much). So it's important to have a super thin knife or tool to pry these pieces out.. I had to make due with a box cutter blade and got it off with minimal damage to the housing. Anfronie I'm thinking of doing this soon. Where can I get an reputable OEM battery that is not a knockoff? I don't want to do all that work if the replacement battery is crap. Thanks for any info! T4rd I got this one: http://www.ebay.com/itm/252482757101?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT Looked EXACTLY like the original OEM battery and a few others in this Reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/66tzgh/if_youre_on_the_fence_about_replacing_your/#bottom-comments) bought that one as well with the same results as I have had. You can see pics of it there too next to the original battery. Anfronie Thanks a ton for the info! :D John Doe Google sent me a 15% discount "just for you" off of the Pixel XL. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6e48720cee18cef32533cfd87278a84f7cb2d33eb3bdfa5289ad659e1c1908.png Good_Ole_Pinocchio You didn't use it did you? John Doe No of course not LoL Edgar Martin Hopefully getting the battery replaced in my Nexus 6P this Wednesday will allow me to hold off until the next Pixel is release... If not then Pixel XL it is. T4rd It's annoying that Google refuses to discount their Pixel devices. The Pixel C is now a major rip-off at $600 and almost 2 years old. Makes you wonder if or how much they'll discount the current Pixel phones when the new ones come out. I'm guess they'll take a generous $100 off their current prices, lol. Good_Ole_Pinocchio They won't... they'll just replace them with the New Pixel. T4rd Probably.. which would be for the best considering they still can't even keep stock of them now, let alone when they're superseded. Jason Pagliaro And use the remaining inventory for warranty replacements. Cael What inventory? Jason Pagliaro Everything except the 5" black seem to be in stock unless I'm missing something. Chris G Hope they bring the financing option to Canada this year with the pixel 2. exzacklyright Pixel 2 tho... Might as well wait JG Yeah... Too bad they probably won't let us open a financing account now and start paying ahead for the Pixel 2... Get the $75 credit in August... Have half (or a fourth, depending if you do 1 or 2yrs) of the Pixel 2 paid off by the time it's released... Would result in less of a sting to the check book, especially Taimen turns out to be a tablet, about time to replace my Nexus 9... me me oooh I so need to spend $750. Cowboydroid Sad, Google. Just sad. James Briano Boss to Johnson: "I want you to handle all the Pixel sales. ALL the Pixel sales!" Johnson to his broker: "Put all my money in Samsung. ALL my money." Badouken Just need my 6P to last til end of October for the Pixel 2 to release! atc-tech Lol... "DEAL!" yeah.... Bruce Wayne Lol. $750 on a Pixel. abc $750 for a year old phone that was overpriced to start with. Ridiculous. Testraindrop Deal Alert? Spending 750$ or more for a Pixel? Now? Why? There are so many alternatives. D.Smithee lol--$750 or more on a Pixel. Never gonna happen. WAY overpriced. Ray $1400+ here in a Australia for a 128gb XL. Absolute fraud I tell you.

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 140 Share on Facebook 80 Share on Twitter Total Shares248 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. makapav Actually - the invitation feature to my wife/kids works great - because it results in an actionable item and a response. I can push back to my wife as 'tentative' or decline and still have it on my calendar and have acted on it as opposed to stuff just appearing on my calendar without notice. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both. Merlyn Nak-nak Clemente Ich bin der Mann der euch das Angstspürren spüren läst.meine Frau ist mir scheiss egal.meine kinder sind mir wischtiger erptastic k. Kettir Someone pls translate this properly. Google translate says his kids are wiping him and his wife is the s**t??? Maybe he feels your pain? IDK keithzg Weird how you somehow managed to avoid capitalizing words in the positions where normally both in English and auf Deutsch you would have capitalized them. Closely relatedly, the lack of spaces postpending your sentences is an odd choice. Artem Russakovskii Went live for me today. Finally no more inviting my wife to all the stuff we do together. Peter I'm too lazy to check, but i assume this isn't available to G Suite accounts? Peter To answer my own question, yeah GSuite not supported. keithzg Yeah, but you have Hangouts Chat whereas we all know that Hangouts is gonna eventually stop working for the rest of us, so it all balances out ;) Deborahthampton Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !di74c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Grey I really hope we all get Hangouts Chat. It's not live for anyone yet, but I really hope it replaces regular Hangouts. It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. keithzg See, that would make a lot of sense, which is why knowing Google's messaging strategy we can be assured it will not happen. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only I could use it with G Suite. Calvin Mccoy I work from comfort of my home, via doing simplistic activities that only normally requires from you a Laptop or computer and web connection and Now I am pleased than ever before...

C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me. (Grumble Grumble) Tv One feature I'd like to see with this is the ability to disable individual family members on specific Google products. For example, we have the grandparents as part of our family group. The "Family Group" sharing is useful for Play Music and Photos, but they don't need to be part of shared Keep and Calendar items. Jeffrey Linton As a few others pointed out a new shared calendar that I labeled "Family" I added years ago was my answer. Any events that the whole family needs to be aware of goes there, I also added that calendar to extended family that wants to know when the kids events are to come see them. With the "Family Group" calendar I wouldn't be able to do that unless I also added them to the family group, which I didn't want to do. Auburngirl Great addition but you can't share the ical to Outlook, so I can't see it with my work calendar. That is a big problem. Patel Nisha I had this 2 weeks ago and kept getting failed email emails doing with the family. I hope they fixed whatever problem that was.

Apple is stuffing its beloved Siri into an Internet-connected speaker in what is the digital giant's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker was  unveiled at a conference for software programmers on Monday, and will go head-to-head-to-head with Amazon and Google's popular digital home assistants. NEW IMAC PRO APPLE'S MOST POWERFUL EVER But of course Apple says its siri-based system tops them all because it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Not surprisingly, there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. SIRI SOUNDS LIKE A DUDE But it all comes for a fairly hefty price. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. So that speaker better sounds pretty nice. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. WHAT IS APPLE WATCH'S FUTURE?

Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo People June 05, 2017 8:50 PM Apple's HomePod speaker pumps up the volume on tech rivals By MICHAEL LIEDTKE and BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writers LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SAN JOSE, Calif. Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Apple's John Ternus speaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif., Monday, June 5, 2017. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (8) San Jose, California • Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple's HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple's first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. » Next page...

Source: Shutterstock The new feature to Google Chrome will allow it to block ads that are obtrusive. This will include ones that auto-play videos with sound, as well as pop-up ads and others. Google won’t be the sole company that determines if an ad isn’t appropriate. The Coalition for Better Ads , which Google is a member of, will handle that. This group also includes Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), The Washington Post and others. The decision to block some ads for Google Chrome users is the company’s own way of cleaning up the internet. It also has a tool available for websites and ad providers to alert them if their ads will be blocked. Google doesn’t believe that the new feature should be considered an ad blocker. Instead it claims that it is an ad filter. The goal of the project is to create a system that will hopefully keep users from relaying heavily on normal ad blockers, reports The Verge. “In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018,” Sridhar Ramaswamy, Senior Vice President of Ads & Commerce at Google, said in a blog post. Google will also be introducing a way for users to donate money to websites that they visit. However, it is unlikely that this feature will see much use.

SAN JOSE, California— Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple’s HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple’s first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR: New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features: New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Mac gets an upgrade: Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Watch the watch: Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Filed in: National & World, News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Here's what we know about the release date, price, and specs. by Dominic Preston | 05 Jun 17 Contents > When is the HomePod release date? > How much does it cost? > What does it look like? > What features does it have? Apple is finally getting into the smart home speaker business with the HomePod, its rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have driven popularity for their Siri alternatives. Much like its rivals, the Siri-enabled speaker will be able to respond to voice commands and play music, set alarms, control smart devices, and search for information online. What makes the HomePod stand out is that Apple claims it will blow the competition away on sound quality, so you don't have to sacrifice your speaker just to make it smart. Here's everything we know about the Apple HomePod, including features, release date and expected UK price. When is the HomePod release date? After months of speculation, Apple officially announced the HomePod at its WWDC 2017 developer conference, and took the opportunity to announce the release window: December 2017. The company didn't confirm a specific date for the launch, but did announce that it would initially be available in the US, UK, and Australia, with more markets to follow in 2018. How much does it cost? The HomePod will cost $349 in the US when it launches in December, though Apple hasn't yet confirmed UK pricing - we'd expect it to be pretty close to £349 though. That's markedly more expensive than the nearest rivals. The Amazon Echo is priced at £149.99/$179.99, with the cheaper Echo Dot available for £49.99/$49.99, while Google Home is £129/$129. What does it look like? Echoing speculation in the weeks running up to its announcement - and in line with the designs chosen by rivals Amazon and Google - Apple has opted for a cylindrical design for the HomePod. Available in either White or Space Grey, the HomePod stands just under 7 inches tall, and is covered almost head to toe in a "seamless 3D mesh fabric," just leaving space at the top for the Siri interface - a small screen that lights up with a Siri waveform when she's assisting you with something. Contrary to some rumours, there's no obvious touch screen - the top section includes touch controls for Siri, but there's certainly no substantial screen similar to Amazon's Echo Show. What features does it have? During the WWDC 2017 announcement, Apple made a great deal of the HomePod's musical functionality, going so far as to claim that the smart speaker will "reinvent home music." To start with, that comes from the speaker itself. It features a 4in, Apple-designed upward-facing woofer paired with an array of seven beam-forming tweeters, each with its own amplifier. During the announcement, Apple compared the HomePod to the Sonos range of wireless speakers, suggesting that Apple is confident the HomePod is of a similar audio quality. The speaker itself is backed by spatial awareness technology, powered by an A8 chip, which apparently means the HomePod can analyse the room its in and optimise the audio output so that it sounds the best it can for whatever room its in. It apparently works even better if you have two (or more?) HomePods in the same room, as they'll work together to create the best sound possible. Of course, all of that just makes for a good speaker - what makes the HomePod special is that its a smart, Siri-powered speaker. That means it can connect to Apple Music and all of your other Apple services to serve as a home assistant. There are six microphones built into the top ring of the device so that it can pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, even over music, and a Siri waveform will appear on the top section (which doubles as touch controls) when she's responding to one of your queries. When it comes to music, that means it can do things like play a certain song, album, artist, or genre on command; let you know things like when a song was recorded or who the drummer was; and even just 'play more like this'. Beyond that, the smart functionality is similar to what you're already used to from Siri. The HomePod can be used to set reminder, answer questions, or check the weather. It can also integrate to all your HomeKit-compatible appliances to become the hub of your smart home. Apple also made a point of emphasising its approach to privacy and security. It claims that the HomePod will only send any information to Apple's servers after 'Hey Siri' is recognised, and that even then it will be "encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier."

Like devices by Amazon and Google, Apple's HomePod speaker can respond to questions and control smart home gadgets such as lights. Analysts say Apple has been slow to improve its Siri virtual assistant and launch a smart speaker, after Amazon launched its Echo in 2014. The company has pitched HomePod first and foremost as a music player. Dave Lee's review: Superb sound, but how smart? "Apple is being very clever by launching its Siri speaker as a music speaker that's smart, because Siri isn't great," said Tom Warren from the technology news site The Verge. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionWatch: Apple also showed off its iPad Pro multi-tasking feature "Interesting that home assistant was the last feature they talked about. Focusing on music is smart, main use case for smart speakers," said Ben Bajarin, of the Creative Strategies consultancy. The announcement was made at the tech giant's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California. "It's a logical step for Apple, to ensure that they don't miss the opportunity to get a smart device right in the centre of people's homes," said Ben Wood, an industry analyst at CCS Insight. "There has been a huge amount of hype around Amazon Echo and Google Home, but we are really at the start of this technology. "This does a great job of extending the tentacles of Apple services." Analysis - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, at WWDC At more than double the cost of Amazon's Echo, the HomePod is a typical Apple move. The company is once again banking on its reputation as a creator of intuitive, luxury products that justify a hefty price tag. What's interesting about Apple's approach here is that the company has positioned HomePod as a music device first and foremost, a big contrast to the approach of Google which touted its Home speaker as a day-to-day assistant for many aspects of your life. So - a cynic might say Apple has just launched the world's most-hyped bluetooth speaker - not much imagination there. But let's face it, before AI and machine learning really matures, most home assistant devices are essentially voice-controlled speakers, and so Apple dedicating its effort into making it sound great is probably a smart move. Then again, you might wonder if its "smart" capabilities are being downplayed due to Siri just not being as advanced as its competitors. Mixed reality Tools that let app designers add virtual objects to a real-world view from the phone's camera, in real time, were also revealed. The mobile game Pokemon Go is a well-known example of mixed-reality technology in action. Image copyright APple Image caption ARkit will let people place virtual objects over a real-world view Apple said the new ARkit would make use of the dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, making the integration of virtual objects and the real world more realistic. "By truly enabling all modern iPhones to become augmented reality platforms, Apple will have the largest potential reach for AR development day one," said Mr Bajarin. However, he questioned the practicality of augmented reality on a smartphone. "The benefit to a headset or glasses in these demos is not having to hold the device up thus arms getting tired," he said. Safety in the car Apple also announced the next version of its mobile operating system - iOS 11 - which will include a new setting for people who use their iPhone in the car. In January, the company was sued by a US couple whose daughter was killed by a driver allegedly using FaceTime on his iPhone. The new driving mode silences notifications, turns the phone's display off, and can automatically reply to messages to warn friends that you are driving.

Apple also announced: a deal bringing the Amazon Prime Video streaming service to the Apple TV set-top box an update to its Safari web browser, which will now stop websites from tracking visitors and stop videos playing automatically speed upgrades to its iMac and Macbook range of computers, plus a new iMac Pro which the company says is the most powerful Mac ever made Related Topics Apple Apps Share this story About sharing Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn More on this story Apple's HomePod: Superb sound, but how smart? 6 June 2017 Video Amazon Echo speakers set to launch in UK and Germany 14 September 2016 Google Home to be launched in UK in April 28 March 2017 Top Stories Comey testifies on Trump and Russia The ex-FBI chief testifies to the Senate on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. 8 June 2017 Video shows police shooting London attackers 8 June 2017 Election day: Latest updates 6 June 2017 Features Four days behind the Taliban front line The 81-year-old woman inspiring a nation to recycle Can you be taught to be more charismatic?

The iPhone giant unveiled a device called the HomePod, a next generation voice-controlled music speaker that will be its first major new product category since it unveiled the Apple Watch in 2014. The HomePod marks a fightback against Amazon’s Echo, the voice-controlled Wi-Fi speaker that has been a surprise hit and put rivals such as Apple and Google on the back foot. Critics have accused Apple of being behind the curve on smart speakers, which are powered by artificial intelligence systems, leading to fears that it could miss out on the generation of gadgets that could follow the smartphone. Apple sought to position the HomePod as an extension of its musical heritage, with the device’s name a play on the original iPod music player. It features a high-definition speaker and runs the Apple Music streaming service, features the company hopes will give it an edge against the Echo and Google’s rival Home device. The HomePod speaker can adapt its sound based on the size and shape of a room, Apple said Credit: AP The speaker is powered by Apple’s virtual assistant software, Siri. As well as playing music, it can respond to spoken commands to send text messages, check the news or control smart home devices. The HomePod, which will be released in December and cost $349 (£270), was unveiled at Apple’s annual developer conference in San Jose, where the company also unveiled a spate of new software features and gadget upgrades. Updates to the iPhone’s operating system included a money transfer service that allows users to send cash to one another, the latest in Apple’s move into financial services after the launch of Apple Pay.  Apple created additional features in iOS 11 designed for the iPad Credit: Apple The company overhauled the App Store and its Apple Music streaming service and improved its Siri assistant with features such as language translation. Apple updated its range of iMac computers with a power boost that gives them virtual reality capabilities, as well as refreshing its line of MacBook laptops with faster processors. It also unveiled a new version of the iPad Pro, its high-powered tablet, with a slimmer design and a 10.5-inch screen, a third size option in addition to the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch versions already on the market. Apple is promoting the iPad Pro as a potential laptop replacement as it seeks to reverse falling sales of the tablet. Last night, it also updated the iPad iOS operating system with computer-grade features such as a PC-style file system. Apple chief executive Tim Cook on stage at WWDC Credit: Reuters A new version of the Apple Watch software will centre on the wearable device’s exercise capabilities and artificial intelligence, and updates to the Mac computer software included changes to its Safari web browser that limited how advertisers could track users across websites.  Apple, which boasts a market value of $815bn, is looking for new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, which provides most of its revenue, stall. It has recorded falling sales of its flagship handset for four straight quarters, and last year it posted its first decline in annual profits for 15 years. Sales of the iPad tablet have fallen consistently since 2013, and while the Apple Watch, has easily outsold competitors, it has not proved a hit on the scale of the iPhone or iPad. Executives have talked up the strength of its software and services business, which includes app sales, Apple Music and Apple Pay, and aims to double revenues to around $50bn a year by 2021. Apple shares fell 1pc.

Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected s... SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches - but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected s... SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year.

Apple unveils new voice assistant voice Published June 05, 2017 Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Email Print  (Reuters) Siri's voice is changing. Apple's famously female digital voice assistant will soon come with a male option, as Apple readies its own Siri-powered virtual butler to go head-to-head-to-head with Amazon's Echo and Google Home. But Siri isn't just being spruced up for the big new product launch. It will also be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple says it wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It says it will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Not creepy at all! THE FUTURE OF THE APPLE WATCH REVEALED! Apple didn't discuss the privacy implications, though typically, the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the Internet. That's a contrast to Google's approach. Apple's approach protects privacy, but might make the service less useful when switching devices. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud.

SAN JOSE: Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart'' home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple's HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple's first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality ``experiences.'' But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency'' format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention,'' meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. READ MORE ON » wwdc 2017Tim CookHomePod Speakerapple wwdc 2017Apple Comments Add Your Comments NEXT STORY Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You Get a Quote Browse CompaniesABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|123456789 Browse Mutual FundsABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ The Economic Times Live Market News Portfolio Mobile Live TV Newsletter Commodities Speed QnA Blogs Alerts RSS Other Times Group news sitesTimes of India|इकनॉमिक टाइम्स ઈકોનોમિક ટાઈમ્સ|Mumbai Mirror Times Now|Indiatimes नवभारत टाइम्स|महाराष्ट्र टाइम्स ವಿಜಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ|Lifehacker Gizmodo|Eisamay|IGN India NavGujarat Samay Living and entertainmentTimescity|iDiva|Zoom| Luxpresso|Gaana|Happytrips| Cricbuzz|Get Smartapp Networkingitimes|MensXP.com Hot on the WebICC Champions Trophy Live Score|Narendra Modi in Russia Top 10 mutual funds|RERA Xiaomi Redmi 4 Review|BSE Sensex Gold rate today Servicesads2book|Gadgetsnow|Free Business Listings Simplymarry|Astrospeak|Timesjobs|Magicbricks|Zigwheels|Timesdeal| dineout|Filmipop|Remit2india|Gaana|Greetzap|Techradar|Alivear| Google Play | Manage Notifications About us/Advertise with us/Terms of Use & Grievance Redressal/Privacy Policy/Feedback/Sitemap/Code of Ethics//Disclaimer Copyright © 2017 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, California (AP) — Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities.

It will not block the ads themselves, though. Sizing up the iPad Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week.

By Joshua Benton @jbenton June 5, 2017, 3:33 p.m. June 5, 2017, 3:33 p.m. Apple went the first five full months of 2017 without a public event to announce new products, so there was a backup of things to talk about at today’s overstuffed WWDC keynote. As usual, a few of the announcements had impacts on the publishing business; here are the highlights. HomePod: Apple led its presentation (and picked the name) of the HomePod with music in mind — putting it in a historical line with iTunes and iPods rather than the Amazon Echo. (Its first stated requirement was to “rock the house.”) In the same way the Apple Watch sells fitness as the hook to get a computer strapped on your wrist, HomePod sells music to get a microphone in your home — and for many people, music will be all it gets used for. But it also features the same sort of voice interaction patterns we’ve become familiar with with the Echo and Google Home. That includes some news elements; check out this slide of things you can say to your HomePod — asking for sports results, tuning into NPR, playing podcasts, and “tell me the latest news” are all options: There was no particular announcement in the keynote about Siri expanding to new classes of apps — though that could easily be something that is announced to developers later in the week or in developer docs just posted. So it’s unclear how open access to these queries will be. (“Hey Siri, ask The New York Times what’s going on in Syria.” “Hey Siri, ask Vox to explain healthcare reform in six minutes.”) But either now or at some point soon, publishers will likely have to decide whether Siri and the HomePod are worth developing for. (Update: The new SiriKit docs say only list-making and note-taking — “Hey Siri, add milk to my shopping list in Things” — are newly supported, so integration with news apps still seems to be theoretical.) Before investing in building for a platform, publishers like to have an idea how large the addressable market will be. Amazon, the clear leader, doesn’t release sales numbers for its devices (just like the Bezos-owned Washington Post doesn’t tell anyone how many digital subscribers it has, grumble grumble). eMarketer estimates Amazon has 70 percent of the U.S. market, and Morgan Stanley estimated 11 million units sold back in December, pre-holiday rush, the vast majority of them in the United States. Google Home is at a fraction of that. Amazon has made building Alexa skills quite easy, and its lower price point will likely keep it unthreatened as the market leader (the HomePod will go for $349 when it launches in December). But by putting the HomePod on the Siri platform, developing for it will likely also be able to take advantage of the huge installed base of iPhone and iPad customers. It’s worth watching what sort of access Apple allows developers; if it’s decent, it’s probably worth the time of an engineer or two at most or the largest publishers. Safari: The new Safari features a couple features of interest to publishers. First, it blocks autoplay videos; Craig Federighi said that Apple will learn over time what sites “shouldn’t” have autoplay — presumably excluding video sites like YouTube. Perhaps more importantly (at least for the adtech world), Safari will do “intelligent tracking prevention,” which seems to be selective blockage of cross-site cookies, the “feature” that lets something you looked at in an online store follow you around the web for days. (Both of these announcements were explicitly made for Macs, but it’s hard to imagine they won’t move to iPhones and iPads at some point.) Google is heading in a similar direction with Chrome, deciding what ads can and can’t be shown in-browser. Obviously, Google (which makes 90 percent of its revenue from advertising) and Apple (which makes almost none of its) have different incentives influencing their actions — but in both cases, the tech giants who control the leading browsers are using their power to clean up an advertising experience that publishers, adtech, and advertisers haven’t been able to. That raises legitimate antitrust concerns — but it also appears to be a fait accompli at this point. Some news execs are going to see big drops in the monthly play counts, but that’s probably for the best. iOS 11: In the long run, Apple’s interested in more information workers moving from MacBooks to iPads, but the phone-born iOS hasn’t always worked too well for more significant use. (Try researching a topic across multiple websites and then writing a link-heavy blog post about them on an iPad. Can you do it? Sure. Would you want to? Probably not.) So iOS 11, announced today and coming out this fall, includes a few updates that’ll be welcomed by, say, reporters in the field. A new multitasking view, based on a rebuilt Dock, looks much more flexible. A better on-screen keyboard should make typing numbers and punctuation easier. A new Files app exposes the file system to users in a way Steve Jobs famously resisted, but which might save you a few hundred “Open In…” dialogues. (This may or may not be linked to Apple’s successful launch of a new file system, which reached macOS today. And the interface can include third-party apps like Dropbox.) Text, images, and other bits of content can now be drag-and-dropped between apps. There’s 3D Touch tab switching in Safari. It’s a package of updates that should make word-based, multi-app work significantly easier. One other note: Apple is dropping support for 32-bit apps on iOS. It’s unlikely your publisher’s app is 32-bit unless it’s sat ignored for multiple years — actually maybe it’s not that unlikely? you probably have some weird print replica thing from 2012 still in there — but if it is, it’ll stop working this fall. Apple News: The lil’ distributed-content platform that could, Apple News has been a surprise hit with publishers and audiences alike, with outlets reporting big audiences, especially from push notifications. No big updates made the keynote threshold, but there was an interesting mention in a section about iOS. Siri — which seems to be getting a rebranding from a voice interface to a Google Assistant-style pan-device intelligence system — can now detect what you’re looking at in Safari and suggest news articles about them. The example given was someone searching for travel information about Reykjavík in Safari and then being prompted with Iceland-related news in Apple News. Some evil genius will figure out the right way to take advantage of this and unleash a new dark science of…Safari-engine optimization? A couple brief mentions on a slide seem to indicate Apple News videos will now appear in the Today view (which I imagine also means a more prominent treatment for video in the Apple News app) and a new Spotlight tab in the app. Update: According to promotional materials posted after the keynote ended: News becomes even more personal, showing top stories that are more relevant to you. Siri learns what’s important to you and suggests stories you might like. And our editors choose a different topic every day for you to explore in a new tab called Spotlight. They also craft a daily selection of the best videos for you to see in Today View. Plus this image of the Spotlight tab — this is part of what new editor-in-chief Lauren Kern will be working on, presumably: Note that the current Apple News tab bar goes For You / Favorites / Explore / Search / Saved, so there’s a little bit of swapping going on here. Miscellaneous: WWDC is about software first and foremost, but there were a few hardware updates. The 9.7″ iPad Pro grew to 10.5″, with smaller bezels; the larger size means keys on the on-screen and Smart Keyboards will be full-sized. MacBooks and iMacs were all updated with faster processors; the iMac also got boosted graphics capacity that should make it more useful for high-end video and VR production, an area where Apple has lagged. The company also announced an upcoming iMac Pro, due in December, which will be even more useful. Over on the Apple Watch, Apple News is now a native watch app, meaning push notifications can be viewed in a more native and visual environment on the watch. They’ll show up in a new Siri-powered watch face. Still probably only useful to publishers as a prompt to pick up your phone, though. The iPhone’s camera app now allows a sort of fake long-exposure filter, which at least a few tripod-free photographers will find tempting. Apple announced new machine learning and augmented reality tools for developers, which sounded impressive and could be of longer-term use to a few publishers. Finally, despite my hopes, there’s were no desktop Apple News or Podcasts apps announced — a space I’m a little surprised Apple hasn’t moved into yet. (Though the iOS Podcasts app has apparently gotten a redesign — potentially key given that’s by far the most popular places for podcasts to be consumed. And, though we don’t know much about it, a WWDC on Podcasts later this week promises that “iOS 11 upgrades the Apple Podcasts app to support new feed structures for serialized shows” — interesting!)

Photo Credit: AP / Marcio Jose Sanchez advertisement | advertise on newsday SAN JOSE, Calif. - Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device with features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house.

It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. TechnologyLatest from Apple's WWDC17 conference The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. advertisement | advertise on newsday KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. TechnologyCheck out Apple's just-announced tech products Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. Business22 fun facts about Apple The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. advertisement | advertise on newsday MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. TechnologyiPhone through the years SIZING UP THE IPAD advertisement | advertise on newsday Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Get the Biz Briefing newsletter! The latest LI business news in your inbox daily.

clock menu more-arrow The 8 biggest announcements from Apple WWDC 2017 by Natt Garun@nattgarun Jun 5, 2017, 3:52pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Apple’s WWDC 2017 keynote just wrapped, where key executives Craig Federighi, Phil Schiller, and, of course, Tim Cook, took the stage to announce updates headed to iPhones, MacBooks, Apple TV, and more. The rumors for this year’s WWDC came in the final hours leading up to the event, with hints of new hardware and, of course, software news for developers to help prep the release of consumer updates in the fall. We were also anticipating the company to finally take Siri up against the likes of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant on the hardware and smart home front — and it looks like it arrived in the form of the Apple HomePod. Here are the highlights from today’s keynote. Apple announces HomePod speaker to take on Amazon Echo and Sonos So let’s get the Siri speaker rumors out of the way: it turns out Apple wasn’t quite aiming its smart speaker to go against just Amazon Echo and Google Home, but also the Sonos home entertainment speakers. Called the HomePod, it uses spacial awareness to tune and better fill the room with sound based on the space it’s in. It also has a “Musicologist” feature that works with Apple Music to stream the music you ask the speaker’s built-in Siri to play. You can even ask more complex, music-related questions like “Who’s the drummer in this song?” or “What album came out on this day 20 years ago?” Apple priced the HomePod at $349 The HomePod will be available in two colors — black or white — and will integrate Siri in an Amazon Echo / Google Home-like use case. You can ask it to control smart home devices and check the day’s weather and news briefings. Apple priced the HomePod at $349, with plans to ship it in December first to customers in the US, UK, and Australia. It will enter more international markets next year. Check out our hands-on with the HomePod for a first look. iMac Pro introduced, alongside updated desktop specs Apple’s introducing updated iMac desktops with improved Retina displays, graphics boosts, Kaby Lake processors, and USB-C. They will also support graphics for VR content creation. During the keynote, Apple demoed this by showing off a VR game featuring Darth Vader, a lightsaber, and TIE fighter. There’s a new iMac Pro as well, with a 5K display with improved cooling capacity, and 8-core Xeon processor (upgradeable up to 18-core,) up to 4TB of SSD, up to 128GB of ECC memory, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and built-in 10GB Ethernet. Apple The new iMac starts at $1,099 for the 21.5-inch model, and $1,299 for the 4K model. MacBooks will get upgraded, too; the MacBook Pro starting at $1,299, which includes the updated Kaby Lake processor. The iMac Pro starts at $4,999, and ships in December. iOS 11 comes with improved Siri, automatic Do Not Disturb driving mode, iMessage features The new version of iOS software has some pretty social updates, such as an update to Siri that has improved speech, the ability to help translate sentences into different languages, and on-device learnings that suggest actions based on what you do on your iPhone or iPad. iMessages now live in the iCloud, with synchronized conversations that you can delete from any device you own that are under the same account. You can also pay and receive payments from contacts through iMessage — so no more Venmo or Square Cash if you don’t want to download extra apps. Siri now has improved speech Photo capture is also improved, with better low-light performance, and the ability to edit Live Photos so you can change the key still image or trim the video. There’s a new control center as well, which relies a lot on 3D Touch and condenses most controls on the lower half of the screen without looking cluttered. There’s also a new safety feature that recognizes when a user is driving and automatically turns on Do Not Disturb to prevent distractions. When you’re available to be more social, you can now head to Apple Music to see what your friends are listening to and check out shared playlists. Lastly, the App Store has been redesigned for better discovery and a How To section for tips on how to use various popular apps. Apple’s also bringing back the “App of the Day” section to promote users to open the App Store more frequently. iOS 11 for iPad brings Windows-esque multitasking abilities On the iPad, iOS 11 improves multitasking that lets users pull up an app from the dock and drag it onto the screen to split the screen. Similar to what you can do on a MacBook, you can use touch to hold and drag folders, files, or photos and drop them in a different app such as Mail or iMessage. Handwritten text from an Apple Pencil will also be searchable from the Notes app. Apple claims it uses “deep learning” to recognize penmanship. Apple also talked briefly about the Files app that leaked a few hours before the keynote kicked off, which is just a management system that you can use to sort files by size and date, similar to how you’d go through your files on a desktop or laptop. Apple lets developers make more immersive apps with ARKit Just as Lauren Goode predicted, Apple introduced a new ARKit to let developers build augmented reality apps for the iPhone. The kit can help find planes, track motion, and estimate scale and ambient lighting. Popular apps like Pokémon Go will also use ARKit for improved real-time renders. Rather than requiring external hardware like Microsoft’s HoloLens, Apple seems to be betting on ARKit to provide impressive quality imaging through a device most people already own. We’ll know more on how the quality actually compares when we get to try it out ourselves. 10.5-inch iPad Pro introduced The iPad Pro will now be available in three different sizes, with a new 10.5-inch model introduced today. There’s a 12-megapixel camera, just like the iPhone 7, with a 7MP selfie cam. It supports USB 3.0 and has 10 hours of battery life. There’s a new feature called ProMotion which reduces the Apple Pencil’s latency to 20 milliseconds. It can automatically adjust the refresh rate based on what you’re watching (fast-moving video versus still image). ProMotion also doubles the refresh rate to up to 120Hz. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be available starting with a 64GB configuration at $649; it’s available to order now and shipping next week. The new macOS is named High Sierra. Yep. The upcoming version of macOS will be called High Sierra, and it comes with updates to Safari that help block site trackers and autoplaying videos. Apple’s also added new photo-editing tools like curves (helpful for those who don’t have Adobe Photoshop), and it has better filtering tools to sort images by keywords or faces. An updated file management system will be a part of the update as well, which speeds up directory cloning with native encryption. On the graphics end, there’s a second version of Metal, support for VR, and a Metal 2 developer kit that you can order with an AMD GPU to tune apps for external graphics. watchOS 4 brings new Siri watchface, fitness coaching, and a new app-browsing UI An update for the Apple Watch is coming which introduces new faces that display different types of informations, such as Siri reminders or more visual ones that feature Toy Story characters a la Mickey Mouse. There’s also a fitness-focused update, which includes monthly challenges to encourage the wearer to get more active and NFC-enabled data sharing where the user can tap their Apple Watch on gym equipment to pair the two, sharing the most accurate calorie burn and activity information. There’s also a new Music app to make finding and playing music via the Apple Watch more visual — you can now use a new dock layout to scroll through recently opened apps.
