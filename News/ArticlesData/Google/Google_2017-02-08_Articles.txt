Both are really good things. It's time for Android Wear to get a reboot. Today Google launched a new version of its smartwatch OS, along with two LG watches, the LG Watch Sport (shown above) and the LG Watch Style (below.) Wear 2.0 has been growing in plain sight for months now, as Google released multiple versions of its software development kit. We had a hands on with an early version of the OS way back in May. Android Wear 2.0 becomes much more usable by bringing itself in line with Samsung's and Apple's approach to watch apps. Previously, Android Wear really tried to predict what you wanted to see, resulting in an ever changing parade of unexpected cards. It also didn't really run apps itself; it was entirely dependent on your phone. Now, Android Wear will have its own app store, an on-watch app menu, and independent apps, making it a much more flexible and predictable wrist-mounted computer. Tapping and swiping to launch apps and check out information will run much more predictably. "In the new app launcher, app icons are aligned in a circular arrangement around the edge of the watch display, and you can scroll through using the rotating side button," LG says. "The rotating side button also allows you to read long messages without constantly swiping." The watches become more interactive, with Google Assistant offering a conversational voice interface and a slew of options for responding to messages including dictation, typing on a tiny keyboard, handwriting, and drawing. Watch faces are getting a boost too, with 'complications,' essentially widgets which can plug into watch faces to provide additional information. Apple has had those for a while. Google clearly needs a renaissance here. According to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, no Android Wear watch vendor was in the top five wearables vendors at the end of 2016, and the only notable smartwatch in terms of sales was the Apple Watch. "Smart wearables capable of running third party apps will likely continue to struggle in the near term," the analyst firm said. The LG Watch Sport. Two New Watches from LG Android Wear 2.0 launches with the LG Watch Style and the LG Watch Sport. The Style looks like the smallest Android Wear watch we've seen yet, with 18mm swappable bands and a "rotating power button" which seems to operate a lot like Apple's "digital crown" as a physical control for the watch's UI. The Sport is "Android Wear's most powerful watch," according to Google. It's sort of like a demo platform to show off every feature possible in Android Wear. It's bigger than the Style, with NFC, GPS, 4G LTE, a heart rate monitor, and dedicated buttons for Google Fit and Android Pay. The Sport is 14mm thick and has a 1.38-inch, 480-by-480 screen, 768MB of RAM, and 4GB of storage. It's IP68 water resistant. LG says its battery lasts a day. The Style is 11mm thick with a 1.2-inch, 360-by-360 display, 512MB of RAM, and 4GB of storage, and it's IP67 water resistant. Both watches run on the new Qualcom Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, and both watches charge by sitting in wireless cradles. Related The Best Smartwatches of 2017 The Best Smartwatches of 2017 The Watch Style will be going on sale Feb. 10 at Best Buy and the Google Store for $249, and the Sport will be going on sale at AT&T and Verizon for $349. Other Android Wear watches will get the new software "in the coming weeks." That includes the ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Casio PRO TREK Smart, Fossil Q Founder, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Wander, Huawei Watch, LG G Watch R, LG Watch Urbane and 2nd Edition LTE, Michael Kors Access Smartwatches, Moto 360 2nd Gen, Moto 360 for Women, Moto 360 Sport, New Balance RunIQ, Nixon Mission, Polar M600, and TAG Heuer Connected.

Allies include Mozilla, Microsoft and Facebook, but we can expect some rough patches. Virtual Reality Apps by Stephen Shankland 10 February 2017 5:00 am AEDT @stshank Google's Chrome browser logo Stephen Shankland/CNET Google says it's now time to marry two computing realms: the web and virtual reality. Its latest version of the Chrome browser includes a technology called WebVR, which lets programmers create websites that present the computer-generated 3D worlds of virtual reality. If you're into VR, you might appreciate the promise WebVR holds for expanding what you can do with a device like a Google Daydream View or a Facebook Oculus Rift VR headset. That's because, in principle at least, WebVR makes it easier for developers to create a single VR experience that'll work across many VR headsets instead of having to create a separate version for each device. It's an extension of how a single website can span your laptop, Android phone or iPad tablet. WebVR makes it "as easy to step inside Air Force One as it is to access your favorite web page," Megan Lindsay, a product manager on Google's Chrome team, said in a blog post. WebVR without anything to look at isn't any fun, so here are some sites Google promoted for the technology: Bear 71, an interactive nature documentary; Matterport, a library of more than 300,000 celebrity homes and other sites; Within, a collection of VR movies; WebVR Lab, a collection of interactive VR worlds, and Sketchfab, an assortment of VR scenes. Google developed WebVR along with Firefox maker Mozilla, Facebook's Oculus team, and other partners. It's early days though. Microsoft is working on WebVR support for its new Edge browser and HoloLens eyewear, but support is still spotty among makers of VR headsets like HTC's Vive and Samsung's Gear VR. So far, Mozilla has enabled WebVR only in its nightly and developer versions of Firefox aimed at web programmers and the adventurous. But it plans to add WebVR in the mainstream version of its browser this summer, including support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Chrome supports Google's Daydream View headset, which like Gear VR uses a phone to track head motion and display imagery for each eye. But it'll be months before WebVR and Chrome work with the company's cruder Google Cardboard cousin.

Earlier this week she responded to the board's conclusion that Mr Worner has done nothing wrong following an independent investigation into his conduct and credit card spending. On Tuesday she tweeted love letters she received from him and receipts that she says contradict the board's finding. The latest online spray demonstrates Ms Harrison still holds a cache of sensitive company information and is releasing it selectively. It also sheds light on the network's dealings with the Corby family ahead of the release of Schapelle Corby from Kerobokan prison, where she served nine years for drug smuggling.

It reads "We got Mercedes' signature late last night. So very close". Mercedes Corby was deeply involved in her sister's media negotiations. The email does not say what the signature was for. It was sent on February 8, 2014, two days before Schapelle Corby left jail. Advertisement Is my case the first cover up Seven West Media has been involved in?

The court case also heard New Idea, published by Seven subsidiary Pacific Magazines, sent Mercedes Corby a letter that referred to a $25,000 payment. A second screen shot tweeted by Ms Harrison shows Mr McWilliam emailed Seven West Media's board during the raid, reassuring them Seven was on the right side of the law.

It also got a public apology from the AFP for "unnecessary reputational damage". Seven has always denied there was any payment for the Sunday Night story or that any payment was made. A company spokesman on Thursday night said: "those emails relate to the AFP matter which was settled successfully in court and successfully gained an apology from the AFP". Ms Harrison is continuing her campaign against Seven out of frustration that Mr Worner has been forgiven for his behaviour, while the company pursues her over alleged credit card fraud. Seven commissioned Deloitte to investigate her credit card spending after she revealed the affair. Deloitte found she had allegedly misspent $186,000 of company money. Ms Harrison says she can prove all but $14,000 were legitimate work expenses, but has never been given the opportunity. "[These emails] speak to the character of the people in charge of the company who waged a legal war on me. [Board member] Jeff Kennett is right - it is an issue of character," she said, referring to a twitter war this week between herself and Mr Kennett over corporate governance.

By News Nation Bureau  |  Updated On : February 09, 2017 10:19 PM Google Play Store (Representational Image) New Delhi :   Google has been monitoring many apps in the Play Store which handle personal or sensitive data but lack a privacy policy. The tech giant has sent notices to developers of these apps. Google has asked developers to fix the issue with their apps by March 15 or has warned that administrative action will be taken. The company will remove those apps from Google Play if they violate User’s data policy. Google describes the “Privacy Policy and Secure Transmission” in User Data policy, “If your app handles personal or sensitive user data (including personally identifiable information, financial and payment information, authentication information, phonebook or contact data, microphone and camera sensor data, and sensitive device data) then your app must: 1)  Post a privacy policy in both the designated field in the Play Developer Console and from within the Play distributed app itself. 2)  Handle the user data securely, including transmitting it using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS).” Android user’s confidence will get boosted by this move of Google to remove apps that do not follow the guidelines set by the company, as users struggle to find the right app due to the presence of fake ones.

By Digit NewsDeskDigit NewsDesk Published Date 09 - Feb - 2017 | Last Updated 09 - Feb - 2017 Tweet   Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime (Gold, 32GB) 8999 Google has been awarded the Wi-Fi deal for the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCSCL). The company will work with companies like Larsen & Toubro, IBM and RailTel for what is the first such deal. The PSCSCL is a special purpose vehicle that has been created for the smart city project in Pune. it was registered in March 2016, with seven stakeholders and 15 directors. The contract given to Google is reportedly valued at Rs. 150 crore. This includes operating expenditure, capital expenditure and revenue sharing elements. Kunal Kumar, Pune Minicipal Commissioner, told the Economic Times, that the work order was given to Google on January 6 this year and that 15-20% of the revenue generated will be shared with the authority. Google will be helping monetisation of the city’s Wi-Fi network and also dploy Google Station platform. This platform has both monetisation and WiFi network management capabilities. In addition, last mile fiber connectivity will be provided by RailTel, enabling WiFi hotspots in 200 locations across the city of Pune.

In essence, areas that are frequented by a large number of people can be handled by the platform. This would include places like malls, big shopping areas in cities and more. Google and RailTel have of course been working together to provide Wi-Fi at 400 railway stations in the country.

PHOTO: MARINA BAY SANDS The smartphone way to see a tropical jungle ArtScience Museum presents first augmented and virtual reality exhibition in Asia. Feb 10, 2017 5:50 AM by Cheah Ui-Hoonuihoon@sph.com.sg IMAGINE holding up a smartphone to walk through a virtual rainforest experience at the ArtScience Museum, and at the end of it, press a button to have a real tree planted in Central Sumatera. The latest exhibition at the science-based museum marries conservation, technology and real life engagement - the first effort of its kind. Into The Wild, the ArtScience Museum's new permanent exhibition, could also be called Into The Future as it signals a new era of augmented reality museum experiences. It's the first museum experience in Asia - and second in the world, after an art institute in Detroit, USA - to use augmented reality, through Google's Tango technology and Lenovo's latest smartphone, Phab 2 Pro. There are no objects except a smartphone the viewer holds. It also brings rainforest conservation issues into the air-conditioned space of Marina Bay Sands. By holding up the smartphone in their walk through the museum's fourth level corridor, viewers encounter a virtual rainforest scene complete with butterflies leading the way and they will see five rainforest animals, like the endangered Sumatran tiger. The tour finally culminates in a cinematic animation created by local filmmaker Brian Gothong Tan. SEE ALSO: Xiaomi's Barra to lead Facebook's virtual reality efforts But the exhibition doesn't end once you leave the museum. If the viewer agrees to sponsor a tree for a minimum S$38 donation, WWF will continue to keep them updated on the growth of the tree and its impact on the wildlife and local communities in Rimbang Bali, a pristine rainforest area which is six times the size of Singapore. Tech link "We wanted an exhibition that would also have a real world impact," says Honor Hagar, executive director of ArtScience Museum, in the launch of the exhibition yesterday. The exhibition will be free for the public, and there are about 50 devices on loan at any one time. Explaining how the exhibition came about, Ms Hagar says the museum has long had ties with WWF, working on sustainable issues. It also talked to Google about possible collaborations. It finally managed to tie up two themes: conservation and technology, when it found out that rainforest rehabilitation is a major priority with WWF. Justin Quimby, senior product manager for Google's Tango, notes that the new software allows devices to better understand the world around us, though motion tracking, depth perception and area learning. Motion tracking captures how the device moves through space, depth perception enables it to register objects, and area learning enables it to recognise the environment it's in. "All that enables immersive experiences," he explains. Based on this pilot project, Google plans to work with more museums for educational projects. This is the next generation of smartphone capabilities, he adds, and there are currently 35 Tango-enabled applications available through Google Playstore. Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro, meanwhile, is the world's first Tango-enabled phone, powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 652. Meanwhile, Elaine Tan, CEO of WWF Singapore, says that technology has helped close the divide between the urban city and the natural environmens, and makes it possible for technology to build empathy for the environment. Rimbang Bali, which WWF adopted as a project last year, was chosen for the subject and case study for Into the Wild because the haze experienced in Singapore is attributed to forest burning in Indonesia. It's an issue that affects Singaporeans every year, Ms Tan points out. Nature link This conservation project then should hit close to home for Singapore. Rimbang Bali has 439,500 hectares of rainforest and is home to more than 170 bird sub-species, and no less than 50 mammals including iconic species such as Malayan tapirs, Malayan sun bears, clouded leopards and the Sumatran serow. It's also an important tiger breeding area, serving as a "tiger corridor" connecting otherwise isolated tiger landscapes to the south, east and north of Rimbang Bali. However, there are only two wildlife rangers assigned to this area by the Indonesian government as it's not demarcated as a national park. WWF provided much of the footage and wildlife knowledge to the programmers who were drawing up the virtual rainforest. "This is the first time we're engaging in this kind of public engagement - with a commitment to follow through with the public on their pledges by keeping them informed," says Ms Tan. The organisation aims to plant some 20,000 fruit trees for the first phase of this programme to support both wildlife and local communities. Into the Wild is located at the fourth level of ArtScience Museum, Marina Bay Sands. The experience is free for visitors during the museum's opening hours from 10am-7pm daily.

More videos Apple appeals EU tax ruling Apple has launched a legal challenge to a record $US14 billion EU tax demand, arguing that EU regulators ignored tax experts and corporate law, and deliberately picked a method to maximise the penalty. Recall that in August Apple was ordered by repay €13 billion in taxes and interest after European Commission found the software giant's Irish tax structure was "illegal under EU state aid rules".  This week Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician, who is currently serving as the European Commissioner for Competition and took on the Apple case last year, said that regardless of what Trump does ("whatever US tax reform they may pass is, of course, for them") the ruling stands. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US President Donald Trump would give multinationals a special tax break if they brought profits to be taxed back to the US. Photo: Bloomberg "What is important for us is ... if any company or group of companies gets selective advantages by member states and thereby unlevelling (sic) the playing field." But what if other countries might want a share of the tax owed? Advertisement As Vestager noted a her statement after the decision last year: "It may be that not all the unpaid taxes are due in Ireland. Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation." She continues: "If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, says the ruling against Apple stands. Photo: AP This leads to Trump's tax plan. He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  Photo: AP   "Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated," the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings. Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion. ITEP report Ordinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe. No wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  But it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday. The ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore – Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America. The report suggests  that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate. "In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion," it says. Rather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings. Meanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures. Apple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures. According to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016. Its profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years.  The tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Thankfully, for the past couple years, Google implemented a lottery system — not a first-come, first-served basis. While I’m not huge on my chances of winning a lottery, it’s still better than what Google had before. Needless to say, Google has made available the time at which the application window will open: Wednesday, February 22 at 10AM PST. At that time, anyone can enter for a chance to win a spot to attend Google I/O 2017. Whether you are first to enter or last to enter, you have an equal chance of winning a spot. And don’t forget, Google I/O 2017 takes place May 17 through 19 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CA. Mark your calendars, hopeful attendees.

A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that the U.S. will remain open to refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim-majority countries, rejecting a bid by the Trump administration to reinstate a travel ban in the name of national security. The administration will act anew on immigration next week, President Donald Trump said Friday. "We’ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country; you’ll be seeing that some time next week," Trump said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday. He offered no specifics on the plan, which he announced in response to a question about his immigration order. Joe Scarborough of MSNBC reported Friday morning, citing unidentified sources, that the White House is working on a new executive order with more specific language. A federal judge in Virginia plans to rule as soon as possible on extending a block on Trump’s ban on travel to the U.S. by residents of seven majority-Muslim countries. The Virginia case is one of a handful with the potential to more permanently keep the administration’s order on hold. The San Francisco-based appeals court spurned the government's request to close the doors after days of public debate over Trump's attacks on the judicial system and a rush of fearful immigrants. The case is the biggest test of Trump's executive power yet. Trump was defiant, tweeting within minutes of the ruling: SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 The public "has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination," a three-judge panel said in a unanimous 29-page ruling. The panel's ruling in favor of immigrants is a victory not only for Washington and Minnesota — the states that sued — but for Facebook Inc., Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which said in court papers that the measure would hinder their global businesses. The measure has engendered lawsuits from coast to coast that present early and crucial tests of the president's unilateral ability to decide who threatens the nation. Opponents of the ban argue it violates due process and equal-protection rights, and runs afoul of the First Amendment's prohibition of favor for any one religion. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said the administration is reviewing the decision and considering its options. Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued to the appeals panel on Tuesday that Trump's statements as a candidate were ample proof that the ban was intended to discriminate against Muslims. "It's remarkable to have this much evidence of intent," he said. 'Complete shutdown' In a Dec. 7 statement posted on his website, Trump had called "for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what's going on." August Flentje, representing the Justice Department, reminded the appeals panel during the hearing that a Boston federal judge in a separate case refused to consider Trump's statements. The order doesn't target Muslims, he said. Since U.S. District Judge James Robart temporarily blocked Trump's ban, refugees and travelers have been rushing to the U.S. The executive order had set off chaos as states, companies, universities, citizens and refugees struggled with the ramifications. On Wednesday, Trump read a law that gives the president authority to stop the entry of "any class" of foreigner. "You can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want," Trump told a conference of police chiefs and sheriffs in Washington. "It just can't be written any plainer or better." Twitter messages Since the ruling, the president, a 70-year-old Republican, has sent Twitter messages excoriating Robart as a "so-called judge." Trump's order bars Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocks for 120 days all others fleeing their homelands claiming persecution or fear of violence. No citizens of Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Libya or Sudan could enter the U.S. for 90 days. Washington and Minnesota argued that the ban hurt residents and businesses, and their case was bolstered by a documents filed by Facebook, Google and Microsoft and a declaration by former government officials, including former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former CIA directors Michael Hayden and Leon Panetta and former United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice. In the suit, the states argued that the ban had an immediate impact on companies by limiting their ability to conduct business and recruit, and harmed universities by stranding faculty and students. Washington's lawyers argued the travel ban is a "draconian restriction." Lucas Powe, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Trump could avoid the constitutional showdown simply by rescinding the executive order and rewriting it in a less rushed manner. "I can't figure out why the Trump administration doesn't just go back to the drawing board and have his lawyers rewrite," Powe said. "I'm sure that some order dealing with immigration can be successfully written." "The courts seem to be so political," Trump said in a speech on Wednesday. "It's so sad." Traditionally, presidents have shied from commenting on active cases for fear of being accused of trying to influence judges. Trump's Jan. 27 executive order followed campaign promises to stop Muslims from entering the country and roiled world politics. It shut out citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which Trump argues nurture enemies of the U.S. The government recommended that more than 1,200 people not be allowed on flights and revoked about 60,000 visas. The appeals court refused to reinstate Trump's order after a Seattle judge halted enforcement while courts decide whether it's constitutional. The executive order has been the most consequential act of a young and aggressive administration that wants to minimize America's engagement with the world. Trump and his advisers see Islamist terrorism as a threat best defused by halting the flow of people who might be secretly planning attacks. The president's action initially denied entry to an Iraqi who helped U.S. military, professors at the University of Massachusetts and a student seeking to bring her daughter for medical treatment. The ban set off angry protests nationwide and attracted a flurry of lawsuits and adverse rulings. None was more sweeping than that of Robart in Seattle. Washington and Minnesota won the order temporarily blocking the ban nationwide after arguing it hurt their residents and employers including Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and the Mayo Clinic. The fight is far from over. The court battle so far has focused on whether the president's order should be paused while courts weigh larger issues. Robart already ordered both sides to submit additional arguments focusing on the substance of the case: whether the states have a right to sue and whether Trump's order discriminates against Muslims.

SUBSCRIBE Data: Google monthly search volume dwarfs rivals because of mobile advantage Google likely has 30+ billion queries per month across platforms. Greg Sterling on February 9, 2017 at 5:53 pm More In the past year, comScore has de-emphasized its search market share and mobile market share reports. Part of the reason is that the numbers don’t change that much anymore. In addition, for reasons that remain mysterious, the measurement firm has declined to present a consolidated view of the search marketplace that includes both desktop and mobile. Mobile search is now both larger and, in many respects, more important than desktop search. Below are the most recent comScore PC search market share and query volume figures for December 2016: Across the board, desktop search queries are down vs. November. Google’s overall share remains basically stable at 63+ percent. Microsoft continues its slow growth on the PC, while the others continue their slow declines. It’s worth noting again that Bing powers search results for AOL, Yahoo, Siri + Spotlight search and Amazon, which is not reflected above. On mobile devices, it’s mostly a story about Google, however. According to data from StatCounter, Google controls about 95 percent of mobile search query volume on a global basis. Even if this number is not entirely accurate — some people are critical of StatCounter data — it’s beyond dispute that Google has a massive lead in mobile search. Global Smartphone Search Market Share (StatCounter) We know from Google itself that at least 50 percent of its global query volume is now from mobile devices. The number varies by category but is probably closer to 60 percent overall. If we assume that the comScore PC query volume figures are accurate, Google had roughly 15 billion desktop searches in the US this past December. If so, Google is seeing at least 15 billion more from US mobile devices, which is partly how the company is able to keep generating strong financial results even as desktop queries are flat. At the end of last year, according to comScore, smartphone penetration among mobile phone owners passed 80 percent. That means there are now more than 200 million smartphone in the US, which is probably a conservative number.

Her selling point is the use of Chrome for Android to access virtual reality content on the web that can be experienced in the new Daydream View headset. The drawback, of course, is that there are only three phones that currently support Daydream, with two additional phones listed as “coming soon.” But the real message here is that Google is working to bring web-based VR content to all devices and headsets through its Chrome browser. “In the coming months we’ll add support for more headsets, including Google Cardboard,” Lindsay stated. To access the VR content on a Daydream-ready phone, users first load up the Chrome browser, find the content they want to view, choose the VR option, and then shove the phone into the Daydream View headset. Otherwise, web surfers can view the same content on any phone or PC but are limited using their finger or mouse to interact with the content. Here is a list of content highlighted in Lindsay’s blog: Bear 71: This is an interactive documentary that “blurs the lines between the wild world and the wired one.” The Matterport Library: It is a tour of over 300,000 celebrity homes, museums, canyons, and other interesting locations across the globe. Within: This is a library of 28 VR films such as Walking New York, Notes On Blindness, Vice News VR, and more. Sketchfab: This site offers a huge library of VR scenes to experience including the Mars One mission base, a motorcycle clubhouse, a Batman Begins set, and so on. The WebVR Lab: This is a demonstration of the capabilities of WebVR, allowing viewers to switch records on a record player, pick up dice, and move around the environment. In these cases, the applications depend on an experimental version of JavaScript called WebVR. This enables the applications to speak directly to VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, and Google Cardboard. Support for WebVR was added to Google Chrome version 56 for Android and in experimental builds for PC. It is built into Mozilla’s Firefox browser too. More: Waiting on a Google Pixel? Verizon may treat you to a free Daydream View Just for kicks, we tested a few of these on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Gear VR, and the demos worked just fine using Samsung’s browser. Keep in mind that these experiences are entirely web-based, and given that WebVR is still “experimental,” performance will be lower than dedicated optimized apps. For instance, the WebVR Lab demo by Playcanvas was jerky when looking around but showcased the capabilities of WebVR’s current state. The Mars demo was rather neat too, if not choppy in movement, and highly jagged along the edges. Still, the WebVR demo enables (mostly) free movement around the Martian base whereas the same demo offered through Sketchfab’s app for Gear VR limits visitors to five stationary points in the scene.

Three judges at the ninth US circuit court of appeals ruled unanimously that a nationwide temporary restraining order (TRO) imposed last week must stay in place, meaning the executive order banning travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugee entries cannot be enforced. President Trump reacted angrily to the court decision, branding it “political” and declaring: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! February 9, 2017 The judges said the government had failed to show an “urgent need” for the travel ban to be reinstated, noting that it had provided “no evidence” that any travellers from the countries targeted by the ban had committed terror offences in the US. The court – which was ruling only on whether the travel ban should be reinstated or not – made no finding on claims by the states of Washington and Minnesota, which brought the case, that it was in effect a Muslim ban, based on religious discrimination. But the judges said future hearings could take into account earlier statements made by Trump in which he had pledged such a ban. The government claim that a national security order from the president was “unreviewable” was dismissed by the judges: There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy. You can read the full ruling from the judges here and their key decisions here. ‘Complete victory’: attorney general celebrates Trump travel ban verdict The government could challenge the appeals court decision or file an emergency appeal with the supreme court.

Thanks for reading. Updated at 2.36am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.50am EST 01:50 What the judges said Here are the key areas in which the three judges said they could not back the arguments of the federal government. ‘Unreviewable’ claim ‘contrary to constitutional democracy’ In a strongly worded ruling – read it in full here – the judges rejected the justice department argument that the president’s national security orders were “unreviewable”: There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy … In short, although courts owe considerable deference to the president’s policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security, it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action. No evidence of terror threat The judges said the government had failed to make a case that there was an urgent need to block travellers from entering the US: Although we agree that ‘the government’s interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order’ … the government has done little more than reiterate that fact … The government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. ‘Shifting interpretations of executive order’ They were scathing on the confusion that surrounded the rights of lawful permanent residents caught up in the travel ban: We cannot rely upon the government’s contention that the executive order no longer applies to lawful permanent residents … Moreover, in light of the government’s shifting interpretations of the executive order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings. ‘Serious allegations’ of religious discrimination The judges did not make a ruling on the argument by the states that the executive order discriminates on religious grounds and is effectively a “Muslim ban”. But they said previous comments by Trump and his team could be taken into account in future hearings on whether the travel ban “was motivated by a discriminatory purpose”: The states have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a ‘Muslim ban’ as well as evidence they claim suggests that the executive order was intended to be that ban … The states’ claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions. In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed. No explanation of ‘urgent need’ to reinstate ban The judges said they did not see “an urgent need” for the ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries to be reinstated: Although the government points to the fact that congress and the executive identified the seven countries named in the executive order as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016, the government has not offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the executive order to be immediately reinstated. The federal government’s application to have the temporary restraining order lifted – and the travel ban reinstated – was denied. Updated at 2.35am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.31am EST 01:31 In the hearing on Tuesday, August Flentje, the department of lawyer acting on behalf of the federal government, argued that the executive order issued by the president was not reviewable. The judges in their ruling roundly rejected this: The government contends that the district court lacked authority to enjoin enforcement of the executive order because the president has ‘unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of aliens’ … The government has taken the position that the president’s decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections … There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.

Citing nine unnamed current and former US officials, the Post said some senior US officials interpreted the contacts as a “potentially illegal” signal to Russia that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in December. National security adviser Michael Flynn now says he can’t remember if he discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA Reuters reported last month, citing three sources familiar with the matter, that Flynn had held five phone calls with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak on 29 December, the day then-President Barack Obama retaliated for Moscow’s alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The Post said Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador, but on Thursday backed away from the denial through a spokesman. Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up”, the Post quoted the spokesman as saying.

In a statement the White House said the leaders of the world’s two largest economies had held a “lengthy” and “extremely cordial” telephone call on Thursday evening in which “numerous topics” were discussed. “President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our ‘One China’ policy,” the White House said, referring to a diplomatic understanding by which Washington does not challenge China’s claim over Taiwan, a democratically ruled island that Beijing considers a breakaway province. Following his shock election in November last year, Trump had infuriated and unnerved Beijing by questioning his administration’s commitment to that policy and holding an unprecedented phone conversation with Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen. On Tuesday some of the world’s leading China specialists warned that already “precarious” ties between Beijing and Washington could be plunged into a dangerous new era, partly as a result of Trump’s rise to power.

For now, it can’t be enforced. The nationwide temporary restraining order (TRO) imposed last week by the district court in Seattle has been upheld today, so travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries named in the executive order are, for now, not banned from entering the US (though pre-existing visa restrictions still apply). The federal government has 14 days to ask the ninth circuit appeals court to reconsider its decision. It might not fancy its chances there, given the unanimous (per curiam) ruling. But Trump has indicated, via an angry tweet, that the court fight goes on. So the government could file an emergency appeal with the US supreme court. Associated Press says this would go to Justice Anthony Kennedy for referral to the rest of the court. In the meantime – given that today’s ruling relates to the TRO on the travel ban and not on the longterm future (or otherwise) of the travel ban itself – the appeals court has set out a schedule to hear fuller arguments on that. As AP explains: That prompted some confusion among those watching the case, many of whom expected it to be returned to the Seattle courthouse. Washington’s lawyer, state solicitor general Noah Purcell, wrote to the Seattle court’s clerk late Thursday to note the state wouldn’t be making an expected court filing because of the new appellate briefing schedule. Barring an immediate appeal to the supreme court, the government’s opening brief is due 3 March, with the states’ filing due 24 March.

Here’s the readout of the call from the White House: President Donald J Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had a lengthy telephone conversation on Thursday evening. The two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our “one China” policy. Representatives of the United States and China will engage in discussions and negotiations on various issues of mutual interest. The phone call between President Trump and President Xi was extremely cordial, and both leaders extended best wishes to the people of each other’s countries. They also extended invitations to meet in their respective countries. President Trump and President Xi look forward to further talks with very successful outcomes. As the Guardian’s China correspondent Benjamin Haas explains: “One China” is an arrangement dating back to the 1970s under which countries can maintain formal diplomatic relations with China or Taiwan, but not both. After the Communists won the Chinese civil war in 1949, defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Both Beijing and Taipei claimed sovereignty over the entirety of China. Taiwan’s official name is the Republic of China. Until 1971, Taiwan held China’s seat at the United Nations and the following years saw a wave of states switch to recognise the Beijing government. The US formally established relations with China in 1979, but maintains informal ties with Taiwan. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.34pm EST 22:34 Some insight from Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare, on what the ruling really means: Are there tea leaves to read in this opinion? There sure are, particularly with respect to the judges’ analysis of the government’s likelihood of prevailing on the merits and its blithe dismissal of the government’s claims of national security necessity on pages 26-27 – a matter on which the per curiam spends only one sentence and one brief footnote. But it’s worth emphasizing that the grounds on which this order was fought are not the grounds on which the merits fight will happen. Eventually, the court has to confront the clash between a broad delegation of power to the President – a delegation which gives him a lot of authority to do a lot of not-nice stuff to refugees and visa holders – in a context in which judges normally defer to the president, and the incompetent malevolence with which this order was promulgated.

Donna Brazile, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, celebrated the decision in a statement. “This is a massive blow to the White House. The court upheld that we do not discriminate based on religion. That is what terrorists do, and what terrorists want us to do.” The Washington state attorney general, Bob Ferguson, agreed: “The bottom line this is a complete victory for the state of Washington. “We are a nation of laws as I have said … from day one, those laws apply to everyone in our country and that includes the president of the United States.” In contrast, Republican Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas railed against the ruling. “No foreigner has a constitutional right to enter the United States and courts ought not second-guess sensitive national-security decisions of the president. This misguided ruling is from the ninth circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in America and the most reversed court at the supreme court,” said Cotton in a statement. Senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway, speaking on Fox News, expressed confidence that the ruling simply represented a bump in the road. “It is an interim ruling and we are fully confident that when we get our day in court and argue it on the merits we will prevail.” Trump travel ban hits major setback after judges uphold temporary restraining order Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.50pm EST 21:50 The Washington Post has just published a report claiming that Trump’s national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, did discuss sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the month before the inauguration – despite explicit denials by Flynn and vice-president Mike Pence. It reports: On Thursday, Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial. The spokesman said Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.” The Washington Post says it had verified the content of the communications – which it says were by text message, by phone and in person: Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. All of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president. “Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” said a former official.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Gadgets Five ways to speed up your Android devices Published February 10, 2017February 10, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Is your Android device running slow? Here are five tips to help you speed it up: Pinpoint the problem According to Jumia Travel, it can be an app, multiple apps, the storage or the system itself slowing down your device. Before you either fix your device yourself or give it to a technician to help you fix it, it is important you try to identify what the problem is or may be, and what the problem isn’t. With this knowledge, the problem will be easier for you to solve on your own or, if you decide to give the phone to a technician instead, it will help you avoid being cheated. A diagnostic app can help you pinpoint the problem causing your device to run slowly. Phone Doctor Plus and Z-device Test are good diagnostic apps to consider. You can find them on Google Play Store. Some Android devices come with diagnostic apps, like Samsung with the Samsung Smart Care app. In this case, you can take advantage of that rather than downloading another from the Google Play Store. Clear your cache data This is more or less a temporary solution if your device’s slowness is caused by the unnecessary or ‘rarely used’ apps you installed. Cache data eats up system resources (takes up storage space on your device), while slowing down your device. You should clear this data from time to time or install a cache clearing app, like Clean Master from the Google Play Store. You have nothing to fear deleting this data, anything important will simply be re-cached the next time you open the app. This is considered a temporary solution because you’ll eventually have to delete some of these apps you are clearing the cached data of,to more permanently fix the problem of your device running slowly. Uninstall and disable unnecessary apps If after diagnosing the problem, you find that a certain app or the multiple apps you installed on your device is causing your device to run slowly, you should immediately uninstall it. For apps that you cannot delete (those that come preloaded on your phone and are otherwise called ‘bloatware’), you should disable as many as you are not using to keep them from running in the background, choking your device’s storage and interfering with its speed and efficiency. You can uninstall or disable apps through the app manager found in your device’s settings, and keep these apps from becoming the ‘resource hogs’ that slow down your Android device. Note: You should also learn to close all apps you are no longer using. Don’t just open it and change to another app without closing the one you previously opened. This helps to free up your RAM and improve your device’s performance. Free up your device storage Aside uninstalling unnecessary apps, especially if the problem is caused by insufficient storage, you should also delete some of the many files (music, videos, documents etc.) that are filling up your internal storage. Make the sacrifice; delete those files you don’t actually need but keep for sentimental reasons. If you want to avoid losing certain files completely, you can transfer them to another device (another phone, a laptop, or a tablet) or a flash drive or hard drive. Note: You can also consider disabling some of the widgets running on your device that you are not really using, alongside animations and live wallpapers you have running on your phone. Widgets, animations and live wallpapers may be fanciful, but they affect your device’s performance and battery live. Perform a factory data reset Over time, a lot goes on in your device’s software so it’s always advisable to give your device a fresh start from time to time. Know that this should not be done often, only from time to time, especially when all the other tips don’t work as well as you want them to do. A factory data reset will wipe your device clean and leave the software the way it was when you first turned on the device; so be sure to backup important files before you do this. Some Android devices come with a “Backup and Reset” option in the device’s settings, so you can take advantage of that. Some other devices have a recovery menu for backing up important files. The steps are different for every device, so you can use Google to help you out with the steps for your device. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Recall that in August Apple was ordered by repay €13 billion in taxes and interest after European Commission found the software giant's Irish tax structure was "illegal under EU state aid rules".  This week Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician, who is currently serving as the European Commissioner for Competition and took on the Apple case last year, said that regardless of what Trump does ("whatever US tax reform they may pass is, of course, for them") the ruling stands. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US President Donald Trump would give multinationals a special tax break if they brought profits to be taxed back to the US. Photo: Bloomberg "What is important for us is ... if any company or group of companies gets selective advantages by member states and thereby unlevelling (sic) the playing field." But what if other countries might want a share of the tax owed? Advertisement As Vestager noted a her statement after the decision last year: "It may be that not all the unpaid taxes are due in Ireland. Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation." She continues: "If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, says the ruling against Apple stands. Photo: AP This leads to Trump's tax plan. He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  Photo: AP   "Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated," the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings. Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion. ITEP report Ordinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe. No wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  But it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday. The ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore – Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America. The report suggests  that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate. "In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion," it says. Rather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings. Meanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures. Apple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures. According to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016. Its profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years.  The tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Will Soon Remove Junk Apps From Play Store For Violating User Data Policy By Zara Ali Feb 8, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google had earlier hinted that it will be monitoring the Play Store closely, especially for keeping a check on privacy policy adherence by apps. Following the process, since the last 24 hours, Google had been sending notices to app developers worldwide. In the official notice, the search engine giant is warning developers towards impending action such as “limited visibility” or “app removal” if there is violation of User Data policy. The reason behind sending the notification is to combat the apps that snoop on user data. The action will affect the fake apps that are created for the sole purpose of stealing user data. Such apps will face the major jolt of the cleansing drive executed by Google. For the ones who will avoid the notice and make no changes to their app’s functionality – their app will be removed from Google Play Store. Here’s the screenshot of the warning message: In the notice, Google warns app developers to include privacy policy by March 15. If they fail to do so, then Google will either remove their app from the Play store or limit the visibility. Commenting on the cleansing drive by Google, Hip Hop Ninja app developer, Jack Cooney told The Next Web: Advertisement I think it’s fantastic, this will clear the Google Play store of so many junk and zombie apps that our games will find increased visibility on the store as the search terms will become much less cluttered. This will make it easier for people to be able to find our app’s like Hop Hop Ninja! with better keyword searches like ninja or Nerd Agency and find much more relevant results. (A previous pain point of developing for Android). For the developers who run authentic apps and have a clean privacy policy, this move will be a boon in disguise as it will wipe off fake apps and increase the visibility of original apps. In simple terms, it will declutter Play Store and help users in installing apps that have no hidden data stealing algorithms. Foldable Devices From Apple and Google Could Come Very Soon Thanks to LG Partnership One of the major shortcomings on Play Store is the presence of so many apps, which make it tough for users to find accurately what they are looking for on the platform. This new move will delete junk apps from the Play Store and strengthen keyword search for official apps. Google’s cleansing drive will be a strong move to ensure the adherence of user privacy policy.

Sections Deseret NewsFamily Family ClearPlay can no longer stream new movies through Google. Here's what that means for VidAngel By Herb ScribnerDeseret News@HerbScribner Published: Feb. 9, 2017 3:40 p.m. Updated: yesterday 7 Comments On Tuesday, ClearPlay, a Salt Lake City-based company that streams filtered Hollywood films, confirmed with Deadline that Google has prevented the service from streaming any new movies since the fall. “ClearPlay filtering continues to work with stream content available through Google Play, except for new movie releases. We have been relying on certain programming interfaces that are no longer available through Google Play,” ClearPlay co-founder and CEO Matthew Jarman said in a statement. Jarman said in the statement that he expects new releases will come later in 2017 with the help of a major streaming service provider. VidAngel attorney David Quinto told the Deseret News that “this is major news” that will have ramifications in the ongoing court case between VidAngel and four Hollywood studios — Disney, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 20th Century Fox Film Corporation and Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC — which say VidAngel violated copyright laws by streaming films without permission. In that case, VidAngel argued that the company had the right to edit streamed films through the Family Movie Act, Quinto said. But in December, Judge Andre Birotte Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Los Angeles issued an injunction against the streaming service, citing ClearPlay as a service that filters content correctly. Birotte wrote in his decision that ClearPlay observed the law correctly, unlike VidAngel. “An injunction in this case would not prevent VidAngel or any other company from providing a filtering service similar to ClearPlay’s, and thus wouldn’t negatively impact the public interest in watching filtered content in private,” Birotte wrote, according to Deadline. As a result of the decision, VidAngel halted its streaming service at the end of December, company CEO Neal Harmon said in a statement. “There’s a federal law that says you can stream filtered movies,” Harmon told Variety. “But today, there’s absolutely no way to do so. The studios got what they wanted.” According to Quinto, ClearPlay hasn’t streamed new movies since September, and that contradicts information the studios provided the courts back in December. Google made changes to its policies in regards to filtered streaming which took effect in September 2016, he said. “New information reveals that there is no way anyone can filter and stream new Hollywood movies today and that the evidence to the contrary the studios gave the court was in fact incorrect,” Harmon said in a statement. VidAngel learned of this development after a ClearPlay customer informed VidAngel that he or she could not find new movies on ClearPlay's website. 7 comments on this story “We checked ClearPlay’s site and verified that no new movie has been added since September 2016. The last available streamed movies were ‘Ghostbusters’ (published in early September) and ‘Independence Day’ (published in August). No movies posted since then are streaming enabled. That had escaped our notice during trial because older videos were still up and running,” according to VidAngel's statement. Quinto said he hopes people who want to stream family-friendly and filtered content in private contact Congress. “Let them know that the Family Movie Act has been disabled entirely,” he said. Quinto said VidAngel asked studios on Tuesday to inform the court it was wrong about ClearPlay. Quinto also said they’re deciding whether or not to allow the current case to settle in the court of appeals or take it to trial. 7 Comments Like that? Read this.

This page is meant to get new hires, interns, or interested community members up to speed with the right software, configurations, and communication channels to contribute effectively to the release engineering pipeline. Video Introductions Release Engineering as a Force Multiplier by John O'Duinn (former director) about how Mozilla Release Engineering handles our business and how we work to improve each and every day. This crowd-sourced video list contains other videos about various aspects of working at Mozilla, including important information such as how to operate the espresso machine. Development Best Practices Read and keep up to date with: Development Best Practices Read and keep up to date with: http://moz-releng-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ Please fix any issues you find: https://github.com/mozilla/build-relengdocs As someone new to the project, your fresh perspective helps shine a light on missing information or assumptions we take for granted. Single Sign-On (SSO) Many Mozilla services use SSO now, including Gmail, Drive, and ServiceNow. The Single Sign-On homepage has a list of the available services. NOTE: SSO requires that LDAP be setup first. Mail Mozilla mail is handled by Gmail now. You should be added to the release@mozilla.com google group as a new hire/intern. This mailing list is managed by Google groups. Owners of this group will be able to add you. Send a test message to release@m.c to verify that your address has been added/subscribed. Talk to your manager if it is not working. WARNING: release@m.c can contain security-sensitive information. Do not automatically forward your email to a system that is not under Mozilla's control. Mailing lists You'll need to manually subscribe to: release-engineering public mailing list mozilla.dev.planning mozilla.dev.tree-management These are available as newsgroups, google groups, and Mailman lists Mail Filtering With all that new email, you will want to set up some filters in Gmail (https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) to filter some of the higher-volume automated mail into a folder. You may eventually want to handle this information, but on day one hundreds of nagios notifications are not going to be educational. Here is an imperfect set of Gmail filters that you can import to get you started. A list of new (and some older) automated emails are indexed by subject, along with relevant actions, here. If you are going to working on puppet, you should also look at this page on how to read releng shared emails. Calendar Like mail, we now use Google calendar. You'll want to subscribe to the following public calendars: Release Engineering - Public Releng PTO Talk to your manager/mentor to get added to the various other private calendars as appropriate. Access Bugzilla Almost everything at Mozilla goes through Bugzilla. Create a Bugzilla account if you have not already. You'll need a few tweaks to your account to get access to everything releng-related: Add privileges for bugzilla group "build" (Mozilla Build Team) (Can be done by coop, catlee, hwine, or bugzilla admin.) Add your irc nickname & ldap username as "aliases" for your account log into bugzilla & follow links "Preferences" -> "Account Information" append the aliases, with a leading ':' and enclosed in brackets ('[]') to the "Real Name" field e.g.: "Hal Wine [:hwine]" Excellent video showing how to do power searches: Bugzilla Quick Search (5 minutes you NEED to give yourself) QuickSearch help Filing bugs against Release Engineering The product to use is, unsurprisingly, "Release Engineering." There are multiple possible components under that product, so take your best guess or ask for guidance in IRC. LDAP, SSH, VPN Warning for people who already have an LDAP account: Change your password. Otherwise, adding you to the releng group may lock your account without further notice. There is a stronger password policy in releng: users must change their password every 3 months. If you don't change your password, the only symptom will be that one day or another (already observed after 8 days), your regular password won't work anymore. If this happens to you, contact people in #servicedesk, they will be able to reset your password. This is mostly applicable only to employees and interns, although it *is* possible for other contributors to acquire some limited LDAP access. Speak to someone you work with on the releng team if you would like to investigate this. SSH keys are used for access to most machines, and some of them are stored in your LDAP record: Add your SSH public key to your LDAP account, at https://login.mozilla.com/ You'll need a number of other bits set in your LDAP object to access releng networks and systems via the VPN. Full instructions for accessing the VPN are on mana. this usually starts by generating a certificate at https://login.mozilla.com/ file a bug against Product/Component: Infrastructure & Operations/MOC: Service Requests asking to be added to the releng and vpn_releng groups. Something similar to bug 1223449 If you're on MacOSX or Windows, you might want to request a license for Viscosity (A VPN client). To do so from service-now. 'Order Stuff' > 'Software Applications' > 'Viscosity VPN' > 'Buisness Support && follow onscreen instructions Your manager is responsible for making sure you belong to the following LDAP groups, ideally before your first day: cn=balrog,ou=groups,dc=mozilla
cn=corp-vpn,ou=groups,dc=mozilla

 Common Machines Once your SSH public key is associated with your LDAP record, you should have access a number of shared Mozilla hosts: people.mozilla.org (account is not automatic, use service-now to request). hg.mozilla.org (use full email address as username) (commit access is not automatic, see below for access) Build Machines Releng runs many, many machines, including: staging and production buildbot masters staging and production slaves servers hosting a variety of services a handful of shared releng machines for development We access these machines via SSH (all), VNC (all), or remote desktop (Windows), depending on the context of the activity we're performing. To add your SSH key to the buildslaves, you'll need to do something like bug 899315. File a bug in "Release Engineering: Platform Support" Checkout the puppet repo and create a patch Ask for a reviewer. Your mentor/manager are good options here. If you need an account on cruncher (shared releng machine), ask catlee, and send him your SSH public key. (If you aren't sure you need the account, you probably do not for now.) SSH Config You'll want to update your ~/.ssh/config accordingly: Host hg.mozilla.org git.mozilla.org
    User <short-ldap-name-here>@mozilla.com
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 300

Host *.mozilla.com
    User <short-ldap-name-here>
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 300

Host *.build.mozilla.org
    Compression yes
    User cltbld
    ServerAliveInterval 300 Mercurial (hg) Most development in releng (and at Mozilla writ-large) is stored in version control using hg. There is an excellent step-by-step guide for setting up and using hg: Mercurial for Mozillians The root webview of the Mozilla hg repositories is here: https://hg.mozilla.org/ Most releng code lives in repos under https://hg.mozilla.org/build There are 3 levels of commit access: Level 1 access allows you to use the Try Server and setup user repos. As a new contributor, you should request this on day one. Level 2 access is required to land code in the build and project repos. Once you have a proven track record of successful patches, you can ask your manager/mentor to vouch for your Level 2 access. Your manager/mentor can also land patches for you until you receive Level 2 access. Level 3 access is required to land code directly on mozilla-central and its derived release branches. At some point in your Mozilla contribution story, you may need Level 3 access but many contributors never do. Talk to your manager/mentor if you think you need this access. You should already have Level 2 access when you request Level 3. You need to file an IT bug to get hg commit access. Follow the instructions for Becoming a Mozilla Committer, and for Level 2, specify you need access to (at least) hg.mozilla.org/build/* (Product/Component: mozilla.org/Repository Account Requests). example request: bug 703351 Git & Github There are git mirrors of many popular Mozilla repositories. One of the Mozilla github admins (catlee, coop) can add you to the following GitHub groups: Mozilla-Releng organization Releng team within the Mozilla organization There are also a handful of git repos hosted directly by Mozilla. Your manager/mentor will let you know if you need access to one of these. (See also) PGP PGP keys are used for encrypting sensitive data - you are responsible for generating and managing you own keys. A quick, Mac-focused primer is available on the intranet or you can use the The GNU Privacy Handbook for reference. After you have created your keys, do try to get your key signed by other team members, and uploaded to gpg.mozilla.org. It is okay to reuse an existing gpg key, provided you add an additional ID for your canonical LDAP name (e.g. 'hwine [at] mozilla.com', not an alias like 'Hal_9001 [at] mozilla.com'). Other Services For access to other services, you'll need file a couple of bugs: Access to Nagios File a bug in bugzilla under 'MOC: Service Requests' Access to inventory File a bug under 'Infrastructure & Operations::WebOps: Inventory' Communication IRC The majority of day-to-day communication in releng happens on IRC: https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC irc://irc.mozilla.org irc.mozilla.org:6697 #mozbuild (use SSL, ask for the channel key; your nick needs to be registered) private team channel  * /attach ircs://irc.mozilla.org:6697/?pass=[your_irc_pass]
 * /join #mozbuild [access_key] irc.mozilla.org #releng public channel for discussion with sherrifs, and continuous integration bot keywords to hilite on: "!squirrel" is "I need eyes on this now" keyword in #mozbuild & #releng- please set your client to alert on it. "r?" - team member looking for a review, perhaps not in but (irc/pastebin) also useful to join #developers, #airmozilla, #sf, #mobile, #planning, #release-drivers, #ateam, #infra #sysadmins access_key is here https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SYSADMIN/IRC+use+within+IT #moco [access_key is here [n]] #firebot for hiliting when you're mentioned in a bug, review request, etc. http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/faq/#connect Many folks run a BNC (an IRC bouncer) (e.g. znc) and/or irssi under screen to get continuous view of traffic. Ask around. (some good irssi notes) See below for a local pastebin install, so you don't paste huge amounts in channel. IT now also provides a hosted IRCCloud cloud instance you can partake of. NOTE: if you're using IRCCloud, and are invited to a password protected channel, IRCCloud will not have the password available to re-connect you. Do the following as soon as you enter the channel: Click the "Options" button Copy the password Click the "Leave" button Click the "Rejoin" button Paste the password into the text box. Wiki If you're reading this now, you found the wiki! ;) Please add yourself and details to the list of team members. Don't be shy about making improvements to releng pages based on your experiences. Getting someone in releng to review your changes first is good practice. Just ask in #releng. Useful templates (aka "macros") for releng, use bug 999 for bugzilla references; 6e453b4f7056 for hg revisions is also quite nice. Pastebin There's a local pastebin instance at http://pastebin.mozilla.org/, so you don't need to paste multi-lines into a channel. You'll find a helper script in the braindump repo at utils/pastebin. it creates a new page from stdin, and outputs the url to stdout an argument will be interpretted as the syntax highlighting format to use sample usage: hg diff | pastebin python | pbcopy (last part mac specific) set & export PASTEBIN_NAME if you don't want to post as anonymous. (Many folks now use the pastebin integrated into IRCCloud.) Google Drive Google Drive (formerly Google docs) is a preferred way to share things these days. This includes spreadsheets and documents that will change a great deal over time. Google Drive access should be enabled with your email account when you start. If you need access to a particular document, talk to the document owner or your manager/mentor. Mana Some internal Mozilla systems (IT, HR) are documented on mana. File a ServiceNow ticket if you don't have access when you start. Vidyo Services Our primary two way video meeting platform is Vidyo. Basic usage instructions are here. Especially if you are running linux, it is highly recommended that you install the client and make test calls prior to any meeting. Many of our team meetings are held in the ReleaseEngineering room. Pro tip: many folks have found the mobile client useful to have preinstalled as a backup device. If you're going to record a meeting, practice first. (Instructions are linked from mana page.) Ask team members for details on recording in the ReleaseEngineering room.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed I am not a robot: Google swaps text CAPTCHAs for quivery mouse clicks 05 Dec 2014 27 Google, Security threats Post navigation Previous: YouTube learns about integer overflow, Gangnam Style! Next: All PayPal accounts were 1 click away from hijacking by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Remember back in 2013, when Ticketmaster – the world’s largest online ticket retailer – decided to stop torturing people’s eyeballs by making them decipher blobs of melted characters in order to prove that they’re human? Likewise, Google’s now too stabbing a fork into CAPTCHA, the aggravating test that’s supposed to determine if we’re robots or scripts used by spammers or other online misdeed-doers, or if we are instead real, live, warm-blooded simians. CAPTCHA came out of Carnegie Mellon University and stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. The tests are designed to be hard for robots, easy for humans. They typically consist of typing letters and/or digits from a distorted image. Or, as the case may be, messages to go pleasure yourself. Or, then again, mathematical problems that make your brain bleed. Ten years into using CAPTCHA to keep robots from engaging in dirty tricks online, the “supposed to weed out bots” has now turned into “utterly stink at weeding out bots”. That’s because advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in robot creations that are now able to solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text with 99.8% accuracy, according to Google’s recent research. Not that Google’s going to stop testing site visitors to weed out bots, mind you. Rather, as it announced on Wednesday, Google’s going to move away from asking users to read blobby text and type it into a box, as it’s been doing, like this:  And instead will simply ask us, “Are you a robot?” with what it’s calling the “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” API, like so: Asking us to check off a box saying that “I am not a robot” will be an effective way of determining whether or not we’re robots because humans move their cursors in a humanlike way. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the Web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Wired quotes Shet: All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves It's a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot. He said that there are other variables that will help make the determination, but those have to be kept secret, lest botmasters figure out how to work around them and once again learn how to slip past Google’s filters. Google’s been integrating automated bot-detection into its CAPTCHAs since at least 2013. In October 2013, Google revealed that it had developed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA to filter out bots. The backend doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into the box. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we type into the box – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. On Valentine’s Day, Google gave us a taste of what reCAPTCHA can do, presenting us with chocolates and flowers and throbbing hearts – the first two of which were rendered in text that was simple (for humans) to read. It sounds great, but it’s not yet time to kiss the inscrutably distorted CAPTCHA blobs goodbye. Over the past week, Google’s tests on sites that use CAPTCHA have verified most humans, but it still missed quite a few. As Wired reports, about 60% of WordPress users and 80% of users at video game sales site Humble Bundle got past the CAPTCHA with only the simple checkbox. When Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis engine can’t figure out what we are with a mere click, it’s going to back up the test with a pop-up window that will present users with the same old distorted text we’ve been enduring for years. For mobile users, things haven’t gotten quite so simple as a single click. But when they face a CAPTCHA on their mobile phone or tablet, they’ll now have a much easier hurdle to leap: rather than having to type in text, they’ll be asked to select all the images that correspond with a clue image. Like Google says, it’s a lot easier to tap photos of cats or turkeys than to type in a line of text on a phone: And if you’re worried about the privacy implications of Google analyzing where your mouse moves on a page, Shet pointed out that Google will only be tracking your movements over the CAPTCHA widget when it appears on other sites, not on the entire page. This is how he put it to Wired: You don’t have to verify your identity to verify your humanity. Besides, as we’ve noted before, tracking movement is not just a Google thing. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super secret, privacy-sucking vampire sauce. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This is not news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It’s been around almost since the beginning of the web, and the web would be hurting without it, given the things it makes happen. Among the many features of the language are the abilities to track the position of your cursor, track your keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image.

In the era where the mouse is becoming obsolete Google are going to rely on user mouse movements or clicks to define whether a person is human or not. There are some pretty big gaming communities that have been scripting human like mouse behavior for years. It’ll be interesting to see how this progresses.

Too ambiguous for me. I recall getting one of “click all the sandwiches” and after many failures I realized that in the USA a hamburger is called a sandwich. Reply Paul Ducklin says: September 9, 2016 at 5:40 pm I thought a hamburger was called “a hamburger” in the US :-) By definition, of course, even in British English, a hamburger *is* a sandwich. At any rate, there seems to be no suggestion in any of the Oxford lexicons (British or American) that sandwiches can’t be circular. Two pieces of bread with an edible filling in between is all you need to pass the test. I guess the CAPTCHA folks were hoping a robot wouldn’t be able to handle the subtleties… Having said that, if you tried to order a hamburger by asking for “a sandwich” in Maccas, I think you would get, errrrrrrr, either a sandwich, served in the form of a square cut into two triangle, or a word from the security guard (depending on how strongly you argued the case, and whether it was after 1am).

AIS unveils Google Chromecast, challenging TrueVisions | Bangkok Post: business News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More BUSINESS Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive Today's paper DIGITAL VERSION SIGN IN About E-Newspaper Subscribe Report problem Free Trial HOME DELIVERY Business homepage Business news Telecom Finance Tourism & transport Find company & suppliers Exchange rates More World Gold prices IT Auto Property Business > Business News AIS unveils Google Chromecast, challenging TrueVisions 10 Feb 2017 at 04:00 10,526 viewed8 comments NEWSPAPER SECTION: BUSINESS | WRITER: SRISAMORN PHOOSUPHANUSORN AND KOMSAN TORTERMVASANA Packed out as always by bargain-hunting early adopters and hundreds of vendors, Thailand Mobile Expo 2017 runs until Sunday at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center. (Photo by Pawat Laopaisarntaksin - + The battle over the video-on-demand (VOD) market in Thailand is intensifying as Advanced Info Service (AIS) begins to flex its muscles as an important broadcaster of premium content. With rapidly changing viewership behaviour of digital media taking place via smartphones and tablets, the country's largest mobile operator on Thursday debuted what it dubbed Thailand's sole broadcaster of Google Chromecast service. To use a Chromecast device, retailing at 1,490 baht each, users plug it into their TV's HDMI port and connect to their internet network through a laptop, smartphone or tablet to stream their favourite shows through an app onto a big screen. The move by AIS is set to change the landscape of mobile competition, revive Internet Protocol television (IPTV) and pose a new challenge to other video-streaming and cable TV operators. However, the continued presence of piracy will continue to dictate prices in the video-streaming markets of many countries including Thailand, hindering the industry's growth. More importantly, the bandwidth requirements for customers to stream HD video content are a critical challenge to market growth. Google Chromecast, 1,490 baht from AIS, typically costs well under 1,000 baht even at the highest-priced retail shops elsewhere. Suvit Arayavilaipong, AIS's senior vice-president for product management, said the company is concentrating on increasing its original video screening output and adding more premium content to serve the appetite for on-demand video services. AIS gained major ground with the latest signing of an exclusive deal with Google, securing the rights as exclusive distributor of the Google Chromecast dongle, allowing broadcast of every TV show and movie on Google Play accounts. AIS also recently signed agreements with HBO, Fox and the NBA, giving the company the broadcasting rights to movies, sports and programmes from the three, following TrueVisions' failure to renew a content distribution agreement with HBO. "We are determined to be a technological convergence company -- of networks, content and devices -- as we strive to provide modern digital lifestyle products and services to serve users' needs," Mr Suvit said. "We want to differentiate our services from rivals, staying many steps ahead of the competition." AIS has 1.3 million customers signed up to AIS Play, an application service that allows customers to access Hollywood movies and sporting events from company partners via their smartphones. But less than 2% of AIS Play customers pay for the mobile content service, with the vast majority accessing the services for free. AIS has an additional 200,000 customers using AIS Playbox, a set-top box with a built-in WiFi connection that converts a conventional TV to a smart TV via the AIS broadband fibre network. It charges customers fees starting from 599 baht a month for the Playbox service, including fibre-optic home broadband internet and exclusive TV programmes. Mr Suvit said AIS has 300,000 fibre-optic broadband customers, representing 4% of the local home broadband internet market. The company has 41 million mobile subscribers. "We aim to have 2.5 million active users of AIS Playbox and AIS Play, of which 2.1 million will be on the mobile platform," Mr Suvit said. He said AIS does not expect its VOD service to generate revenue in the short term, adding that the shift from voice-based revenue to data-based revenue for mobile operators will take at least one decade. According to Mr Suvit, AIS's VOD service will not directly target pay TV operator TrueVisions, as Thais spend an average of 10 minutes watching video on mobile devices each time they turn on video. "Our content development is aimed at enhancing our customers' mobile experience and differentiating ourselves from the competition," he said. An industry analyst at CIMB Securities Thailand said the development by AIS looks set to put TrueVisions under pressure, now that the speed of both home broadband and mobile internet are no longer a barrier to the growth of video-streaming consumption. TrueVisions also lost some of its most popular programming over the past few years, including the English Premier League and HBO. "To retain its customer base, TrueVisions needs to adjust its monthly service packages to deal with the increasing number of unhappy customers," said the industry analyst, who asked not to be named. True Corporation recently announced a relaunch of its IPTV service in response to AIS's move. True started its IPTV service in 2008. However, the analyst noted that True was unlikely to aggressively promote its IPTV service because such a campaign could hurt TrueVisions' pay TV service.

Works with many third-party devices and services. Regularly expanding support for new features. Fun to use. Solid speaker sound quality. Cons Speaker distorts at highest volumes. No access to email and messages. Bottom Line The Amazon Echo is so much more than a wireless speaker. It's part voice assistant, part home automation hub, and its abilities continue to expand steadily. And it's a blast to use. By Alex Colon, Will Greenwald Amazon released its Echo Bluetooth speaker/smart home hybrid nearly two year ago, and since then both it and the Alexa voice assistant that powers it have taken the world by storm. We've seen new Alexa-powered devices from Amazon, and Alexa is being added to everything from driving assistant apps to smart light switches. The original $179.99 Amazon Echo speaker, however, is still going strong. //Compare Similar Products Compare Google Home   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Amazon Echo Dot   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Amazon Tap   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Invoxia Triby   %displayPrice%%seller% see it As a speaker, The Echo isn't perfect, but it's perfectly functional. But what's more compelling is that Amazon is continually expanding Alexa's abilities with new features being added all the time, both with first-party services as well as third-party "skills." Because Alexa is always getting better, so is the Echo. It's a better product today than it was a couple of years ago, and the same is likely to be true of it next year. And even up against the new Google Assistant-powered Google Home, Alexa remains the voice assistant to beat. As such, the Amazon Echo earns our Editors' Choice. Design The Echo measures 9.25 inches high and 3.27 inches around. It might be a little tall for some bookshelves, though we can imagine it fitting just about anywhere else in your home just fine. It's basically a plain black or white tube that won't clash with your home decor, but it also won't stand out as a design piece. The Google Home, by comparison, is a bit smaller, at 5.62 by 3.79 inches, and more visually interesting, thanks to its gourd-like shape and fabric base with various color options. The lower half of the Echo is covered in tiny circular perforations, with a gray Amazon logo at the very bottom. The top half is completely unadorned, save for the volume ring, which occupies the uppermost half-inch of the device. The ring twists left or right to control volume, though you can also control that by voice or with the optional remote control. View All 11 Photos in Gallery On the very top of the Echo you'll find two buttons: one that turns the microphone off, and a multipurpose Action button. A sleek translucent panel lining the perimeter is a ring that lights up when you're controlling the speaker. It sits right next to an array of seven microphones. One of the coolest parts about the light ring is that when you're talking, the cluster of lights nearest the microphone that picks up your voice will light up, meaning the light typically responds in your direction (though this wasn't always true when we tested in a smaller room with a lot of echo). You don't even notice it at first, but it helps add a human element to the device. You can purchase an optional microphone-equipped remote ($29.99) similar to the one that comes with the Fire TV Stick. It measures 5.5 by 1.5 by 0.5 inches (HWD) and has a rubberized, grippy feel. If you're in a noisy environment, you can hold down the Microphone button at the top of remote and speak to the Echo, rather than shouting across the room. The remote also lets you control volume and playback on any music you're listening to through the Echo companion app with physical buttons. It comes with a magnetic holster that lets you securely attach it wherever you think you'll use it the most. Without the remote, the Echo's built-in microphone works very well for far-field voice recognition, even when music is playing. Setup and App Setting up the Echo is very simple, with instructions spelled out clearly in Amazon's documentation: Plug in the Echo, download the Echo app, and follow the app's instructions from there. The Echo app is available for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. You can also access the app via the Web from a supported browser. You don't actually need your mobile device or computer on-hand for the Echo to connect to the cloud after initial setup; after it's hooked into your Wi-Fi, it's good to go. The app displays a history of all of the questions you ask Alexa, letting you scroll down through weather reports, music, measurement conversions, and anything else you throw at it. You can tap on the results of any request to get more information, like a detailed weather report from AccuWeather or a Bing search for additional answers to your question. It looks and feels similar to the Google Now screen on stock Android phones. Tapping the menu icon on the top left opens the sidebar, which lets you access specific Alexa functions like Music & Books, Shopping & To-do Lists, Timers & Alarms, Smart Home, and Skills (third-party Alexa features you can individually activate). The menu also lets you change Alexa settings and check all Alexa devices currently linked to your account. Alexa command history tracks across all linked devices, including the Echo. Once you're set up, you can start talking to Alexa. It sounds less robotic than Apple's Siri, but nowhere near as fluid and natural as the OS voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Her. You can't change the voice, but it's fairly agreeable. Voice Control The Echo uses on-device keyword spotting to detect a wake word, so as soon as you say "Alexa," or one of three other words you can choose from, the light turns on and the Echo springs into action. Out of the box, voice recognition is pretty fantastic. We didn't have trouble with Alexa misunderstanding anything, and the voice services should get even better over time, as the Echo uses your own voice recordings to improve its results. Or you can do it yourself by using Voice Training in the Echo app. In addition to the commands you learn in the introductory video and Things To Try, Amazon includes a handy, bookmark-size, double-sided list of things you can ask Alexa. The topics range from everything in the app, such as alarms, lists, and music, to facts, weather, and general commands like "Repeat," "Stop," and "Cancel." The app features additional suggestions of voice commands to try, and several new features have been added to the Echo since its launch. Alexa had no trouble telling us the New York weather forecast for the day or weekend, as well for other cities around the world. You don't need to wait for Alexa to catch up either; you can pretty much just say "Alexa, what's the weather?" without skipping a beat. Alexa can also tell you if there are any traffic problems in your commute once you enter your work location in the app, and can bring up sports scores and schedules. Other things Alexa has no trouble with: state capitals, word definitions, holidays, and measurements. All About Alexa Amazon has been steadily upgrading Alexa since the Echo first launched. It's packed with music, smart home, and information features. You can ask simple questions and get answers, like converting fluid ounces to cups. Alexa can set timers and alarms by voice; all you need to do is say, "Alexa, set timer for 60 minutes," or "Alexa, set alarm for 6:40 a.m." You can also ask Alexa to add items to shopping and to-do lists, which are automatically added to the Echo app. Of course, you can also use Alexa to buy products right from Amazon. Google Assistant has the same functionality in this regard, letting you ask for information and perform very simple tasks. Alexa syncs with your Amazon music library and, if you have Amazon Prime, all of Prime Music. You can also play music from iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, and TuneIn, though you need to manually link your accounts to Alexa through the app. You can even have Alexa read you books, either in text-to-speech mode for any Kindle titles you own, or Audible audiobook playback. Google Home only works with Google Play Music, Pandora, Spotify, and oddly enough YouTube. Voice control aside for a moment, the Echo also functions as a typical Bluetooth speaker. The Google Home, on the other hands, lacks Bluetooth. It only works as a Wi-Fi speaker you can cast to like a Google Chromecast Audio, making it a bit less versatile. If you use any home automation devices like smart lights or thermostats, you can likely use the Echo to control them. Alexa supports If This Then That (IFTTT), Belkin WeMo, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, and Wink, to name some of the big ones, with 66 smart home skills from various manufacturers available at the time of writing. If you have a Logitech Harmony Elite, you can even control your home theater through Alexa (not to mention the extensive list of products the Harmony platform can control). Google Home only supports Nest, Philips, and Samsung direct control, though it can also use IFTTT recipes. Alexa supports thousands of third-party skills (voice apps) beyond just smart home support. You can order a pizza from Dominos or coffee (to pick up) from Starbucks, get news directly from the NPR Hourly News Summary, play your favorite podcasts, walk through relaxing breathing exercises, and even get obscure facts about Pokemon. These skills need to be found in the app or on the Web and individually enabled, but the sheer amount and variety is truly impressive, as is the fact that more are being added regularly. This is the biggest advantage the Echo has over Google Home, because anyone can make skills for Alexa, while Google Assistant doesn't have an API for third parties to develop new features for it at all. Google may have come late to the party, but it isn't making it easy for developers to catch up. Alexa isn't quite as smart as Siri when handling personal information. It can tell you what's on your Google Calendar schedule and add events, but it can't read your email or text messages or send any to other people. The Google Home shares these limitations, which is surprising, given that it's a Google product. Audio Performance The Echo doesn't have a built-in battery, so even though it's small, it's not exactly portable. Sure, you can just pull the power adapter out of the wall and plug it in somewhere else, but this, coupled with the optional remote, Amazon is sending a clear message that the Echo is meant to remain stationary. Want a portable, battery-powered version? Get the Amazon Tap. Let's not forget, the Amazon Echo is first and foremost a speaker. And as far as speakers go, it's fine. We tested it side-by-side against the Bose SoundLink Color, an Editors' Choice for midrange Bluetooth speakers. There's no question the SoundLink Color is a better speaker than the Echo, as it provides deep bass without distortion, two things the Echo struggles with. Compared with Google Home, the Echo gets a bit louder, but Google Home produces a slightly richer, fuller sound. On tracks with heavy sub-bass content, like The Knife's "Silent Shout," the Echo lacks any resonant low end, and starts to distort as you approach maximum volume. Dialing back the volume helps cut the distortion, but the Echo still lacks any substantial low end presence. On the positive side, the high end is crisp, and there's just enough bass that music never sounds cold. Most of the tracks we listened to, from Ani DiFranco's acoustic "Garden of Simple" to D'Angelo's jazzy "Ain't That Easy," felt warm, with enough volume to fill a modest-sized room with sound. If you're primarily looking for a speaker, the Echo does a decent job, but for $179.99, it's competing against options with significantly more power and better sound quality, not to mention built-in batteries. And in that case, you're better off with the Ultimate Ears UE Boom 2. Heck, you can even plug it into an Echo Dot for superior audio performance and Alexa. Conclusions If you're just looking for a speaker, chances are you wouldn't have read this far. Sure, there's really nothing you can do with the Amazon Echo that you can't do with the smartphone in your pocket or the smartwatch on your wrist. Yet there's something here that feels infinitely more approachable than a phone or watch. Ultimately, this is a battle of voice assistants far more than it is of hardware. The Google Home has a different look and a slightly warmer sound signature that might appeal to you, but Google Assistant just can't compete with Alexa's superior library of skills. If you don't love the look or sound of the Echo, there are plenty of Alexa-powered alternatives coming down the pike (and they're not all speakers). But we like the way it looks and sounds, and coupled with the steady flow of updates that Amazon keeps pushing out, the Echo has become a far better device today than we ever would have imagined two years ago.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Windows 10 Cloud Leak Points to Potential Chrome OS Fighter TiVo's Analytics Pinpoint Highlights of Super Bowl LI EU Certifies Google Data Transfer Contracts Comply With Privacy Rules Evernote Makes Notetaking Frictionless in iOS App Revamp       Today's topics include the leak of Windows 10 Cloud, TiVo’s analysis of which Super Bowl LI ads performed the best, the European Union’s confirmation that Google’s international data transfer contract clauses are compliant with data protection requirements and the latest version of Evernote for iOS has new content capture functionality. Chromebooks, inexpensive notebook PCs powered by Google's Chrome OS, are becoming an increasingly common sight, particularly in schools. A Web leak that made the rounds this past weekend suggests that partnering on inexpensive Windows 10 PCs for classrooms isn't the only way Microsoft plans to compete for budget-conscious technology buyers. Windows 10 Cloud, a version of Microsoft's flagship operating system that only runs Universal Windows Platform apps, was leaked onto the internet by Twitter user ad guard, reported MSPoweruser on Feb. 3. Screenshots of the new OS bear a striking resemblance to Windows 10, down to the task bar and integrated Cortana-enabled search field. When attempting to install Win32 applications, however, a dialog box appears notifying users that this version of the Windows 10 OS "was made to help protect you and your device by exclusively running Windows Store apps." TiVo watched Super Bowl LI along with much of the rest of the world on Feb. 5. Then, after spending the entire evening evaluating the data, data scientists at the company on Feb. 6 unveiled their post-game report on the telecast. The report highlighted this year's most engaging commercials, promotions and in-game moments. TiVo uses anonymous viewership information from millions of set-top boxes in the U.S. for data-driven viewership prediction and audience targeting. The top three spots were Bai Brands “BaiBaiBai” spot featuring Justin Timberlake and Christopher Walken, Kia’s “Hero’s Journey” and It’s a 10 Haircare’s self-titled ad. The contractual clauses that Google uses to cover international data transfers for European customers of its G Suite applications and its cloud services have been certified as being compliant with European Union data protection requirements. EU data protection authorities have confirmed that the language in Google's contracts for EU business customers align with the European Commission's so-called "model contract clauses," the company said Monday. The certification gives EU businesses the legal protections needed for international data transfers without further authorizations, the two executives said. The compliance certification will also make it easier for Google to get similar certifications in other countries that have data protection requirements similar to those in the EU. The latest of version of Evernote for iOS not only looks different, it streamlines many of the popular app's note taking and content capture functionality. "All of the main things that you want to do in the application are just a touch away," Nate Fortin, vice president of Design at Evernote, told eWEEK during an interview. Crafting an interface and overall experience that got out of the user's way was the central philosophy guiding the company's efforts in the months before the Jan. 17 of the redesigned app, he added. Evernote 8.0 for iPhones, iPad and iPod Touch sports a minimalist, uncluttered start-up that showcases a user's notes and provides quick access to notebooks and the app's search functionality.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Rest assured, however, that Google is working on adding these features to the Android emulator soon. Google is also changing the app review process for Android Wear: First, enhancing your phone app notifications for Android Wear will no longer be sufficient for passing the review. Second, it will soon be required that you upload a watch APK that’s compatible with Android Wear 2.0. Only apps that pass these criteria will receive badging in Play Store on the phone and be eligible for top charts for Android Wear apps. You can learn more about the new SDK over at the Android Developers website.

Copy Link You might not be able to soak up the local culture (or even blink) but this time-lapse video of Google Maps images can take you on a global tour in a really big hurry. The creator of this clever film, Matteo Archonids, linked Google Maps screenshots ranging from stratospheric to street-level in a fluid enough fashion that you can experience international travel the same way Superman might.  He used Google’s developer tools to streamline the images that he captured, one-by-one, sequentially, an effort that consumed two full days. Archondis said he was able to use Google’s open software to clean up the images later for a better user experience that wasn’t cluttered with widgets and icons. I was able to remove all the items that interfered with the user experience. I also removed the labels so that the final image could be as clean and realistic as possible so that I could concentrate on the camera movements as if it was in real life,” he explained. He then laid them out like this:  Peta Pixel To create the impressive video:  The hard part was stabilizing and creating a central focal point for the viewer amid all the chaos of changing images.

report this ad / Rob Beschizza / 1:55 pm Thu Feb 9, 2017 Review: Lenovo Yoga Book From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Lenovo's Yoga Book is the most striking personal computer I've seen in years. More than the original iPhone, or Sony's X505, or the Messagepad, here's technology that seems a few years ahead of schedule. It's compact, attractive and thinner than anything else that might be called a laptop. Imagine two hinged pieces of black glass, one of which glows with the internet and the other with Okudagrams, and you have the Yoga Book. report this ad Inside is an Intel Atom x5 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space. There's a 10" 1920x1200 touchscreen, a micro-USB port, a mini-HDMI port and a real, honest-to-God headphone jack. It runs Windows or Android, and I tested it with the latter. The keyboard is a completely flat, featureless panel that doubles as a trackpad and Wacom-style graphics tablet. The layout lights up on it, then turns off when it's being used with the pen. It's pretty and minimalist, every key's outline an etched white line. This uncompromising design comes at the cost of performance, which aligns with Chromebooks more than "proper" laptops: this thing would get its ass kicked by a Surface Pro. But then again, it's less than half the price of one. In fact, at $500, it feels surprisingly inexpensive, especially given the premium materials and workmanship. This puts you in the right frame of mind: the Yoga Book is a sleek tablet with business benefits, not a business-class laptop. That said, using the standard Google apps and a few downloaded from the Google Play store, I ran into no significant performance issues. Browsing, typing, mailing, editing (where work didn't involve graphics or video editing) went without a hitch or jag. The Yoga Book passes the "road warriors and grandmothers" threshhold of utility. Serious desktop apps on the Windows model may be another matter. I'd opt for the Windows model rather than the Android one, though, even being $50 more expensive. Google's mobile operating system just doesn't quite feel right on a quasi-laptop device like this. Multitasking, on-screen keyboards showing up here and there, and various other mobile-device shibboleths constantly got in the way of my expectations. Lenovo is readying a Chrome OS edition, which will surely be a better fit for those wanting to avoid Windows. The best thing about the Yoga Book is the way the device integrates with the magnetic leatherette notepad that comes with it. This contains a dotted paper pad ($20 refills!) and a stylus/pen with interchangeable ballpoint ink tips. In other words, you can simultaneously create physical and digital notes—and art!—simply by placing paper over the keyboard panel and getting to work. You can even close the machine inside-out, turning it into a fancy-looking notepad that's silently digitizing everything you do. People in meetings wouldn't even know it was a gadget, recording not only your scrawled notes but everything they're saying, for later. I found it surprisingly pleasant to use for drawing and painting, too. It comes with Artrage and has good pressure sensitivity and acceptable latency. In fact, I really liked painting with it: the panel has a texture oddly akin to high-quality paper. Not rough, but with a bit of tooth, much nicer than smooth glass. You can't draw on the actual display, though, so the reference point for artists is still "Wacom Bamboo" rather than a Cintiq or iPad Pro. The keyboard, though, is what brought me to a halt. There's no mechanical aspect to it at all, no tactility, no feedback. Typing on it is exactly like typing on a tablet's screen, albeit with a more complete and traditionally-spaced layout. If you like screen-typing, don't need a pro laptop and have $500 in your wallet, the Yoga Book is something you can fall in love with. But for me, this one irreducible aspect of it, key to the whole device's clever spread of uses, means that I just couldn't get any work done.

How To Make The Most Of Valentine’s Day With Android For Couples Pixel’s Google Assistant Gains Home Control Support February 9, 2017 - Written By Daniel Fuller Google Assistant differs a good bit between Google Home and smartphones like the Google Pixel, although ‘Home Control‘ functionality for the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL seeks to bridge that gap by allowing your phone to act as your home IoT hub. Home Control brings the ability to link up to supported smart devices in your home, just like Google Home can, and issue them commands via Google Assistant. For now, the list of supported brands is limited to Honeywell, Nest, Philips Hue, SmartThings, and WeMo, though you may be able to control more devices via the Join app, which can integrate Assistant with IFTTT and Tasker. There is no word at the moment on what the requirements are for the update, but it does seem as though Pixels running Android 7.1.2 (Nougat), are starting to see the functionality show up in the Google app. The function allows users to set up devices and rooms to control by name with voice commands, again mirroring the functionality of Google Home. Users can set up voice commands for certain clusters of devices, such as turning on the lights in the main corridor or starting up music in the kitchen. While this does not entirely eliminate the need to buy a Google Home, it can patch up coverage for those with large homes where a Google Home unit can’t hear throughout, and can serve as a basic IoT hub for those without a Google Home. While the implementation is rudimentary compared to Google Home at this point, Assistant’s contextual command function and the option to integrate with Tasker and IFTTT can make Home Control on the Pixel quite capable. Commands such as “turn on the hall lights”, followed by “turn on the music, too” could theoretically be created, as they could with Google Home. This feature has so far only been reported on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, but may well appear on other phones that feature Assistant, both officially and unofficially, in the near future. In the meantime, if you own a Pixel or Pixel XL and would like to check out the new functionality, head to the Google app settings, then to the Google Assistant settings and you should see the ‘Home control’ tab listed, as shown below.

With Google’s rollout of a browser with native WebVR support, VR users will now be able to load VR experiences directly in their Chrome browser on their Daydream-ready phones without having to first download a VR app. Over time WebVR is expected to take hold and proliferate across devices and platforms. Given the maturity and ubiquity of web technology, the expansion of WebVR should also mean accelerated adoption of VR technology. Matterport is one of the launch partners to work with Google in rolling out a WebVR experience which has been released with Chrome 56 as an origin trial. “At Matterport, we want to make it very easy for our customers to create VR content, for our partners to distribute this VR content and for users to consume VR content,” said Bill Brown, CEO of Matterport. “WebVR support helps to make VR simple, immediate and accessible.” With WebVR, users no longer need to download any apps to move from a web experience to a VR experience. For those with a Daydream-ready phone, experiencing VR means they simply tap the VR icon in a Matterport 3D Showcase in their Chrome browser, slip their phone into a Daydream View, and start exploring. “WebVR makes discovering virtual reality experiences as easy as clicking a link,” said Megan Lindsay, Google Product Manager for WebVR. “Matterport’s WebVR integration lets Daydream users with Chrome explore places all over the world from anywhere.” Matterport made waves last year when it announced CoreVR, allowing customers to automatically enable any of its 3D tours to be experienced in VR. This move gave Matterport the distinction of having by far the largest VR library of real-world spaces. Customers such as Sotheby’s International Realty, who have been using Matterport, are seeing the benefits of WebVR. “WebVR will become a catalyst for VR content, and Google’s Chrome is the first to support WebVR natively in a production version,” said John Passerini, Global VP Interactive Marketing at Sotheby's International Realty. “By enabling Sotheby's International Realty listings in WebVR using Matterport’s technology, we will continue to stay at the forefront of cutting edge technology.” Customers like Mansion Global, a luxury real estate portal and publisher, see the benefits of this roll out. “WebVR will bring the power of the linked web to VR content,” said Mae Cheng, Publisher and Editor-in-Chief at Mansion Global. “Mansion Global wants to make it easy for readers to experience listings first-hand, and the combination of WebVR and Matterport goes a long way to doing that. We are excited to offer Matterport WebVR on our site to prospective property buyers and readers.” To view Matterport VR Spaces with WebVR, you need: A Daydream-ready phone with the latest version of Chrome. See compatible phones on Google’s Daydream website. A Daydream View VR headset by Google. Learn more and purchase on Google’s Daydream website. Support for additional browsers and platforms will be added soon. Further details on Google's announcement are available here. Further details on experiencing Matterport VR are available here.

This is enabled with Google Assistant and Google Assistant’s command of “Home Control” connectivity. Users will be able to connect to devices from five brands (so far), including Honeywell, Nest, Philips Hue, SmartThings, and WeMo. This new controller can be found by saying “OK Google” to the Google Pixel or Pixel XL with the newest version of the Google App and Play Services. Once Google Assistant is actively listening, the upper right-hand corner should have a set of three dots, leading to the menu of Google Assistant settings. In this menu, users will find a new item in the “Pixel” category, “Home Control”, alongside News, My Day, and Shopping List. Inside the settings for Home Control, users can Add Devices and Add Rooms. Inside Devices, the brands listed above can be found, and through each brand a link to that brand’s user login page can be accessed. If the user logs into Philips Hue, they’ll be asked to log in to their account, then the device will attempt to connect to the Hue Bridge. This process is slightly different for each brand, as each brand has its own connecting central device. Connecting to a Room allows the user to see a set of smart devices in self-made folders. Pre-made folder titles the user can choose from include Attic, Backyard, Basement, Bathroom, Bedroom, Deck, Den, Dining Room, Downstairs, Driveway, Entryway, Family Room, Front Yard, Garage, Guest House, Guest Room, Hallway, Kitchen, Living Room, Master Bedroom, Office, outside, Patio, Shed, and Upstairs. The user also has the ability to add their own custom-titled room. As each room can be custom-titled, it’ll be interesting to see how Google Assistant handles users giving their rooms really strange names. The same goes for devices, though a little less so since they’ve already got names that are perfectly generous, like Lamp. Expect this update to arrive on your Pixel within the next few days. Then expect NVIDIA to come with an update not long after that, if you’re lucky.

The Frenchman was to oversee a collaboration with Stanford University on a seemingly preposterous new project. Vincent initially toiled on the task during his 20% time — Google’s famous system that allows employees to work on side projects — but the effort soon occupied more than just 20% of his time and turned into one of Google’s most famous products: Google Street View. “That was a fun time at Google. We were small, probably about the same size as Lyft today,” Vincent told Business Insider. After 12 years at the search giant, Vincent has left the company and joined ride-hailing company Lyft as its VP of Engineering, having started on Monday. He will oversee the marketplace and mapping teams and report to Lyft’s VP of Engineering, Peter Morelli. His experience in mapping — and its crucial function to ride-hailing apps — is a big boost to Lyft, which hasn’t invested as heavily as its competitor Uber in building out its own systems. While at Google, Vincent oversaw everything from how to strap cameras onto backpacks to putting the cameras on satellites in order to map the world. While Lyft doesn’t have plans to introduce mapping cars (or satellites for that matter) anytime soon, Vincent said even things like knowing which way the car is facing on the map for effective routes are mapping and marketplace challenges. And while he’s excited to bring his decade plus experience at one of the top mapping teams in the globe to Lyft, working for a company that’s looking to transform the globe in a new way appealed to Vincent the most. “I like the fact that it’s not only a great business, but something that will do good for the world,” Vincent said. “If we are smart about it, through the kind of services that Lyft can provide, I think we can help people’s lives really broadly.” NOW WATCH: Here’s how the top Silicon Valley companies are responding to Trump’s immigration ban Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

Name: Subject: Message: Latest Chrome release supports mobile VR sites with Daydream View phones Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham1 day ago 1 137 9 Normally, accessing virtual reality content with a smartphone requires the use of special apps. Now, the latest stable release of the Chrome web browser for Android and PC will open up the VR experience, as it adds support for the WebVR developer tools. Sites that support WebVR can now be viewed within the Chrome browser to get a more immersive experience. See also: Google Daydream – everything you need to know You can go ahead and view that content on your phone with Chrome, but in order to get the full VR experience, you can also use the Daydream View headset while running the browser, if your phone is one of the few that currently supports the Daydream platform. Google says it will be adding more VR headset support to the Chrome browser in the future, including its own bare-bones Cardboard platform. The blog post from Google also offers a bunch of sites that Chrome Android users can access right now with the new WebVR support. They include Sketchfab, which has over 1 million 360 degree images and movies showing a wide variety of themes and topics. There’s also PlayCanvas’ WebVR Lab site, which lets you have some interesting interactive VR experiences, including a way to play a record with a Daydream View controller. It’s not all fun and games, though. In a separate blog post, Google talks about Bear 71 VR, a virtual reality documentary that centers on the title character, a female Grizzly Bear who roams in Banff National Park in Canada. The bear was collared and tracked, and the film shows how she tries to deal with her natural habitat being visited more often by humans. While originally made for Flash-based sites, the creators of Bear 71 revamped it for WebVR so it could be seen in Chrome and Daydream View headsets. The movie is now live on Google’s web showcase developer site. Do you think adding WebVR support in Chrome will make virtual reality more accessible to smartphones in the future?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Preparing to Purge Thousands of 'Zombie' Apps Don Reisinger Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)February 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share There's a good chance that the Google Play marketplace will soon have fewer apps — and that's by Google's design. Google has been sending notices to developers around the world telling them that if they don't clean up their apps, their programs could wind up removed from the Google Play marketplace, according to The Next Web, which obtained a copy of the email. The notice from Google accuses app developers of being in violation of the company's User Data policy and requests that they have a "valid privacy policy" if their app "requests or handles sensitive user or device information." Google wants developers to add the privacy policy to their apps by March 15 or else. "Administrative action will be taken to limit the visibility of your app, up to and including removable from the Play Store," the company wrote in its notice to developers. MORE: Best Android Apps You're Not Using The move is likely part of a broader push by Google to clean up its Play Store. The marketplace has grown in leaps and bounds and now has more than 2 million mobile apps available to Android users. However, it's also overrun with so-called Zombie Apps that haven't been looked after, improved or updated in years. They pose potential security risks and ultimately degrade the Android user experience. By requiring developers to update privacy policies within the next month, Google is effectively determining which developers are still engaged with their apps and which are not. And any that fall in the latter category will likely have their programs removed. The policy has another potential benefit for Android users: it should make it easier for legitimate apps to surface on Google Play. For its part, Google hasn't commented on the apparent decision to limit zombie apps and likely won't. But it's part of a broader attempt by both Google and Apple, which operates its own App Store, to judge their marketplaces not by the number of apps, as they once did, but rather the quality of the programs they have.

Ms Harrison released images late on Thursday afternoon that appear to be screen shots of two emails.

More videos Seven clears CEO of wrongdoing Seven West Media clears CEO Tim Worner of wrongdoing after allegations of misconduct were raised last year by former employee Amber Harrison. Earlier this week she responded to the board's conclusion that Mr Worner has done nothing wrong following an independent investigation into his conduct and credit card spending. On Tuesday she tweeted love letters she received from him and receipts that she says contradict the board's finding. The latest online spray demonstrates Ms Harrison still holds a cache of sensitive company information and is releasing it selectively. It also sheds light on the network's dealings with the Corby family ahead of the release of Schapelle Corby from Kerobokan prison, where she served nine years for drug smuggling.

It reads "We got Mercedes' signature late last night. So very close". Mercedes Corby was deeply involved in her sister's media negotiations. The email does not say what the signature was for. It was sent on February 8, 2014, two days before Schapelle Corby left jail. Advertisement Is my case the first cover up Seven West Media has been involved in?

The court case also heard New Idea, published by Seven subsidiary Pacific Magazines, sent Mercedes Corby a letter that referred to a $25,000 payment.

Is my case the first cover up Seven West Media has been involved in? pic.twitter.com/CD9qfCG8NJ— Amber Harrison (@_Amber_Harrison) February 9, 2017 After the raid Seven sued the AFP and successfully had the search warrants quashed. It also got a public apology from the AFP for "unnecessary reputational damage". Seven has always denied there was any payment for the Sunday Night story or that any payment was made. A company spokesman on Thursday night said: "those emails relate to the AFP matter which was settled successfully in court and successfully gained an apology from the AFP". Ms Harrison is continuing her campaign against Seven out of frustration that Mr Worner has been forgiven for his behaviour, while the company pursues her over alleged credit card fraud. Seven commissioned Deloitte to investigate her credit card spending after she revealed the affair. Deloitte found she had allegedly misspent $186,000 of company money. Ms Harrison says she can prove all but $14,000 were legitimate work expenses, but has never been given the opportunity. "[These emails] speak to the character of the people in charge of the company who waged a legal war on me. [Board member] Jeff Kennett is right - it is an issue of character," she said, referring to a twitter war this week between herself and Mr Kennett over corporate governance.

More videos Apple appeals EU tax ruling Apple has launched a legal challenge to a record $US14 billion EU tax demand, arguing that EU regulators ignored tax experts and corporate law, and deliberately picked a method to maximise the penalty. Recall that in August Apple was ordered by repay €13 billion in taxes and interest after European Commission found the software giant's Irish tax structure was "illegal under EU state aid rules".  This week Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician, who is currently serving as the European Commissioner for Competition and took on the Apple case last year, said that regardless of what Trump does ("whatever US tax reform they may pass is, of course, for them") the ruling stands. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US President Donald Trump would give multinationals a special tax break if they brought profits to be taxed back to the US. Photo: Bloomberg "What is important for us is ... if any company or group of companies gets selective advantages by member states and thereby unlevelling (sic) the playing field." But what if other countries might want a share of the tax owed? Advertisement As Vestager noted a her statement after the decision last year: "It may be that not all the unpaid taxes are due in Ireland. Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation." She continues: "If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, says the ruling against Apple stands. Photo: AP This leads to Trump's tax plan. He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  Photo: AP   "Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated," the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings. Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion. ITEP report Ordinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe. No wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  But it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday. The ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore – Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America. The report suggests  that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate. "In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion," it says. Rather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings. Meanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures. Apple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures. According to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016. Its profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years.  The tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

How To Make The Most Of Valentine’s Day With Android For Couples Google Details Android Wear 2.0 Benefits & Releases Final SDK February 9, 2017 - Written By Daniel Fuller Android Wear 2.0 is here, and Google has taken to the Google Developers blog to go over the improvements it brings with a fine tooth comb, and what those improvements mean for developers. On the whole, things have gotten easier and prettier for both developers and users, and new hardware features are supported, allowing for a wider range of watch designs and form factors. The list of changes for the new version of Android Wear is massive, and some of them fundamentally alter the way Android Wear smartwatches work, making them fully competitive with the likes of the Samsung Gear S3 and the Apple Watch. Changes like Android Wear finally adopting Material Design, getting independent internet access, and getting Play Store functionality make this update a game-changer for users and developers alike, and there are tons of other under the hood changes that open up new worlds of possibility. For starters, one of the biggest changes is independent cloud and web access. Android Wear apps can now send and receive data without having to use a phone as a middleman, meaning that Wi-Fi and cellular-enabled Android Wear devices could feasibly become a user’s sole device for everything except media consumption and gaming. Hand in hand with that big addition to the ecosystem, Android Wear watches can now access the Play Store, allowing them to download compatible apps without having to sync them up through a phone. While some apps still require a companion component on a linked phone to set them up properly, many will either already be fully usable on the watch alone when run on an updated device, or will implement such functionality in the future. Finally, Android Wear has fully adopted Material Design guidelines with a darker look, more vertical task trees, and richer animations. Aside from those three overall game changers, there are some fairly big changes in the update. Complications, things on the watch face that display anything besides the time, can now link to third party apps with a special Complications API from Google, rather than the developer of a watch face having to strike a deal with an app developer whose app they want to integrate, and then both parties coding in that integration by hand. Physical button location changing and rotary dial gestures are now supported, allowing manufacturers to play around more with device design. LG’s upcoming watches are among the first to boast this functionality. Apps will also undergo a more thorough vetting process before receiving the Wear-compatible badge and being eligible for top chart placement in the Android Wear apps category; apps will have to include a separate APK made especially for Android Wear, rather than simply tweaking their usual notifications to be Wear-friendly. Google’s new Android Wear 2.0 SDK includes support and tools to make implementing all of these changes as easy as possible for developers.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google launches Daydream VR in Chrome for Android Chris Burns - Feb 9, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit This week the folks at Google have launched the latest version of Chrome for Android devices, this one ready to roll with Daydream VR. Users of Daydream-ready devices will be able to visit and experience a number of Daydream-formatted webpages that allow a virtual reality experience to be viewed directly through the Chrome web browser. In the past, there were rumblings about WebVR for multiple sorts of virtual reality devices – for now, there is only talk of Daydream.* WebVR is a JavaScript API introduced to Google’s web browser for Android to enable the viewing of specially-formatted VR experiences. This script allows the web browser to connect with the smartphone’s sensors. With access to these sensors, the web browser is able to move the image shown and adjust the sound heard according to the direction the smartphone is aimed. SEE TOO: Daydream View Review This system allows the smartphone – in this case – to be utilized with a Daydream headset. That’s the newest version of Google’s virtual reality experience for mobile devices. This is just the beginning for Google for this type of experience. They plan on expanding in a big way in the future. *Google suggests that they’ll be adding support for other headsets for WebVR in the future. This includes WebVR support for Chrome on the PC for desktop VR headsets like HTC VIVE and Oculus Rift. This also includes the simplest of mobile VR headsets, like Google Cardboard. The one VR experience we recommend you try first is the Sketchfab VR showcase. In this showcase is a wide variety of 3D-rendered scenes that’ll be able to be explored with a Daydream VR headset. It’s a wild experience, to be sure. Other experiences are available, the first set of which is listed by Google in their Product Blog. Users will be able to find the newest version of the Chrome web browser in the Google Play app store. The newest version of Chrome – with access to webVR for Daydream – will be available immediately if not soon.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Want to run your own Amazon 'region'? Stratoscale shows you how Nasuni CEO: ‘We’re going to liberate you from the bottleneck around your files’ IT teams put conversations to work with ChatOps Video Mingis on Tech: Hot tech skills 2017 Once upon a time, Silicon Valley’s top tech companies agreed not to poach employees from one another. In 2005, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs famously warned Google’s cofounder Sergey Brin, “If you hire a single one of these people, that means war.” Of course, that’s not the case now. (In fact, in 2015 Apple, Google, Adobe, Intel and others paid a $415 million settlement to engineers whose pay had been held down due to illegal anti-poaching arrangements.) In today’s job market, the best way to find talent is to take it from your competitors. Recruiting company Talentful recently published a new report exposing where tech’s top companies find their talent. Google, for example, hires most heavily from Microsoft and IBM. Facebook draws significant talent from Google, while Microsoft poaches from IBM and Amazon. Though there’s a lot of trading back and forth, some of the companies have taken more employees than they’ve had poached from them: 12,798 of Google’s employees came from other major tech companies. While Google has taken 4,151 of Microsoft’s staff, Microsoft has taken 896 in exchange. Amazon has swapped a few workers with eBay, giving up 152 employees and taking 218. Apple has poached more employees from Microsoft than anywhere else: 1,334 in total. They’re also keen on people from IBM and Intel. While IBM has taken more staff in total than Dell, they’re vulnerable to their rival's headhunting, having lost 2,302 of their employees to them, while taking 1,753. “There’s a huge amount of staff trading between companies,” a Talentful rep said. “And every time one company hires a staff member from another, they’re not just bringing in that person -- they’re bringing in their whole network. People like to work with familiar teams who know the way they work, and they end up bringing their colleagues with them.” But company politics, counteroffers and high emotions can complicate leaving an employer for a competitor. Stephany Samuels, senior VP of people strategy and IT recruiting company Mondo, offers some tips to help you make a graceful exit. Do resign in person. Although you may be ready to move on quickly, it’s courteous to have a conversation face-to-face instead of over the phone or via email, if possible, she says. Don’t bad-mouth the company you’re leaving. “While it might not have been the right place for you anymore, don’t paint a bad picture of the company. It can brew insecurity among your coworkers,” Samuels says. Do leave your manager ample time to replace you before you move on. “If they’ve treated you well, take that into account and give them the notice they’ll need to replace you -- or at least offset your workload while they find a replacement,” she says. Don’t burn bridges. “At the end of the day, it’s about your success and all of the hard work that brought you there,” Samuels says. “Offending employers or peers when leaving could come back to haunt you. We all know that networks are smaller than they feel.” Do participate in an exit interview with HR, Samuels says. “Companies appreciate candid and constructive feedback so they can improve and better engage and retain their current employees.” To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

 Google is reportedly providing funding to fight Trump's immigration ban Sam Shead Feb. 7, 2017, 7:12 AM 1,511 facebook linkedin twitter email print Larry Page, cofounder of Google and CEO of Alphabet.REUTERS/Steve Marcus Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla, and around 100 other companies signed legal documents on Monday opposing President Donald Trump's immigration ban. But Bloomberg reports that there's one tech giant in particular that has taken the lead in co-ordinating the funding for the amicus brief — a legal document signed by parties that have an interest in a case but are not a part of the litigation. Alphabet, Google's parent company, is spearheading the funding efforts, according to Bloomberg sources who claim to have knowledge of the arrangement. The Mountain View firm is reportedly working with Washington D.C. law firm Mayer Brown on the amicus brief. Other firms have reportedly offered to chip in on the legal costs and Alphabet plans to accept their offers, sources told Bloomberg. Trump's executive order on immigration bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for at least 90 days. The countries affected are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. A federal judge issued a temporary nationwide hold on the ban Friday night. Google has set up a $4 million (£3 million) fund of its own to support its immigrant employees around the world. The search-engine giant is pledging $2 million (£1.6 million) of its own money, while the remaining $2 million (£1.6 million) is expected to be made up in donations from Googlers. "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US," Google said in a statement seen by USA Today. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." The executive order affects at least 187 Google employees, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Alphabet reportedly declined to comment on the Bloomberg story and did not immediately respond to Business Insider.

The ride-hail company poached Luc Vincent, known as the founder of Google’s Street View team, to be its newest vice president of engineering. Vincent, who was at Google for 12 years, will be leading the company’s mapping and marketplace teams and will report to Peter Morelli, whose title is also vice president of engineering. Vincent’s initial focus will be on improving the real-time mapping information on the Lyft app, Vincent told Recode, but he said he sees himself eventually contributing to the company’s autonomous efforts. High-definition maps are a crucial aspect of any autonomous system and make it possible for the vehicle to navigate and drive itself. The Google veteran will also be working on improving the efficiency of the algorithms that determine rider and driver matching as well as routing — both features that depend heavily on real-time mapping information. Lyft expects to continue to see incredible growth in terms of its physical footprint and the size of its staff. The company, which recently expanded into 40 new cities in the U.S., has gotten three times bigger in terms of its personnel in 2016. In his first year, Vincent expects to continue that trend and significantly scale up the company’s engineering team. Vincent’s hire comes at a critical time for Lyft. In the wake of sweeping calls to delete Uber for what some perceived as the company’s attempt to profit off the backs of protesting taxi drivers, the ride-hail company saw an influx of new users. Lyft wouldn’t disclose any numbers, but the app soared to the top 10 most-downloaded apps in the app store last week, beating Uber for the first time. For further context, sources say there were upward of 200,000 Uber accounts deleted last week — though the company saw almost as many new accounts added. While it’s certainly a boon for the younger ride-hail player, the challenge for Lyft is to retain those riders. Improving the efficiency of its maps, routing and matching are all means to enhance that rider experience and maintain its new wave of users. Lyft isn’t alone in scouring Google Maps for a head of its rider and driver marketplace. In 2015, Uber hired Daniel Graf — he was the senior director of Google Maps from 2012 to 2014 — to lead its marketplace team.

BRIEF: Spotify Promotes Katy Perry • Beats Now Come w/ 3 Months Apple Music • Pandora Stumbles • More » Department Of Justice Should Drop 100% Licensing Push A hotly contested and lawsuit-inducing issue from the start, the time has come for the Department Of Justice to ditch its push for a 100% licensing rule on songwriters particularly since most of the lawyers working on the issue have since abandoned it. _______________________________ Guest post from David Lowery of The Trichordist Now that most of the DOJ lawyers who pushed the 100% licensing rule on songwriters are gone, who’s gonna deal with all those feral cats that former Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse was feeding?  Last year, in what can only be described as an elaborate Kabuki, a small group of DOJ lawyers led by a former Google attorney, took up a question that no one except Google was asking:  Do the DOJ consent decrees that govern songwriter public performance licenses require a songwriter to license 100% of the song or does each songwriter “fractionally” license their own share? (How 100% licensing benefits Google) The simple and obvious answer is, no.   For 70+ years songwriters have been governed by these same consent decrees, and during that time songwriters have licensed fractionally.   The DOJ and the federal courts that supervised this process were clearly aware that this was the practice and they didn’t object.  In fact many of the opinions from the courts and DOJ documents explicitly reference and require the practice of fractional licensing. Yet last summer this small group of lawyers “answered” the question that no one was asking.  They in effect said “yes in fact the consent decrees have always required 100% licensing.”  Ok…then why has  the DOJ been involved in the business of fractional licensing for the last 70+ years? There are only two conclusions: For the last 70 years the consent decrees were improperly administered by dozens of really sharp DOJ attorneys and federal judges, but this new crew is smarter than all of them combined. or This was a political decision designed to benefit a favored corporation.  Or in the popular vernacular: corruption. What do you think? Fortunately BMI and SONA (Songwriters of North America)  separately sued the DOJ (two different and distinct legal complaints against 100% licensing).   In mid September a federal judge considered BMI’s complaint and  ruled against the DOJ.   However a few days after the presidential election the lame duck DOJ antitrust division appealed the ruling.   I suppose this was timed to come after the election when popular songwriters were no longer needed on the election trail.  Right? Perfect time to twist the knife! The status of the SONA lawsuit is unclear, but last I heard the DOJ were on the books as still fighting it. But honestly it’s kind of hard to tell.  If you go to the DOJ Antitrust website there are animated gifs of tumbleweeds going across the page accompanied by wind and yipping coyote sound effects. A hobo camp has been set up on the FAQ page and someone needs to deal with all those feral cats that former Assistant AG Renata Hesse was feeding. Regardless, it’s time.   Time to shut this sucker down. Virtually all the 100% licensing lawyers are gone.  Probably off to cash in their chips in the Googley parts of the private sector.  The DOJ should drop the appeal, settle the SONA lawsuit, and give up the 100% licensing push.  Continuing this ridiculous fight only makes the DOJ look petty, corrupt and stupid.  Especially with the very real, life or death legal questions face the DOJ these days.

While the official YouTube application for Android works well in many situations, it is not the lightest of applications. YouTube Go has been designed by Google to improve the experience by creating a lighter app that is not as taxing to the device, and plays better in low-bandwidth or bad reception scenarios. It features a couple of unique features, but lacks also many classic YouTube features such as commenting or channels. The app is currently in beta, and not available in all markets. While it may not be offered on Google Play, it is offered elsewhere. The app itself is not restricted, so that you can run it on your device even if you are not in a supported location. Word of warning: The app is very heavy on the permission side of things. Permissions include rights to record audio at any time, contact modifications, modifying system settings, getting your precise location, reading your text messages and contacts. In fact, it is necessary to register a phone number on first launch of YouTube Go to use it at all . Why that is needed? So that YouTube Go can scan the contacts regularly to show you friends that use the app. YouTube Go The app is a lite version of YouTube which means that you won't get many of the features of YouTube or the YouTube app. Comments are not available for instance, and so aren't channels and many other features. You may use the built-in search to find videos on YouTube, or by browsing the list of recommended videos. The next step is interesting, as videos don't play immediately. You get an informational prompt instead that lists different quality levels, how much Megabyte each level requires when the video is played using it, and a save button for offline watching. Save is not available for all videos though, but I'm not sure if this is a regional feature and not available globally. Video owners may allow or deny options to save or share videos. Apart from options to pick different quality levels based on Megabyte information, and downloading videos if allowed, it is sharing that is the apps' third major feature. You may share videos with friends and family nearby, and google notes that video transfers use no data when shared this way, and that it only takes a quick Internet security check to play the video. This is interesting obviously. Google does not mention how that is done, but the most likely scenario is that it is using another data transfer option for those videos and not mobile data. Closing Words YouTube Go is a lightweight app that delivers some interesting features. It is unfortunately quite hungry when it comes to permissions, and requires you to enter a mobile phone number and link it to a Google Account before you can even get started using it. (via Caschy) Now You: Would you use an app like YouTube Go? Summary Article Name YouTube Go for Android: lite YouTube app by Google Description YouTube Go is a new application for Android by Google designed for markets where available bandwidth and reception may be lacking.

Reply mikef90000 February 9, 2017 at 11:18 pm # "Would you use an app like YouTube Go?" Absolutely NOT! What an intrusive POS with even less functionality than standard, dumbed down, YT. I don't watch videos on my smartphone, but I do use the YT app to bookmark music that pops back up into my brain after decades in the background. Happens when you get older :-). Reply Wayfarer February 10, 2017 at 2:00 am # Absolutely with you, mate. So many people seem to think - in Android - that features are the thing. I think that PERMISSIONS are what's important. Not to mention bloat-code. And given that so many device manufacturers can't be arsed to give us the latest Android updates (so we can control permissions to some extent) then there's a hell of a lot of apps I won't even consider. I really think that Android is a great OS. But it really (REALLY!) needs to get its act together if it wants to start generating trust and confidence. Anyone who thinks the Google Play Store is a safe environment needs their head examined. Reply XenoSilvano February 10, 2017 at 5:15 am # "Word of warning: The app is very heavy on the permission side of things. Permissions include rights to record audio at any time, contact modifications, modifying system settings, getting your precise location, reading your text messages and contacts" No thanks, I was hoping that this app could have served as a substitution for the standard app on a smart phone watch that I use, however I am not willing to give the app all the concessions to the OS that it requests, therefore I will pass Reply Drobak February 10, 2017 at 1:23 pm # I just use Firefox for Android with uBlock Origin to get YouTube videos on smartphone without ads and CPU demanding, battery eating, data wasting shit. Reply Rick A. February 10, 2017 at 1:38 pm # Exactly. i do the same thing and couldn't recommend this method more. Reply Drobak February 10, 2017 at 2:53 pm # I forgot doubly improved privacy, since not only do you get intrinsic protection from using Firefox + uBlock, you also avoid leaking data like a pierced bottle from installing stupidly intrusive crap. The permissions for this particular app are crazy. Recording audio at any time ? Modifying contacts ? Reading text messages ? WTF. Reply Tony February 10, 2017 at 11:57 pm # Like too many Google products, this product is highly invasive. No way will I use this, or the regular YouTube app. Can't wait until a different company comes out with a mobile OS that actually lets you enable/disable permissions per app. Google once had something called AppOps that was a step in the right direction, but it appears that they canned it.

The LG G6 will be unveiled later this month, and according to LG's latest teaser for the device, it may include some sort of intelligent feature. Keep in mind there are persistent rumours floating around about the phone sporting Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa -- or maybe even both. The teaser states "Less artificial. More intelligence" at the top and then "The next generation smartphone, brought to you first by LG" at the bottom. Does that mean the LG G6 will be the first non-Google phone with Google Assistant? Or maybe it'll beat Huawei and be the first phone with Amazon Alexa, as we still don't know when the Huawei Mate 9 will get Alexa. Up until recently, Google Now was the default assistant on Android phones. Google Assistant on the Pixel phones has left many people clamoring for the more robust Google Assistant to be made available on more Android phones. If we had to speculate, we'd say the phone is getting both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, as the statement about "more intelligence" seems to suggest that it'll offer more than one form of intelligence (aka voice assistants). The two could work very well together on a single device when you consider Alexa's huge well of defined skills and integrations and Google Assistant's more conversational approach to AI assistants.

By Jason Hiner and Conner Forrest | February 9, 2017 -- 17:26 GMT (09:26 PST) | Topic: Networking Image: Google Fiber This article was originally published on TechRepublic. While Google Fiber is still reeling from its big pivot last fall, there are signs that Google Fiber 2.0 is emerging from the ashes of Google's most ambitious moonshot. In early February, the "new cities" section of the Google Fiber website quietly moved Louisville, Kentucky from its list of "Potential" cities to "Upcoming" cities, joining San Antonio, Texas and Huntsville, Alabama (while eight other potential cities have been "paused" as Google Fiber finds its feet). While these three metros look like the beachheads where the company will relaunch its gigabit broadband service, Louisville in particular looks like the place where Google Fiber will prototype its next generation architecture, using a mix of fiber optics for the internet backbone and fixed wireless for the last mile to connect customers. This has the potential to supercharge deployments by bypassing the hardest, slowest, and most expensive part of the process--digging ditches and climbing poles to connect cables to every single residence. Download this article as a PDF (free registration required). Meanwhile, as Google Fiber's official launch in Louisville is imminent, its biggest gigabit internet rival in the US--AT&T Fiber--is unleashing an army of employees and contractors to wire up virtually every single home in the city where Google Fiber is preparing to launch the prototype for the 2.0 version of its ultra high speed service. Combined with their ongoing lawsuit over utility pole access in Louisville, it's turning the southern city into the epicenter of the fiber broadband wars of 2017--with important implications for the future of both companies and gigabit internet across the United States. Google Fiber in Louisville When the Google Fiber team moved Louisville to the "Upcoming" cities on one section of its website, it may have been the case of someone on the Google Fiber team jumping the gun on information that wasn't supposed to be public yet, because Louisville was still listed as a "Potential" city on the Google Fiber map and on Google Fiber's Louisville page. We reached out to Google Fiber for comment, but the company said that nothing had changed and provided no additional information on upcoming announcements. We reached out to the City of Louisville, but it would not confirm or deny that Louisville was about to be announced as a Fiber city. "We are in regular communications with the Google Fiber team, which continues to remain committed to bringing their service to Louisville," said Grace Simrall, chief of civic innovation for Louisville Metro Government. "We would be thrilled to have Google Fiber complete their exploratory work and announce that Louisville is a Google Fiber city." Google Fiber has had a unique connection to the city ever since Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer went to bat for Google Fiber with a "One Touch Make Ready" ordinance that gave Google Fiber (and other broadband challengers) the right to make use of public utility poles owned by providers such as AT&T. Louisville and Google argued that the move was a common sense measure to bring more broadband competition and quickly spread ultra high speed internet throughout the city. Installing fiber optic cables is a complicated and labor-intensive process. Image: iStockphoto/eyjafjallajokull AT&T took the city to court over it, and Louisville immediately morphed into an important battleground for the future of Google Fiber and broadband. In the initial Google Fiber cities, it could simply make a deal with the city and get to work. However, Louisville was more like many other US cities with a tangled web of ownership, laws, and ordinances around utilities. If Google Fiber could make it in Louisville, then it could set a precedent that could spread to other cities. Fischer again stepped up and said, "We will vigorously defend the lawsuit filed today by AT&T. Gigabit fiber is too important to our city's future." Google Fiber joined the lawsuit on Louisville's side, and published a blog post in which it said, "Mayor Fischer, we couldn't agree with you more, and stand with you." But, "One Touch Make Ready" quickly spread to Nashville, which passed a similar ordinance and also got sued by AT&T. Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum) joined the AT&T lawsuit in Louisville and Comcast joined the AT&T lawsuit in Nashville. Both court cases are still pending. The other thing that makes Google Fiber in Louisville unique is the way it's being deployed. SEE: Fiber broadband: Is it a waste with 5G and Elon Musk's satellites on the horizon? In the summer of 2016, Google Fiber was in Louisville setting up locations for "fiber huts"--a key part of the infrastructure for its fiber-to-the-premises deployments--when the company bought Webpass, a fixed wireless provider that has provided high-quality, gigabit-speed internet in several major metros across the US. When the Webpass deal closed, Google Fiber stated, "We're particularly excited about Webpass' application of point-to-point wireless deployment methodology... Our strategy going forward will be a hybrid approach with wireless playing an integral part." Since the Webpass announcement, there's been no evidence that Google Fiber continued its progress on fiber huts in Louisville--where the TechRepublic editorial team has had its headquarters since 1999 and has reporters on the ground. Instead, the company began rethinking its architecture around the idea of deploying much cheaper and faster using ultra high speed wireless for the so-called "last-mile" connections to homes. Fiber installations typically involve lots of trucks, cables, and construction cones. Image: iStockphoto/kummeleon And then, in October, Google Fiber stumbled. It parted ways with CEO Craig Barrett, reportedly laid off 9% of its staff, and paused deployments in "potential" Fiber cities while it made changes to its strategy that included a "focus on new technology and deployment methods." However, the company also released a statement that it was still continuing its work in one of the "potential" cities: Louisville. "We are excited to bring Google Fiber to Louisville and are still figuring out the path," said a Google spokesperson. "We've made great progress working with the city and are excited to find innovative new ways to deploy superfast internet, such as One Touch Make Ready and wireless technology. We'll make a full announcement with the city at the right time." With the recent change on the Google Fiber website, that announcement now appears imminent. As its official statement makes clear, Google Fiber's Louisville network is going to include its wireless Webpass technology for last-mile connections to homes. While other cities where Google Fiber had already done infrastructure work--San Antonio, Huntsville, and Raleigh, North Carolina--have continued with the same technology as the original Google Fiber cities, the timing of the Louisville build (along with the One Touch Make Ready battle) has made it the perfect candidate for Google Fiber to launch the 2.0 version of its gigabit ambitions. AT&T Fiber in Louisville While the city of Louisville has said that several providers have expressed interest in providing fiber since the One Touch Make Ready ordinance passed, AT&T poses the stiffest competition to Google Fiber in the Louisville market. When Google first added the Kentucky city to its list of potential Fiber deployments in September 2015, AT&T responded three months later, claiming that it would soon be connecting the city to its fiber network. AT&T was prepared to defend its turf. In March 2016, AT&T touted to the press that it was about to connect its first two subdivisions to gigabit fiber in Louisville. A month later, Google Fiber started scoping out possibilities for "fiber huts." In July, AT&T started bragging that it was already installing gigabit fiber throughout Louisville--even as Google Fiber was getting all the hype after the One Touch Make Ready ordinance, but had yet to start its deployment. Then, in August, AT&T openly mocked Google Fiber's decision to start using wireless to speed up its deployments. In a published statement, AT&T said: "Google Fiber still complains it's too hard... Meanwhile, without excuses or finger-pointing, and without presenting ultimatums to cities in exchange for service, AT&T continues to deploy fiber and to connect our customers to broadband services in communities across the country. Welcome to the broadband network business, Google Fiber. We'll be watching your next move from our rear view mirror." Around the same time, we spoke with one of AT&T's U-verse installers, who said the company was in the process of hiring a ton of contractors to lay fiber. He noted that AT&T didn't normally hire a lot of third-party contractors to lay cable because of its strict guidelines to ensure network quality. But, in this case, AT&T wanted to speed up the build-out. Download a PDF version of this article (free registration required). By the late summer and early fall, AT&T contractors in unmarked white vans could be seen digging trenches and laying fiber cables throughout several northeastern Louisville neighborhoods. On October 18, AT&T Fiber officially launched in Louisville, with AT&T claiming that the service was "available widely." However, AT&T refused to reveal where in the city its service was available and how many customers would have access to it, for "competitive reasons." Despite asking around the tech community in Louisville, at the time we were unable to find a single customer who had AT&T Fiber installed, or even anyone who had it available in their neighborhood based on AT&T's web-based form. (It would be three months before we were able to track one down.) It was easy to conclude that this is why sites like TechDirt have accused AT&T of "delivering gigabit speeds to high-end housing developments, then pretending the upgrades are much, much larger than they actually are... We're not living in the age of fiber to the home--so much as we're living in the age of fiber to the press release." AT&T Fiber in Louisville appeared to halt altogether sometime in late October. Once the lawsuit went into effect and Google Fiber announced that it was scaling back on October 25, 2016, the contractors doing the digging for AT&T Fiber seemingly disappeared. For the next couple months, it seemed as if everything was in limbo. AT&T vans became a far less common occurrence in the residential areas where they had been digging, and no real press releases or marketing came out about AT&T Fiber in Louisville. In one particular subdivision that had seen contractors working nearly everyday, they suddenly stopped showing up after finishing their digging in only about half of the neighborhood. As it got late into December, things suddenly started moving again. AT&T is furiously laying fiber optic cables throughout Louisville to beat Google Fiber to the punch. Image: AT&T A TechRepublic reader in Louisville reported that AT&T Fiber was up on the poles installing cables in his neighborhood of Germantown--an older area of the city near downtown. The workers were in a clearly marked AT&T truck and the reader confirmed with the technicians that they were hanging fiber. However, AT&T's website still doesn't show his neighborhood as having AT&T Fiber available. AT&T's work across the city has exploded since. TechRepublic has heard from several contractors associated with AT&T that the company is bringing in more and more contractors and is working non-stop to put tons of new fiber in the area. It has told the contractors that they have to keep up or else AT&T will give the business to others who can. And, that it expects to work continuously over the next couple years bringing fiber to every corner of the city. It doesn't appear to be a coincidence that AT&T Fiber's sudden renewed urgency in Louisville has coincided with the expectation that Google Fiber could use Louisville as the prototype for its next generation fiber cities. Interestingly enough, even after months of searching, we have only found one AT&T Fiber customer in the Louisville city limits (which includes all of Jefferson County) and two additional AT&T Fiber customers in neighboring suburbs (Oldham County). Back in April 2016, the city of Louisville launched SpeedUpLouisville.com for residents to share their internet speeds. It was a crowdsourced attempt at creating a map of broadband progress throughout the area. The city was hoping to celebrate when the first gigabit customers started showing up. Ten months and over 4,000 speed tests later, we have confirmed with the people who run the site that no one with gigabit speeds has ever run a speedtest on the site. SEE: Harnessing IoT in the Enterprise (ZDNet/TechRepublic special report) Still, AT&T's director of global media relations, Jeff Kobs, told TechRepublic: "Our [AT&T Fiber service] is available to tens of thousands of homes, apartments and small business locations" in Louisville. "We have the largest fiber network across the 21 states where we offer home internet service," Kobs said. "Today, we're marketing access to nearly 4 million locations across 46 metros nationwide. By mid-2019 we plan to reach at least 12.5 million locations across 67 metro areas." One of the AT&T Fiber customers we spoke with just received his service in the Oldham County suburbs on January 23, 2017. The customer claimed that an AT&T representative was going door-to-door to sell the service in his subdivision on January 16. But, it should be noted that the entire subdivision was previously set up for fiber, with fiber-to-the-premises already installed. The customer confirmed his service with a screenshot of his speedtest, but said he doesn't know anyone else in his neighborhood who has AT&T Fiber yet. The one person we talked to who is an AT&T Fiber customer in the Louisville city limits was Aaron Miller, who lives on the far eastern edge of Jefferson County, not far from the border with Oldham County. Miller lives in a newer subdivision and believes that the neighborhood itself may have been wired for fiber at the time that it was built. "They weren't digging up the streets," he said. "There weren't a lot of trucks in the neighborhood." Still, Miller said he was happy with the service now that he's got it. "I know that, probably, the reason we have AT&T Fiber is because they knew Google Fiber was coming." That competition is good news for Louisville area residents, who, like most Americans have had to put up with mediocre internet service from the duopoly of cable and DSL providers for the past decade and a half. And, while having one fiber gigabit provider is good, having two is much better. The Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Council has released a study that claims bringing a second gigabit provider to a market "reduces prices by approximately $57-62 per month, or between 34% to 37%." The FTTH Council also noted that each additional gigabit competitor increases the likelihood that other providers will begin to offer higher speed broadband as well. During 2016, Louisville's incumbent ISP, Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum), gave its customers a free 6x speed boost as a pre-emptive strike against AT&T Fiber and Google Fiber. For example, customers that were getting the top tier speed of 50Mpbs, were updated to 300Mbps and also received a new modem/router for free.

Final word All of AT&T's moves over the past couple months in Louisville appear to indicate that the telecom giant is looking to go to war over the next generation of internet broadband. And, it views Google Fiber as its most dangerous opponent. Meanwhile, Google Fiber appears to be done licking its wounds and wants to out-innovate AT&T by using a mix of high-end fiber and point-to-point wireless to deploy its gigabit broadband faster, and to more people, than AT&T Fiber. That journey looks like it's going to begin in Louisville. With the lawsuit ongoing, it's clear that this battle is getting personal. Google Fiber is setting the stage for its comeback tour, to display its latest innovations. AT&T, on the other hand, is hoping to stamp out any energy the upstart could drum up, working hard to dig and deploy gigabit before Google Fiber arrives in Derby City. In the fight for the next generation internet, Louisville is set to be the Gettysburg of the fiber war--in the courtroom and neighborhood-to-neighborhood. Also see Think Google Fiber's fast?

SUBSCRIBE Survey: Alexa the most frequently used assistant, Cortana seen as most accurate Nearly 60 percent used voice because it was faster or easier than typing. Greg Sterling on February 9, 2017 at 1:41 pm More Here come the voice-search and virtual assistant surveys. Two weeks ago, Stone Temple Consulting released survey data on voice assistants. This week, HigherVisibility has published a survey asking similar questions of roughly 2,000 smartphone owners in the US. The most interesting finding in this new survey is the fact that Alexa is used more regularly than its competitors. Though there are fewer Alexa devices in the market, its audience appears to be the most engaged. It’s used “at least once a day” by a higher percentage of the installed base than Siri, Google Assistant or Cortana. This higher Alexa usage frequency might be partly explained by the fact that people buy Echo/Alexa specifically for its virtual assistant capabilities, whereas other assistants are essentially a feature of smartphones, which people buy for a number of reasons. Google Home was not included in this survey (or didn’t show up). It will be interesting to see whether the usage patterns with Google Home are similar to those for Alexa. Another noteworthy finding is the perception that Cortana is the most accurate virtual assistant. Two caveats: It’s not clear whether or how accuracy was defined in the survey, and the data are entirely self-reported. It’s not based on competitive testing or objective comparisons. However, all of the major assistants scored well in perceived accuracy. That’s another striking finding. The most common virtual assistant use cases are reflected in the chart below. Music, alarms and weather are the top three. Expect this list to change over time as people become more comfortable doing a broader range of queries and lookups with voice. Local business searches were almost in the middle of the list (slightly below the midpoint). The most common voice-usage scenario was “while driving.” That was followed by activities that made it difficult for people to look at or manually interact with their smartphones. Roughly 59 percent of respondents also said that they used voice because it was “faster” or “easier” than typing or opening a browser. As one might expect, Millennials were much heavier users of voice assistants than Gen Xers and Boomers — combined. However, members of those earlier generations did use voice across a range of activities. Finally, the survey found that men and women had slightly different usage patterns, though not usage frequency. A full discussion of the survey findings can be found here.

SUBSCRIBE Google is testing a new way to report offensive Autocomplete suggestions Feedback tool is currently in limited testing, but company hopes to launch it worldwide soon. Matt McGee on February 9, 2017 at 2:32 pm More Google is testing a new, more visible way for searchers to report potentially offensive suggestions in its Autocomplete feature. The test is currently limited to a very small percentage of Google users, but the company says it hopes to roll it out to all users around the world soon. Google shared the screen shot below of one version of the reporting tool — you can see the gray text, “Report offensive query,” in the bottom right, below the last Autocomplete suggestion. This may not necessarily be what the final feedback invitation looks like, but is one version in testing now. A Google spokesperson confirmed the feedback test in a statement shared with Search Engine Land: “Autocomplete predictions are based on searches previously carried out by users around the world. That means that predicted terms are sometimes unexpected or offensive. We have been actively working on improvements to our algorithm that will help surface more high quality, credible content on the web. In addition, we’re experimenting with a new feature that allows people to report offensive Search predictions. We’re working to incorporate such feedback into our algorithms, and we hope to roll this out more broadly over time. Autocomplete isn’t an exact science and we’re continually working to improve it.” Google users have already been able to report offensive Autocomplete predictions, but only via a form that’s buried in Google’s support pages. Putting the feedback invitation right in the Autocomplete suggestions will certainly make it more visible and should lead to a lot more reports. Autocomplete is Google’s tool that relies on worldwide search activity to predict what a user is searching for and display potentially matching queries. But it’s a feature that has come under fire for years. There were accusations last year that Autocomplete was filtering results to Hillary Clinton’s benefit. Before that, the company responded to complaints by removing the phrase “how can I join ISIS” from Autocomplete. Google’s come under fire for racist suggestions in Autocomplete, and has gone to court on several occasions over predicted Autocomplete queries.

Forums Join   Small ISP Angie Promises to Finish What Google Fiber Started by Karl Bode Thursday Feb 09 2017 14:00 EST A new startup ISP by the name of Angie Communications is promising to finish what Google Fiber started in cities the company recently abandoned. Last October, Google Fiber stated the company would be "pausing" deployment in a handful of potential target cities as the company paused to consider a pivot to next-generation wireless broadband. Angie this week issued a press statement insisting it would "enter cities where Alphabet/Google has stopped its Fiber-to-the-Home projects" and "fill the void" Google Fiber left in those markets. Before users get too excited, realize that Angie's actual deployment scope is notably smaller than the company implies in its press release. By and large, Angie's focus is in utilizing the dark fiber already in the ground in many metropolitan areas, not on doing the heavy lifting Google Fiber has been attempting with massive fiber builds. “Our approach is different from Google Fiber and any other fiber operator,” said Neal Lachman, Group CEO of Angie Communications. "Instead of pulling fiber to millions of premises, which is very time consuming and requires an investment of billions of dollars, Angie capitalizes on the tens of billion dollars worth fiber that is already invested and rolled out by our partners. In the USA, there are more than 30,000 on-net buildings within Angie’s reach, already connected by our partners." Angie promises that they'll large scale rollouts, starting over the next three to four months in soon to be announced cities. The company says its goal is to connect 100,000 buildings and five million premises with fiber over the next five years.Of course the telecom industry has no shortage of promises that fail to materialize, but hopefully Angie can fill the void in a few of the locations (like Portland) that feel like they were left high and dry by Google Fiber's sudden about face. Still, this is less about "finishing what Google started," and more about PR piggybacking on the frustration surrounding what Google Fiber may be leaving unfinished. tags: Fiber · competition · business · alternatives · bandwidth · content · consumers News Jump Sprint's Owner Continues to Talk Sale or T-Mobile Merger AT&T Workers Authorize Strike as Contract Standoff LoomsForum Topic: Tracking the Progress of Altice's Fiber BuildVerizon Disputes Study Claiming T-Mobile's Gaining GroundFriday Morning LinksCharter Sued For Post Merger Billing Screw UpsWeekend Open Thread!Comcast Told to Stop Lying About 'Fastest Internet' Ad ClaimsAs T-Mobile Network Improves, Verizon Needs To Stop BullshittingAT&T Plans 5G Wireless Tests at 3.7-4.2 GHz And Above----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 25 comments dishrich join:2006-05-12 Springfield, IL180.5 24.0 dishrich Member 2017-Feb-9 2:32 pm another "Gigapower" provider In the USA, there are more than 30,000 on-net buildings within Angie’s reach, already connected by our partners.Basically all pretty much (large) apartment/condo complexes & office buildings & VERY minimal residential homes - IE: more "Gigapower" deployments... · actions · 2017-Feb-9 2:32 pm · battleop join:2005-09-28 00000 battleop Member 2017-Feb-9 3:15 pm I'm just curios...

In other words, they are indeed cherry picking only those buildings with the highest population densities. To summarize, therefore: They are cherry picking locations They are not going to contribute anything to the actual fiber footprint They are targeting markets where Google already did all the work of selecting for viabilitySounds like a PR move, and a very lazy one at that.

The LG G6 will be unveiled later this month, and according to LG's latest teaser for the device, it may include some sort of intelligent feature. Keep in mind there are persistent rumours floating around about the phone sporting Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa -- or maybe even both. The teaser states "Less artificial. More intelligence" at the top and then "The next generation smartphone, brought to you first by LG" at the bottom. Does that mean the LG G6 will be the first non-Google phone with Google Assistant? Or maybe it'll beat Huawei and be the first phone with Amazon Alexa, as we still don't know when the Huawei Mate 9 will get Alexa. Up until recently, Google Now was the default assistant on Android phones. Google Assistant on the Pixel phones has left many people clamoring for the more robust Google Assistant to be made available on more Android phones. If we had to speculate, we'd say the phone is getting both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, as the statement about "more intelligence" seems to suggest that it'll offer more than one form of intelligence (aka voice assistants). The two could work very well together on a single device when you consider Alexa's huge well of defined skills and integrations and Google Assistant's more conversational approach to AI assistants.

Today, the company has released the second developer preview of Android Things, with a number of new additions and bug fixes. See also: What is Android Things? – Gary explains 4 weeks ago Developer Preview 2 now includes support for the Intel Joule hardware platform, which Google says offers “the most computing power in our lineup to date” for Android Things-based devices. USB Audio support to the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) has been included for the Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi 3 boards with this new release. Developers who use native C or C++ code for their IoT products can now continue to use it with Android Things, thanks to the newly added native access to the Peripheral API (PIO). Google has also created sample code for the OS that shows developers how to use the TensorFlow machine learning software library on Android Things devices.  It includes demos that can access a camera on such a board so it can use  its object recognition and image classification features. The new support also adds a way speak out the results using text-to-speech (TTS) features. Android Things seems to be shaping up rather well for IoT devices, along with anyone who is making side products that can use the OS. Google says it will be providing new Developer Preview builds with additional features and bug fixes every eight weeks or so, but the company has not yet offered a timeline for when it plans to release the final version.

The feature, called Home Control, lets you use voice commands to control products like Belkin’s WeMo, Nest, Philips Hue, and Samsung SmartThings. By centralizing the devices to Google Assistant, you won’t need to constantly look for individual apps or invest in a Google Home if you don’t already have one. You can find the new controls under Google Assistant, then the Home Control tab. Google Assistant is currently available on just Pixel and Pixel XL phones. Rumors claim the LG G6 will be the next non-Pixel device to receive the AI, but more details will emerge when the phone is officially unveiled on February 26.

What's New in Google's Long-Awaited Android Wear 2.0 Google's Android Wear 2.0 mobile OS is finally reaching the market after months of delay. This slide show looks at the new features to see if they can wake up the somnolent smartwatch market. Android Wear 2.0 Has a More Useful Watch Face The watch face has gotten a makeover in Android Wear 2.0. It’s always lit up in the new version, so users can see the time, check out notifications and more without having to lift their wrist. It also can be personalized far more extensively than in the original version, allowing users to choose which data to display. It Now Has Its Own App Marketplace for Wearables Android Wear 2.0 comes with a built-in app marketplace with programs designed specifically for the operating system and wearable devices. Android Wear users no longer must use an app marketplace that mainly services other devices. There Are New Fitness Features Apparently responding to those who want a fitness tracker, Google added pace- and distance-tracking as well as data on burned calories and heart rate in Android Wear 2.0. It even measures reps during weight lifting, situps and squats. Google Fit, the company’s fitness app, is still included as well. Message Handling Is Improved In Android Wear 2.0, users can expand a message notification and respond right there without opening the operating system. Users can send voice and text messages, as well as digitally handwritten responses and emoji. Messages Work with Third-Party Apps Android Wear 2.0’s messaging features will be extended to third-party apps. According to Google, all of the response methods built into the operating system also will be available on Facebook Messenger, Glide, Telegram and other apps. Google Assistant Is Standing By Google Assistant, the company’s latest virtual personal assistant, is fully supported in Android Wear 2.0. Users can ask their smartwatch questions, set reminders, create to-do lists and more. The feature is activated by saying “OK, Google,” or by holding down the power button on a watch. Google Partners with LT on Hardware Design Google didn’t make its own hardware for Android Wear 2.0, but did work closely with LG to deliver new devices. LG is offering both the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport to kick off Android Wear 2.0’s release. Both devices come with powerful processors and stylish designs. The LG Watch Sport features near-field communication, GPS and even cellular connectivity. Both devices will be available starting Feb. 10. The New OS Supports Other Available Smartwatches Existing Android Wear device owners will be able to use the new operating system, but not all devices are supported. Google has released a list of supported devices, which include Asus ZenWatch 2 and 3, Huawei Watch, Moto 360 2nd Gen and Michael Kors Access Smartwatches. Some older devices won’t be able to run Android Wear 2.0. Google Hasn't Discussed Broad Developer Support Google hasn’t shared much information on app support for Android Wear 2.0. It’s believed that most of the developers that support the operating system already will continue to do so in the newly available marketplace. However, app developer support depends on how popular Android Wear devices are with consumers. Android Wear 2.0 Is Available Feb. 10 Android Wear 2.0 devices, including the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, are slated to be available to customers Feb. 10. Those who want to run Android Wear 2.0 on their existing devices can upgrade via an over-the-air update within the next few of weeks.

Android Wear 2.0 was introduced at Google’s I/O Conference in May and was supposed to be released late last year. But after unexpected delays, Google was forced to push back its release. On Feb. 8, Google finally took the wraps off Android Wear 2.0 and announced it will be available, along with two new smart watches from LG Electronics. The operating system comes with several improvements over its predecessor, including access to an Android Wear app marketplace; support for Google Assistant, the company’s new virtual personal assistant; and additional fitness features. Android Wear 2.0 also boasts some big improvements to its messaging capability. But many existing and prospective wearable device users might be wondering whether it's worth upgrading to Android Wear 2.0 or checking out the next generation of devices that run it. This slide show will by describe some of Android Wear 2.0’s important features.

Despite All My Rage I Am Still Just AI In a Cage What happens when two AIs fight, Thunderdome-style? When computers are left to their own devices, things can get pretty weird. Take, for example, the hallucinogenic ruminations of two jabbering Google Home devices, or the stock market "flash crash" of 2010 that occurred thanks to trading algorithms playing a super-speed game of securities hacky sack with each other.  But what if you just got two algorithms to, like, Thunderdome each other? The Google DeepMind team did essentially this in a blog published on Thursday, and an accompanying paper. In their experiment, Google engineers placed their algorithms in games that resemble the classic prisoner's dilemma thought experiment: do two players, ignorant to the others' intentions, decide to cooperate or betray each other to maximize their individual outcome? Read More: AI Could Resurrect a Racist Housing Policy In the first game, the AIs had to gather scarce apples to receive a reward. They could cooperate, or one player could shoot a beam at the other to briefly take them out of the game and gather more apples for themselves. The second game was similar but more complex. Multiple AIs had to run in a "pack" to catch a target. The AIs could work together to do it, or one could go rogue to capture the target and sacrifice the others.  As it turned out, whether or not the AIs chose to cooperate or betray each other depended on how powerful they were. Basically, if betrayal was the less complicated option, the AI screwed over the other player. If cooperation was easier, banding together was the order of the day, comrades. The more powerful the AI, the more likely it was to cooperate in the game where cooperation was more complex, and ditto for betrayal.  This meant that more powerful algorithms playing the apple game chose to shoot a beam at the other player more often, because it was the more computationally complex option. In the wolfpack game, more powerful AIs chose to work together instead of taking the easier route of becoming a lone wolf and taking the prey down while losing the others.  The DeepMind team concluded that knowing this will help them design future experiments to understand how AIs work together.  But it also raises a concern that really should have been obvious all along. Computers designed to conserve resources are always going to do just that. And would it be wise to tell computers, which use electricity and are manufactured with non-renewable resources, to be inefficient in the first place? This might not be a problem when you're just trying to load up your favorite website, but if in the future competing AIs are governing stock trades or lawyers or, hell, insurance plans, one can imagine how a human might be on the losing end.  Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today made it possible to view web-based virtual reality content through its Chrome browser. The latest version of Chrome for Android devices supports VR, and Google says a number of its partners have begun to add VR content to their web sites. For example, Sketchfab has more than one million 3D scenes available that range from video games to works of art. The Chrome-based VR content requires a Daydream-compatible smartphone and Daydream VR viewer. Daydream handsets are limited to Google's own Pixel and Pixel XL, the Nexus 6P, Moto Z, and ZTE Axon 7. People who don't have Daydream phones can use their mouse or finger to pan around 3D content directly in the browser. Google says it plans to bring web-based VR support to its Cardboard viewer in the months ahead. more info at Google » Related ZTE's Axon 7 Updated with Nougat and Daydream ZTE Shows Off Enhanced Version of Axon 7 Review: ZTE Axon 7 more ZTE Axon 7 news ZTE Axon 7 specs & features ZTE Axon 7 user reviews Google Distributes First Preview of Android 7.1.2 Google Home Gains More Home Automation Powers Pixel and Nexus Phones Snag January Security Patch more Google Pixel news Google Pixel specs & features Google Pixel user reviews Motorola news   Motorola phones ZTE news   ZTE phones Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

In answers to questions following his first public address of the year, opening the A50 forum of leading international fund managers in Sydney, Dr Lowe said the RBA "was in watch and wait mode like everyone else" with the US administration.

Increased spending on infrastructure, reducing regulation, cutting corporate tax, are things that the G20 have been calling for to stimulate economic growth.

It was these policies that Dr Lowe also urged the federal government in Australia to follow. Advertisement Warning on retreat But he also delivered a blunt economic warning to the audience of policymakers and fund managers.  "It could turn out very badly though if we do see the retreat from the open international order, the US economy would be weaker and the world economy would be weaker," he said.

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Former Governor of the Reserve Bank Glenn Stevens arrives at the A50 dinner in Sydney on Thursday night. Photo: Dominic Lorrimer "Australia has benefited greatly from the open international trading system," he said. Year after year, for more than two centuries now, capital from the rest of the world has helped build our country. As investors, Australians have also benefited from being able to diversify our portfolios." While not commenting specifically on President Donald Trump's migration bans that have caused turmoil in the United States and debate around the world, Dr Lowe highlighted the benefits of a dynamic migrant population to the Australian economy. "Our population has recently been growing at around 1.5 per cent a year, and around 40 per cent of us were either born overseas or have one parent born overseas," he said. "This brings a dynamism that isn't there in countries with stagnant and less diverse populations." Upbeat assessment In the address, Dr Lowe delivered an upbeat assessment of the Australian economy but implored Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to borrow more to spend on roads, railways and other infrastructure. Dr Lowe said while it was important for the government to rebuild its finances, that shouldn't stop it borrowing to build the high-quality infrastructure it will need to maintain support for a growing population. "Good transport infrastructure opens up opportunities for people and opens markets. Investment in transportation infrastructure can also play an important role in addressing housing affordability," he said. "Infrastructure investment does of course need to be paid for. The positive news here is that there is no shortage of finance for the right projects." His comments echo those of his predecessor Glenn Stevens, who said public investment in infrastructure could boost the economy, making the Reserve Bank's job easier while lifting Australia's productive capacity. Tax cuts call The government's day-to-day budget would need to move closer to balance in order to give Australia headroom to deal with shocks. A "complication" was the need to make Australia's tax system competitive. "One example of this complication is in the area of corporate tax, where there is a form of international tax competition going on in an effort to attract foreign investment," Dr Lowe said. "Like other countries, we face the challenge of responding to this while achieving a balance between recurrent spending and fiscal revenue." An update of Reserve Bank forecasts to be released on Friday would predict economic growth of around 3 per cent in each of the next two years, boosted by a significant pick-up in liquefied natural gas exports, understood to account for around 0.5 points of growth each year, he said. The economic headwinds from the unwinding of the mining investment boom would "blow themselves out" as 90 per cent of the slide had already happened and Australia's terms of trade had stabilised. Housing presented a "complex picture" with investor demand strengthening and prices in Sydney and Melbourne climbing strongly, while apartment prices in other cities were falling. Although household debt was high, taken together households were "coping reasonably well". Other speakers at the Sydney Opera House on Friday will include Treasurer Scott Morrison, treasury secretary John Fraser, the chiefs of Australian companies Boral, Stockland and Transurban, the chairs of the Prudential and Regulatory Authority and Competition and Consumer Commission Wayne Byres and Rod Sims and Foreign Investment Review Board member David Irvine. 24 comments Log in to comment New User?

Image Credit: Google Google today is talking for the first time about the system that powers its Smart Reply feature for responding to messages on Android Wear 2.0. It goes beyond Smart Reply, as it has shown up inside Inbox by Gmail and more recently the Allo messaging app. Why? Two reasons, really. First, on wearables running Android Wear 2.0, you’ll be able to respond to messages from any messaging app, not just a Google app. Second, this is Google’s first completely on-device machine-learning technology, as Google Research staff research scientist Sujith Ravi explains in a blog post. Google usually looks to powerful computers that are kept remotely in the cloud to operate machine learning models, but not here — with a watch, you want things to work right away. And with a watch there’s less computing and memory capacity than even a smartphone. So Google has thought up a clever system to deal with these constraints. This lines up well with the way that Google shrunk down an artificial neural network and the associated training set to fit a smartphone for instant translations in Google Translate on Android and iOS. (Meanwhile Facebook has been working on similar capabilities, albeit in a very different context: style transfer for photos.) But again, with a watch, everything must be smaller. With watchOS 3, the Apple Watch does offer canned message replies, but it’s not clear what technology Apple uses for them. Importantly, Ravi clearly points out in today’s blog that the model powering suggested message replies can adapt “to cater to the user’s writing style and individual preferences to provide a personalized experience.” Sort of like Google’s Gboard virtual keyboard, that is. Frankly, the sophistication that’s gone into these predictions might be enough to make some people — including me! — give Android Wear 2.0 a go. To train the model to predict applicable replies, Google relies on, among other things, semi-supervised graph learning, which was first documented in a 2015 paper coauthored by Ravi, as well as a method called locality-sensitive hashing. Google will publish a paper on the entire system in a forthcoming paper, Ravi writes. See the full blog post for much more detail.

Show More If there's one thing to take away from this week's Android Wear revamp, it's that no one seems to know what exactly a smartwatch should be. Should it be a simple vessel for keeping up with pertinent alerts and info without having to reach for your phone? Or should it be more about actively running apps and completing grand tasks on its own? Should the watch be something you glance at for a few seconds at a time? Or should it be something you stare at for minutes on end? Above all else, should it serve as a supplement to your smartphone? Or should it be a full-on replacement -- a tiny yet robust communications center on your wrist? Ask most folks who still wear smartwatches today why they do, and I'd be willing to wager the vast majority will give you answers that line up with the first parts of those pairs. More than anything, people who enjoy smartwatches seem to appreciate having easy, glanceable access to notifications and the ability to deal with messages on the fly, with minimal interruption. Yet at the same time, there's no denying that those people -- the ones who actually wear smartwatches, that is -- are part of a small and increasingly limited niche. So that's where we are today, as Google goes back to the drawing board and tries to figure out, again, what might make smartwatches more appealing to the masses. The solution, Google seems to think, involves revamping its Android Wear software to put more emphasis on apps and standalone functionality -- and in many ways, moving toward a view of the smartwatch as an independent entity rather than an extension of your phone. [ To comment on this story, visit JR's Google+ page. ] The shifting focus is particularly evident in the new LG Watch Sport -- the first fully loaded watch Google co-designed to show off Wear's latest capabilities. Like the absurdly named "LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition" (gesundheit!) before it, the Watch Sport features integrated LTE connectivity -- meaning it can get online on its own, without your phone present. And just like with its predecessor, that feature is almost certainly more of a drawback than a perk. Now, mind you, I'm not saying a smartwatch in general is a bad idea (though I have stopped wearing one myself as of late, for my own personal reasons). I'm just saying that, by and large, LTE in a smartwatch is a misguided notion. And for most people, getting on that bandwagon is going to be a mistake. Why? Well, let's think through the reasons: 1. The size factor Having all the components needed for LTE support makes an already-bulky wearable even bulkier. I mean, look at this thing: Google/LG You don't have to take my word for it, though. As some of the early Sport reviewers put it: "It’s a big, honking timepiece on your wrist that’s thick, chunky, and ... isn’t particularly comfortable to wear ... even on my medium-to-large sized wrist." -Dan Seifert, The Verge "The device feels heavy ... like a metal paperweight strapped to your wrist." -Nicole Nguyen, BuzzFeed "It's a heavy and chunky monstrosity that's tough for me to recommend to just about anyone." -Steve Kovach, Business Insider "If I saw you wearing this watch, I would assume you just finished an Ironman." -David Pierce, Wired You get the point. But wait -- there's more... 2. The band factor The component cramming doesn't stop with the watch itself; it also extends into the device's band, which contains all of the antennas (antennae?) for those wireless connections. That means the strap around your wrist is gonna be stiff, uncomfortable, and impossible to swap out for your own preferred alternative. Back to our trusty reviewer panel for perspective: "The first inch of the band on each side is rigid. There is no actual hinge connecting the band to the watch, and the rigid band only starts flexing after the antenna section." -Ron Amadeo, Ars Technica "Not only does that limit the flexibility of the band-attachment points if you're trying to crank down the watch onto a smaller wrist, but some will also be put off by the lack of customization options." -Andrew Martonik, Android Central "The watch may be a bit uncomfortable if you have especially wide wrists, because the band doesn't have much in the way of give up near the body of the watch." -David Ruddock, Android Police "Its fixed rubberized wristband is designed in a permacurve and feels like a gauntlet around my big wrist. ... It really feels too large for most people to consider." -Scott Stein, CNET And if the band ever cracks or gets otherwise damaged -- you know, as watch bands are prone to do with heavy ongoing use -- well, good luck. 3. The battery factor Smartwatch battery life is already a contentious issue. Add an LTE connection into the equation, though? Now you've got the perfect recipe for a dead watch before dinner time. Maestro: "It frequently would tap out before the end of the day, sometimes at 5 p.m., sometimes at 8 p.m., and that’s without using the GPS to track a run or do anything out of the ordinary. ... It's clear that the Sport's extra capabilities are taking a toll." -Dan Seifert, The Verge "Built-in LTE takes its toll on battery fast. On most days, even in casual use, I burned through the Sport's battery in less than a day." -Scott Stein, CNET "Because that data also drains battery like crazy, it also means having to lug around a heavy metal paperweight on your wrist." -Nicole Nguyen, BuzzFeed Is that a compromise you're willing to make? 4. The price factor The Watch Sport's $349 price tag in and of itself may not seem horribly insane, but remember: In order to actually take advantage of the LTE connectivity, in most cases, you're going to have to pay a monthly fee in order for your carrier to recognize the watch as a "connected device" and allow it to tap into your account. Verizon and AT&T, the officially supported launch partners for the watch, tack an extra $5 and $10 per month, respectively, onto your bill for that privilege. (The exception to the rule may be Google's own Project Fi wireless service, which doesn't technically support wearables but does provide a data-only SIM option that -- as of now, at least -- seems to work, though only for data and not for calls. So, there is that as an asterisk, if Fi is your carrier of choice.) 5. The value factor Now for the million-dollar question: Taking all of the above into consideration, is an LTE smartwatch like the LG Watch Sport actually worth owning for you? Let's think about what you'll gain by having a dedicated LTE connection on your watch: a) The ability to make and receive phone calls on your wrist when your phone isn't around C'mon: People using speakerphones in public is bad enough. Please, don't be that guy. b) The ability to get notifications and access data even when your phone isn't around Okay, sure. But how often is that actually going to be relevant and meaningful for you? Maybe you'll rock out to the latest Right Said Fred album while you're out having a run. Or perhaps you'll add some protein powder onto your shopping list while pumping iron at the gym. Those are reasonable things that might be handy for a watch to be able to handle, right? Here's the thing, though: You can actually do those things on a regular ol' Android Wear watch -- one that doesn't have its own LTE connection and all of the associated drawbacks. For the great outdoors, you can download music onto your watch and have it available to direct-to-Bluetooth streaming. And when you're anywhere that has a public or already-known Wi-Fi network -- like, you know, the gym -- you can connect your watch via Wi-Fi and keep it online, even if your phone is miles away. Any Wear watch with GPS can also give you directions without the need for an active data connection. There's still a small window of use that doesn't fall into those categories, of course -- taking phone calls on your wrist whilst trekking down a tranquil nature path, for instance, or responding to text messages on your appendage in the midst of a phone-free jog. The question, though, is how often those scenarios actually come up in your life and whether the benefits you'd get from them would be enough to outweigh all the associated downsides.

Until now, the free version was limited to creating five reports, but you can now create and share as many reports as you want.  Data Studio is the free component of Google Data Studio 360, which is available as a paid-for product for data visualization and reporting with licensing starting at 200 users. It can be used to connect to all your data with native integrations across a range of Google products, as well as non-Google data. Both versions can be used to create reports from data from AdWords, Google Analytics, YouTube, BigQuery, Attribution 360 and Google Sheets. Since the launch, the product has been improved with the addition of templates and new data connectors. New connectors since the initial release include DoubleClick Campaign Manager and DoubleClick Search data; Google BigQuery; Google Cloud SQL; MySQL, and YouTube Channel. The YouTube connector lets you create visualizations from any field available in the YouTube API. The templates provide sample reports for marketing based on Analytics 360 data; ecommerce based on Analytics 360 and Adwords.     There's an adwords overview using just Adwords data, and a YouTube channel analysis. There are two templates based on Google Sheets data, one showing a range of charts and the second charts based on ad performance; and the final Google Analytics 360 template is a dashboard report of the Google merchandise store.   The free version is available for use in more countries - it was originally only available in the US, but can now be used in 22 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The video below is an introduction to Data Studio that shows how it can be used to create reports and dashboards:     The free version is available for download now.   More Information Google Data Site Related Articles Google Data Studio 360 Google Announces Big Data The Cloud Way  Google Cloud Dataflow SDK  Google BigQuery Service Major Update to Google BigQuery   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   Where to Find Top Women Coders 17/01/2017 We are made constantly aware of the gender gap in software development.

DMAMBMCMDMEZBZBRZDZGZHZQZRZSZTZU Six years after it lost the crown to Apple Inc., Google Inc. has reclaimed the title of the most valuable brand in the world. For Android fans, the reversal of fortune is especially gratifying given that much of Apple’s luster was largely due to the success of its iPhone. “Google won out mainly because Apple’s fall was even more dramatic. The iPhone company saw its value drop by 26%,” said HowMuch.Net. As of 2017, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) (GOOG) Google brand is worth $109.47 billion, and Apple (AAPL) is valued at $107.14 billion. See larger map “The market is volatile and their survival is precarious. Huge, wealthy brands can stumble and shrink to a ghost of their former selves,” HowMuch said. Brand value is more than just how much money companies are worth, according to the cost-estimating website. It also captures the abstract quality of how much confidence consumers have in the brand, as well as name recognition. Following closely on Apple’s heels is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) at $106.37 billion. AT&T Inc. (XNYS:T) comes in at fourth with $87.2 billion and Microsoft Corp.(MSFT)  rounds out the top five at $76.27 billion, underscoring the dominance and the prestige of U.S. brands across the globe. Samsung (005930.KS), the Korean conglomerate that makes everything from Galaxy smartphones to apparel, was sixth with a brand value of $66.2 billion. The only other non-American brand to crack the top 10 list was Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, at $47.8 billion, Brand Finance data show. Brand Finance Aside from the predominance of tech names in the U.S., banks were the most valuable in eight countries, although with the exception of Santander in Spain, most did not have much global recognition, according to HowMuch. Energy companies and telecommunication brands also popped up fairly often on the map. You can follow Sue Chang on Twitter at @SueChangMW.

Allies include Mozilla, Microsoft and Facebook, but we can expect some rough patches. Virtual Reality Apps by Stephen Shankland February 9, 2017 10:00 AM PST @stshank Google's Chrome browser logo Stephen Shankland/CNET Google says it's now time to marry two computing realms: the web and virtual reality. Its latest version of the Chrome browser includes a technology called WebVR, which lets programmers create websites that present the computer-generated 3D worlds of virtual reality. If you're into VR, you might appreciate the promise WebVR holds for expanding what you can do with a device like a Google Daydream View or a Facebook Oculus Rift VR headset. That's because, in principle at least, WebVR makes it easier for developers to create a single VR experience that'll work across many VR headsets instead of having to create a separate version for each device. It's an extension of how a single website can span your laptop, Android phone or iPad tablet. WebVR makes it "as easy to step inside Air Force One as it is to access your favorite web page," Megan Lindsay, a product manager on Google's Chrome team, said in a blog post. WebVR without anything to look at isn't any fun, so here are some sites Google promoted for the technology: Bear 71, an interactive nature documentary; Matterport, a library of more than 300,000 celebrity homes and other sites; Within, a collection of VR movies; WebVR Lab, a collection of interactive VR worlds, and Sketchfab, an assortment of VR scenes. Google developed WebVR along with Firefox maker Mozilla, Facebook's Oculus team, and other partners. It's early days though. Microsoft is working on WebVR support for its new Edge browser and HoloLens eyewear, but support is still spotty among makers of VR headsets like HTC's Vive and Samsung's Gear VR. So far, Mozilla has enabled WebVR only in its nightly and developer versions of Firefox aimed at web programmers and the adventurous. But it plans to add WebVR in the mainstream version of its browser this summer, including support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Chrome supports Google's Daydream View headset, which like Gear VR uses a phone to track head motion and display imagery for each eye. But it'll be months before WebVR and Chrome work with the company's cruder Google Cardboard cousin.

The most notable addition is the ability to run TensorFlow for on-device machine learning and computer vision. Leveraging the vast development familiarity with Google’s dominant mobile OS, the Internet of Things platform aims to allow any Android developer to quickly build smart home devices using known Android APIs and Google services. Google plans on releasing a new developer preview every six to eight weeks with new features and bug fixes. DP2 adds support for Intel’s Joule platform, in addition to support for the existing NXP Pico, Intel Edision, and the Rasberry Pi 3. The latter two devices gain USB Audio, with the team continuing to work on issues with Bluetooth support. The most requested features by developers since the December launch was to run machine learning and computer vision on-device. Google has since demonstrated TensorFlow running on Android Things, with an early access library for ARM and x86 now available: This sample demonstrates accessing the camera, performing object recognition and image classification, and speaking out the results using text-to-speech (TTS).

While Google Fiber is still reeling from its big pivot last fall, there are signs that Google Fiber 2.0 is emerging from the ashes of Google's most ambitious moonshot. In early February, the "new cities" section of the Google Fiber website quietly moved Louisville, Kentucky from its list of "Potential" cities to "Upcoming" cities, joining San Antonio, Texas and Huntsville, Alabama (while eight other potential cities have been "paused" as Google Fiber finds its feet). In early February, Louisville was quietly shifted to the list of "Upcoming cities" on the Google Fiber website. While these three metros look like the beachheads where the company will relaunch its gigabit broadband service, Louisville in particular looks like the place where Google Fiber will prototype its next generation architecture, using a mix of fiber optics for the internet backbone and fixed wireless for the last mile to connect customers. This has the potential to supercharge deployments by bypassing the hardest, slowest, and most expensive part of the process—digging ditches and climbing poles to connect cables to every single residence. Meanwhile, as Google Fiber's official launch in Louisville is imminent, its biggest gigabit internet rival in the US—AT&T Fiber—is unleashing an army of employees and contractors to wire up virtually every single home in the city where Google Fiber is preparing to launch the prototype for the 2.0 version of its ultra high speed service. Combined with their ongoing lawsuit over utility pole access in Louisville, it's turning the southern city into the epicenter of the fiber broadband wars of 2017—with important implications for the future of both companies and gigabit internet across the United States. Google Fiber in Louisville When the Google Fiber team moved Louisville to the "Upcoming" cities on one section of its website, it may have been the case of someone on the Google Fiber team jumping the gun on information that wasn't supposed to be public yet, because Louisville was still listed as a "Potential" city on the Google Fiber map and on Google Fiber's Louisville page. Download this article as a PDF (free registration required). We reached out to Google Fiber for comment, but the company said that nothing had changed and provided no additional information on upcoming announcements. We reached out to the City of Louisville, but it would not confirm or deny that Louisville was about to be announced as a Fiber city. "We are in regular communications with the Google Fiber team, which continues to remain committed to bringing their service to Louisville," said Grace Simrall, chief of civic innovation for Louisville Metro Government. "We would be thrilled to have Google Fiber complete their exploratory work and announce that Louisville is a Google Fiber city." Google Fiber has had a unique connection to the city ever since Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer went to bat for Google Fiber with a "One Touch Make Ready" ordinance that gave Google Fiber (and other broadband challengers) the right to make use of public utility poles owned by providers such as AT&T. Louisville and Google argued that the move was a common sense measure to bring more broadband competition and quickly spread ultra high speed internet throughout the city. AT&T took the city to court over it, and Louisville immediately morphed into an important battleground for the future of Google Fiber and broadband. In the initial Google Fiber cities, it could simply make a deal with the city and get to work. However, Louisville was more like many other US cities with a tangled web of ownership, laws, and ordinances around utilities. If Google Fiber could make it in Louisville, then it could set a precedent that could spread to other cities. "We've made great progress working with [Louisville] and are excited to find innovative new ways to deploy superfast internet, such as One Touch Make Ready and wireless technology." Google spokesperson Fischer again stepped up and said, "We will vigorously defend the lawsuit filed today by AT&T. Gigabit fiber is too important to our city's future." Google Fiber joined the lawsuit on Louisville's side, and published a blog post in which it said, "Mayor Fischer, we couldn't agree with you more, and stand with you." But, "One Touch Make Ready" quickly spread to Nashville, which passed a similar ordinance and also got sued by AT&T. Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum) joined the AT&T lawsuit in Louisville and Comcast joined the AT&T lawsuit in Nashville. Both court cases are still pending. The other thing that makes Google Fiber in Louisville unique is the way it's being deployed. In the summer of 2016, Google Fiber was in Louisville setting up locations for "fiber huts"—a key part of the infrastructure for its fiber-to-the-premises deployments—when the company bought Webpass, a fixed wireless provider that has provided high-quality, gigabit-speed internet in several major metros across the US. When the Webpass deal closed, Google Fiber stated, "We're particularly excited about Webpass' application of point-to-point wireless deployment methodology... Our strategy going forward will be a hybrid approach with wireless playing an integral part." Since the Webpass announcement, there's been no evidence that Google Fiber continued its progress on fiber huts in Louisville—where the TechRepublic editorial team has had its headquarters since 1999 and has reporters on the ground. Instead, the company began rethinking its architecture around the idea of deploying much cheaper and faster using ultra high speed wireless for the so-called "last-mile" connections to homes. Nearby southern cities Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, and Raleigh are getting Google Fiber just ahead of Louisville. Image: Google Fiber And then, in October, Google Fiber stumbled. It parted ways with CEO Craig Barrett, reportedly laid off 9% of its staff, and paused deployments in "potential" Fiber cities while it made changes to its strategy that included a "focus on new technology and deployment methods." However, the company also released a statement that it was still continuing its work in one of the "potential" cities: Louisville. "We are excited to bring Google Fiber to Louisville and are still figuring out the path," said a Google spokesperson. "We've made great progress working with the city and are excited to find innovative new ways to deploy superfast internet, such as One Touch Make Ready and wireless technology. We'll make a full announcement with the city at the right time." With the recent change on the Google Fiber website, that announcement now appears imminent. As its official statement makes clear, Google Fiber's Louisville network is going to include its wireless Webpass technology for last-mile connections to homes. While other cities where Google Fiber had already done infrastructure work—San Antonio, Huntsville, and Raleigh, North Carolina—have continued with the same technology as the original Google Fiber cities, the timing of the Louisville build (along with the One Touch Make Ready battle) has made it the perfect candidate for Google Fiber to launch the 2.0 version of its gigabit ambitions.

AT&T Fiber in Louisville While the city of Louisville has said that several providers have expressed interest in providing fiber since the One Touch Make Ready ordinance passed, AT&T poses the stiffest competition to Google Fiber in the Louisville market. When Google first added the Kentucky city to its list of potential Fiber deployments in September 2015, AT&T responded three months later, claiming that it would soon be connecting the city to its fiber network. AT&T was prepared to defend its turf. In March 2016, AT&T touted to the press that it was about to connect its first two subdivisions to gigabit fiber in Louisville. A month later, Google Fiber started scoping out possibilities for "fiber huts." In July, AT&T started bragging that it was already installing gigabit fiber throughout Louisville—even as Google Fiber was getting all the hype after the One Touch Make Ready ordinance, but had yet to start its deployment. Then, in August, AT&T openly mocked Google Fiber's decision to start using wireless to speed up its deployments. In a published statement, AT&T said: "Google Fiber still complains it's too hard... Meanwhile, without excuses or finger-pointing, and without presenting ultimatums to cities in exchange for service, AT&T continues to deploy fiber and to connect our customers to broadband services in communities across the country. Welcome to the broadband network business, Google Fiber. We'll be watching your next move from our rear view mirror." "Google Fiber still complains it's too hard... Meanwhile, without excuses or finger-pointing, and without presenting ultimatums to cities in exchange for service, AT&T continues to deploy fiber." AT&T statement Around the same time, we spoke with one of AT&T's U-verse installers, who said the company was in the process of hiring a ton of contractors to lay fiber. He noted that AT&T didn't normally hire a lot of third-party contractors to lay cable because of its strict guidelines to ensure network quality. But, in this case, AT&T wanted to speed up the build-out. By the late summer and early fall, AT&T contractors in unmarked white vans could be seen digging trenches and laying fiber cables throughout several northeastern Louisville neighborhoods. On October 18, AT&T Fiber officially launched in Louisville, with AT&T claiming that the service was "available widely." However, AT&T refused to reveal where in the city its service was available and how many customers would have access to it, for "competitive reasons." Download a PDF version of this article (free registration required). Despite asking around the tech community in Louisville, at the time we were unable to find a single customer who had AT&T Fiber installed, or even anyone who had it available in their neighborhood based on AT&T's web-based form. (It would be three months before we were able to track one down.) It was easy to conclude that this is why sites like TechDirt have accused AT&T of "delivering gigabit speeds to high-end housing developments, then pretending the upgrades are much, much larger than they actually are... We're not living in the age of fiber to the home—so much as we're living in the age of fiber to the press release." AT&T Fiber in Louisville appeared to halt altogether sometime in late October. Once the lawsuit went into effect and Google Fiber announced that it was scaling back on October 25, 2016, the contractors doing the digging for AT&T Fiber seemingly disappeared. For the next couple months, it seemed as if everything was in limbo. AT&T vans became a far less common occurrence in the residential areas where they had been digging, and no real press releases or marketing came out about AT&T Fiber in Louisville. In one particular subdivision that had seen contractors working nearly everyday, they suddenly stopped showing up after finishing their digging in only about half of the neighborhood. AT&T is furiously laying fiber optic cables throughout Louisville to beat Google Fiber to the punch. Image: AT&T As it got late into December, things suddenly started moving again. A TechRepublic reader in Louisville reported that AT&T Fiber was up on the poles installing cables in his neighborhood of Germantown—an older area of the city near downtown. The workers were in a clearly marked AT&T truck and the reader confirmed with the technicians that they were hanging fiber. However, AT&T's website still doesn't show his neighborhood as having AT&T Fiber available. AT&T's work across the city has exploded since. TechRepublic has heard from several contractors associated with AT&T that the company is bringing in more and more contractors and is working non-stop to put tons of new fiber in the area. It has told the contractors that they have to keep up or else AT&T will give the business to others who can. And, that it expects to work continuously over the next couple years bringing fiber to every corner of the city. It doesn't appear to be a coincidence that AT&T Fiber's sudden renewed urgency in Louisville has coincided with the expectation that Google Fiber could use Louisville as the prototype for its next generation fiber cities. Interestingly enough, even after months of searching, we have only found one AT&T Fiber customer in the Louisville city limits (which includes all of Jefferson County) and two additional AT&T Fiber customers in neighboring suburbs (Oldham County). Back in April 2016, the city of Louisville launched SpeedUpLouisville.com for residents to share their internet speeds. It was a crowdsourced attempt at creating a map of broadband progress throughout the area. The city was hoping to celebrate when the first gigabit customers started showing up. Ten months and over 4,000 speed tests later, we have confirmed with the people who run the site that no one with gigabit speeds has ever run a speedtest on the site. Still, AT&T's director of global media relations, Jeff Kobs, told TechRepublic: "Our [AT&T Fiber service] is available to tens of thousands of homes, apartments and small business locations" in Louisville. "We have the largest fiber network across the 21 states where we offer home internet service," Kobs said. "Today, we're marketing access to nearly 4 million locations across 46 metros nationwide. By mid-2019 we plan to reach at least 12.5 million locations across 67 metro areas." One of the AT&T Fiber customers we spoke with just received his service in the Oldham County suburbs on January 23, 2017. The customer claimed that an AT&T representative was going door-to-door to sell the service in his subdivision on January 16. But, it should be noted that the entire subdivision was previously set up for fiber, with fiber-to-the-premises already installed. The customer confirmed his service with a screenshot of his speedtest, but said he doesn't know anyone else in his neighborhood who has AT&T Fiber yet. "I know that, probably, the reason we have AT&T Fiber is because they knew Google Fiber was coming." Aaron Miller, AT&T Fiber customer in Louisville The one person we talked to who is an AT&T Fiber customer in the Louisville city limits was Aaron Miller, who lives on the far eastern edge of Jefferson County, not far from the border with Oldham County. Miller lives in a newer subdivision and believes that the neighborhood itself may have been wired for fiber at the time that it was built. "They weren't digging up the streets," he said. "There weren't a lot of trucks in the neighborhood." Still, Miller said he was happy with the service now that he's got it. "I know that, probably, the reason we have AT&T Fiber is because they knew Google Fiber was coming." That competition is good news for Louisville area residents, who, like most Americans have had to put up with mediocre internet service from the duopoly of cable and DSL providers for the past decade and a half. And, while having one fiber gigabit provider is good, having two is much better. The Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Council has released a study that claims bringing a second gigabit provider to a market "reduces prices by approximately $57-62 per month, or between 34% to 37%." The FTTH Council also noted that each additional gigabit competitor increases the likelihood that other providers will begin to offer higher speed broadband as well. During 2016, Louisville's incumbent ISP, Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum), gave its customers a free 6x speed boost as a pre-emptive strike against AT&T Fiber and Google Fiber. For example, customers that were getting the top tier speed of 50Mpbs, were updated to 300Mbps and also received a new modem/router for free.

Final word All of AT&T's moves over the past couple months in Louisville appear to indicate that the telecom giant is looking to go to war over the next generation of internet broadband. And, it views Google Fiber as its most dangerous opponent. Meanwhile, Google Fiber appears to be done licking its wounds and wants to out-innovate AT&T by using a mix of high-end fiber and point-to-point wireless to deploy its gigabit broadband faster, and to more people, than AT&T Fiber. That journey looks like it's going to begin in Louisville. With the lawsuit ongoing, it's clear that this battle is getting personal. Google Fiber is setting the stage for its comeback tour, to display its latest innovations. AT&T, on the other hand, is hoping to stamp out any energy the upstart could drum up, working hard to dig and deploy gigabit before Google Fiber arrives in Derby City. In the fight for the next generation internet, Louisville is set to be the Gettysburg of the fiber war—in the courtroom and neighborhood-to-neighborhood.

And it might not be the first time this has happened. By Conner Forrest | February 9, 2017, 8:41 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: ZDNet Screenshot On Wednesday, a top Google search result that seemed to be an advertisement for retail giant Amazon.com was actually something much more sinister—a malicious link to a Windows support scam. The problematic ad was first reported by ZDNet, but it seems that this problem has happened before. Those who clicked on the ad were directed to a fake support website that presented an alert based on the OS they were using. According to ZDNet, Windows users saw a blue-screen-of-death and macOS users were warned that they were infected with crypto-ransomware. Users who reached the scam site were given an error number and told to call a support number for help. However, as long as the didn't call the phone number, their machine would not have been infected with malware, the ZDNet report said. But, trying to exit out of the site could have frozen a user's browser. SEE: Millennials most likely to lose money from tech support scams, says Microsoft What's troubling about this scenario is that the ad looked legitimate, and was able to make it through Google's algorithms to arrive on the front page of search results, landing above the real result for Amazon.com, ZDNet reported. More about IT Security Special report: Cyberwar and the future of cybersecurity (free ebook) Video: Top 5 ways to secure your IoT Interview with a hacker: Kapustkiy from New World Hackers Subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter The ad was a paid ad, and seemed to resolve to Amazon.com, which could have been how the site behind the ad fooled Google. However, the ad no longer appears on Google's search results. While this instance of a bad ad seemed novel, it may not be the first time this kind of malicious ad has made it to the top of Google's search results. According to user posts on a Y Combinator forum from late January, similar ads pointing to Amazon, and others pointing to YouTube, have popped up in the past. In early February, another similar issue arose when the customer support number listed for Facebook on Google's search results actually directed users to a phone scam. Additionally, Google's Gmail recently had trouble filtering spam from a spoofed@gmail.com address as well. However, this doesn't mean that Google hasn't taken steps to combat bad ads. In 2016, the company reportedly took down 1.7 billion ads that violated their advertising policies. Also, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been working for years to fight against support scams like the ones found in these malicious ads. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Recently, the top Google search result for Amazon.com directed users to a support scam website that tried to convince them their computer was infected with malware. As long as users didn't call the listed phone number, their computer would not have been infected. Malicious ads have appeared in Google search results for major companies in the past, but Google has worked to remove 1.7 billion ads that violate its policies.

Google officially brings WebVR to Chrome Posted yesterday by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story The Analogue Nt Mini is the perfect NES console for video game lovers Virtual reality is coming to the web. Using VR on your phone has always been a pretty deliberate decision, you slot your phone into a headset, navigate the internal menus and home screens and launch apps and experiences from within the headset. Now, Google is making it easier to discover VR content spontaneously by bringing WebVR to Chrome. Previously Chrome lacked mobile browser support for WebVR, meaning that the browser couldn’t gather any data regarding the phone’s position and orientation or input controller. With this data, Chrome has the ability to offer pretty rich experiences. Users can navigate to a particular webpage, tap on a WebVR experience and have the option of navigating it with their finger (or mouse on desktop) or tossing the phone into their Daydream View to embrace a more immersive experience. In December, Google rolled out support for the WebVR API to a beta of Chrome, but now that update is going wide. WebVR allows companies and content creators to delve into the world of creating VR experiences without having to host those experiences in a native VR app. This update to Chrome not only allows websites to host 360-degree videos that users can view, but it also supports enabling full experiences with the Daydream headset and controller. In Google’s blog post, the company highlighted some early partners including SketchFab, Matterport, and PlayCanvas. Right now, this expansion is limited to users of Google’s Daydream headsets as well as people viewing the VR content on their phone or desktop without a headset. Google says they plan to add support for other headsets soon, including their own Cardboard platform. Given that this only works for Daydream, iPhone users are obviously not included here, but iOS may see some love once Google rolls out full Cardboard support. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Virtual Reality Popular Posts Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 13 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 14 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 15 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 18 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 9 hours ago | Anthony Ha Weekly Roundup: Tech companies rally against Trump’s immigration ban, Zenefits cuts workforce again 10 hours ago | Anna Escher Trump’s immigration ban is terrible for entrepreneurs 10 hours ago | Samia Bahsoun Payback’s a gift 11 hours ago | Talia Goldberg, Jeremy Levine Comment moderation powered by Up Next The Analogue Nt Mini is the perfect NES console for video game lovers Posted yesterday CrunchBoard Job Listings Data Migration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) Integration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE at Waxman Strategies (Washington, DC, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Data Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google today is announcing that people can now view virtual reality (VR) content in the Chrome app on Daydream-ready Android devices such as the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. This is the first time such capability is becoming a part of a stable build of Chrome. This type of VR experience will work now on Google’s Daydream View headset when used with the Pixel phones. But you’ll also be able to explore VR sites even without this sort of equipment. “If you don’t have a headset you can view VR content on any phone or desktop computer and interact using your finger or mouse,” Google product manager Megan Lindsay wrote in a blog post. In the next few months, Lindsay wrote, Google will make it possible to view VR pages inside the Google Cardboard VR headset. This whole time the Cardboard experience, and the Google Daydream View experience, has been constrained to apps, but now it’s coming to the web — specifically through the Chrome browser, which has more than 1 billion active users on Android and iOS. Google has been taking steps to prepare for this moment. More than a year ago now, Google chose Clay Bavor to head up its VR division. It introduced the Pixels as the first Daydream-ready phones in October. In December it introduced an origin trial for developers to try the WebVR application programming interface (API) in the beta release of Chrome 56 for Android. And in May Google hired Josh Carpenter, the head of Mozilla’s MozVR initiative. He’s been working on WebVR as a user interface designer for immersive computing at Google. The WebVR API is also available in the Firefox Nightly browser, in preview in Microsoft’s Edge browser (with build 15002 for Insiders), and in Samsung’s internet browser for its Gear VR headset. Google is in the process of bringing WebVR to Chrome for desktop operating systems, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. As of now, developers still need to enroll in the origin trial to get a token for the WebVR API, the spokesperson wrote.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Assistant on Pixel is getting more robust home control Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 7 379 9 Owners of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL may soon be able to control their smart home devices from their phone, via Google Assistant. A handful of Pixel users have reported that the Assistant app has been updated to allow for such support, without the need to use the Google Home connected speaker. See also: Google Home adds support for Belkin Wemo and Honeywell smart devices 2 weeks ago According to what a tipster sent to Android Police, a new Home Control setting in the Google Assistant app is now available on his Pixel handset. It allows users to add smart home devices like lights, cameras and more that can be controlled by speaking commands to the phones. The app also lets users set up which rooms in a home have specific smart devices, for even more customization of your voice controls. This development is certainly huge for Pixel owners who have smart devices in their house, but may not yet have purchased Google Home. The tipster stated his phone had the recently released beta of Android 7.1.2 Nougat installed, along with version 6.12.19 of the Google search app and version 10.2.98 of Google Play Services. It’s possible that this new home control support is slowly being rolled out to be tested by a tiny portion of the Pixel audience before it is made available to all owners of the handset. Google Assistant is currently only available on the Pixel and Pixel XL in terms of smartphones, although recent rumors claim it will also be available for the LG G6 when it launches later this year. We suspect even more phones will include Google Assistant in the future, and that could also allow for the voice-based AI to expand its user base for controlling smart home devices.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Play prepares to remove apps over missing privacy policies Eric Abent - Feb 9, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Beginning next month, the number of apps offered through the Google Play Store may thin out a bit. Google has been sending out emails to developers alerting them to what is likely an incoming purge, and telling them what they can do to avoid it. Apparently, Google isn’t too fond of the fact that a number of apps require sensitive permissions from users, but don’t provide a privacy policy to explain why the apps need those permissions. The Next Web got its hands on one of these emails, which are being sent out to developers who are currently in violation of Google Play’s personal and sensitive information user data policy. “Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information,” the email reads. “Your app requests sensitive permissions (e.g. camera, microphone, accounts, contacts, or phone) or user data, but does not include a valid privacy policy.” In order to bring the offending app in line with the rules, Google says that developers must link to a valid privacy policy in both the Play Store listing and within the app itself. On the other hand, developers can avoid the requirement altogether by removing any permissions for sensitive data from the app. Developers have until March 15 to make their apps complaint. If they aren’t by that date, Google might take actions such as reducing visibility or removing the apps entirely. This could be a good thing for developers trying to gain a foothold in the Google Play Store, and this purge could remove a ton of “zombie apps” from the store. Zombie apps can cause quite a big problem for developers who are trying to make a name for themselves and their apps on the Google Play Store, as they take up space and make it harder for up-and-comers to get their apps seen. We’ll see just how much this helps the situation next month. Many of those zombie apps won’t be updated to become compliant with Google’s rules, so we can likely expect to see many removed when March 15 rolls around.

By Charlie Osborne for Between the Lines | February 7, 2017 -- 11:17 GMT (03:17 PST) | Topic: Innovation Ivyrevel Finding the perfect top or dress for a night out often results in a mad dash to the shops and may or may not result in a purchase, but if Google has its way, your mobile device could undertake the quest for you. On Monday at New York City's Fashion Week, as reported by Digital Trends, Google announced a partnership with H&M's online Swedish fashion house Ivyrevel. The partnership aims to "bring couture into the digital age" by utilizing our data to create items such as the "Data_Dress," a custom design born out of our online habits, activities, and history. The project, dubbed "Coded Couture," requires wearers to download an Android app which catalogs their activities in order to learn about user habits. The information gathered is then used to design garments. In a press release (.PDF), the companies said the Data_Dress app will collect data over the course of a week to create the personalized garment, recording elements of your lifestyle such as where you go, where and when do you hang out and what activities you enjoy doing. The application takes advantage of Google's Snapshot API, which passively collects information including weather conditions, location, and activities such as walking or driving. As more information is collected, users can see their garments take shape. Google "It's such an exiting moment. We're about to change the fashion industry by bringing the customer's personality into the design process through data technology," said Aleksandar Subosic, co-founder of Ivyrevel. "To get a unique piece of clothing today you need to either buy a custom-made design piece or design it yourself, but that is generally not an affordable option and most people lack the design experience. The Data Dress enables women around the world to order a dress made entirely for them, that reflects the way they live their lives," the executive added. The Data_Dress will be offered at what Ivyrevel calls an "accessible" price level. The app is currently in the closed beta stage, with an expected launch date to the public later this year.

LG teases 'less artificial more intelligence' for G6 Google Assistant is available on the Pixel. Alexa is coming to the Huawei Mate 9. Sense Companion is coming on the HTC U Ultra. Samsung may be launching Bixby on the Galaxy S8. And LG may be bringing something else to the G6. By Matthew Miller for Smartphones and Cell Phones | February 9, 2017 -- 16:31 GMT (08:31 PST) | Topic: Mobility Google Now was the default assistant for Android phones in 2016 and matched up well with Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. The launch of Google Assistant on the Pixel phones seems to have opened the floodgates for advanced intelligence and machine learning on Android smartphones. The Huawei Mate 9 is now available in the US for just $599 and will soon receive an update that brings Amazon Alexa to work in combination with the integrated machine learning already found in the Mate 9. special feature How to Implement AI and Machine Learning The next wave of IT innovation will be powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. We look at the ways companies can take advantage of it and how to get started. Read More The HTC U Ultra and Play devices will be coming in a month or so and include HTC Sense Companion. We haven't seen Sense Companion in action yet, but understand HTC built upon Google Now while including intelligence to learn your lifestyle over time. Samsung confirmed it will include an artificial intelligence digital assistant on the Galaxy S8. It has had S Voice on devices for years, but that assistant lacked intelligence and performance was often lagging. After acquiring Viv Labs last year, I'm sure we will see a much better product in Bixby. LG sent along the teaser image above to promote the LG G6. There are rumors it could include Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, with CNET even speculating it may contain both. The teaser states that the AI will be brought to you first by LG, which may mean it is the first non-Google phone with Google Assistant. LG may beat Huawei to the release of Amazon Alexa -- since we don't yet have a timeline for Alexa on the Mate 9. With the statement of more intelligence being made, having both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant makes sense. While these two offer voice assistance, they could be made to complement each other as Alexa has defined skills while Google Assistant is more open and conversational. I am excited to see our smartphones doing more heavy lifting and helping us become more efficient. Given that the internal specs, camera performance, battery life, large screen design, and more have all reached near parity, the wave of artificial intelligence may be what helps you pick one phone over another.

One user found a new section within the Assistant settings panel for “Home Control”.

Some of the devices that are compatible with this new feature are from the following companies: Nest Philips Hue Honeywell SmartThings WeMo The tip provided to Android Police stated that the device was running the Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta, with version 6.2.19 of the Google App, and version 10.2.98 of Google Play Services.

Today, the voice interface on the Pixel is finally gaining the ability to control smart devices, with ‘Home control’ beginning to widely rollout. Home control for the Pixel was announced last month alongside major Assistant integrations with Belkin, Wemo, and Honeywell. In addition to those two product lines, users will now be able to control Nest, Philips Hue, and Samsung SmartThings from the Assistant on their phone. Familiar voice commands already working with Google Home should fully translate over to the Pixel, giving users the ability to set the temperature, control lights, and other gadgets. Heading to the Assistant’s settings in the Google app should reveal a brand new Home control section. Tabs show users their list of paired devices, as well as set-up rooms. Tapping the FAB will allow you to add new devices in a process similar to Google Home. The feature is live on two of our Pixel devices running Android 7.1.2, Google Play Services 10.2.98, and the latest beta of the Google app (6.12.19). Incidentally, Assistant’s ‘What can you do?’ section has yet to list this new functionality.

One of these watches is the Polar M600. Now, Polar has announced the addition of indoor swimming metrics for this fitness-focused smartwatch with the coming update… In addition to the many updates that come with Android Wear 2.0 like the Google Assistant, the Google Play Store, a revamped user interface, and more, Polar is including new indoor swimming metrics. These will include the ability to track the distance and pace of your swim, your strokes per minute, and how many strokes you were able to take within the length of the pool. Even more amazingly, the M600 will also be able to determine which type of stroke you were performing while swimming in an indoor pool. Polar is known for its fitness accessories and trackers, and the M600 is no exception as it was built to be a dedicated fitness wearable first and foremost. The smartwatch features a 1.3-inch display, 4GB of storage, and supposedly up to 48 hours of battery life. What makes it great for exercise-related activities is its built-in heart rate sensor and GPS. If you’re interested in picking up a Polar M600 for yourself, the Android Wear-powered fitness smartwatch is available for purchase in Charcoal Black and Powder White for $329.95. You can read the full press release below: KEMPELE, FINLAND – Feb. 9, 2017 – Polar, the leader in wearable sports technology, introduces Android Wear™ 2.0 compatibility and indoor swimming metrics to their Polar M600 smartwatch.

How To Make The Most Of Valentine’s Day With Android For Couples Polar M600 Will Get Android Wear 2.0, Improved Battery Life February 9, 2017 - Written By Alexander Maxham On Wednesday, Google finally launched Android Wear 2.0, the largest update to the platform since it launched in 2014. Many of the current Android Wear smartwatches are getting the update, including the Polar M600. Now the company is also confirming that not only will their smartwatch get the update soon, but it’ll also get a few more goodies, like better battery life. Polar says that the M600 will now last around 36 hours. Likely not a huge improvement for most people, seeing as it’s not two full days, most users will charge nightly anyways. The Polar M600 is the only Android Wear smartwatch that can track your swimming and other under water exercises. This is the best Android Wear smartwatch for fitness tracking, and that’s largely because Polar is already great at creating fitness trackers and smartwatches, so it makes plenty of sense. With Android Wear 2.0, you’ll get the Google Assistant on your wrist, as well as Android Pay built into the watch. However, the Polar M600 does not have NFC connectivity, so Android Pay won’t be available on the Polar M600, but it will be available on newer smartwatches. The update also allows users to download apps straight from the Google Play Store on their wrist, instead of downloading it on their phone and then using it on their smartwatch. Additionally, Polar is bringing more languages to the M600, these include Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Turkish and Vietnamese. Polar has not confirmed when the update will be available for the M600, other than “soon”. Reports have stated that the update will be heading out on February 15th, so we could see it available for the M600 around then. If you haven’t picked up the Polar M600 yet, you can still grab one for $329.95. It’s one of the more expensive Android Wear smartwatches, but this is a really good fitness tracking smartwatch, far better than most of the others on the market. You can pick up different straps for the Polar M600 for about $29.95 each, unfortunately, it doesn’t use traditional watch straps. The band is a silicon one, so it’s not as nice looking as the ones available for the Moto 360, Fossil Q Founder and others.

 The man who brought Google Street View to the world is now leading engineering at Lyft Biz Carson Feb. 9, 2017, 12:00 PM 1,396 facebook linkedin twitter email print Luc Vincent Lyft About a decade ago, Google cofounder Larry Page handed Luc Vincent a task. The Frenchman was to oversee a collaboration with Stanford University on a seemingly preposterous new project. Vincent initially toiled on the task during his 20% time — Google's famous system that allows employees to work on side projects — but the effort soon occupied more than just 20% of his time and turned into one of Google's most famous products: Google Street View. "That was a fun time at Google. We were small, probably about the same size as Lyft today," Vincent told Business Insider. After 12 years at the search giant, Vincent has left the company and joined ride-hailing company Lyft as its VP of Engineering, having started on Monday. He will oversee the marketplace and mapping teams and report to Lyft's VP of Engineering, Peter Morelli. His experience in mapping — and its crucial function to ride-hailing apps — is a big boost to Lyft, which hasn't invested as heavily as its competitor Uber in building out its own systems.  While at Google, Vincent oversaw everything from how to strap cameras onto backpacks to putting the cameras on satellites in order to map the world. While Lyft doesn't have plans to introduce mapping cars (or satellites for that matter) anytime soon, Vincent said even things like knowing which way the car is facing on the map for effective routes are mapping and marketplace challenges.  And while he's excited to bring his decade plus experience at one of the top mapping teams in the globe to Lyft, working for a company that's looking to transform the globe in a new way appealed to Vincent the most.  "I like the fact that it’s not only a great business, but something that will do good for the world," Vincent said. " If we are smart about it, through the kind of services that Lyft can provide, I think we can help people’s lives really broadly."

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 9, 2017 at 11:00AM One of the many interesting details revealed in Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with relatively equal payments scheduled for every year. Snap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs increase considerably, up $192 million for the year. Image Source: Getty Google's cloud service competes against the larger Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch up to the competition. What does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud? Alphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item, which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play likely accounts for the bulk of revenue. The cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer. While Google has made several advancements in its cloud services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run rate at $3 billion as of last quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations. Google still needs to diversify The growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but there's still more work to do. On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, "We have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms." Snap can take advantage of at least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was willing to lock down a long-term contract. At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its own servers. Snap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing, management notes, "In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers." If Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google. What this means for Snap Snap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last year. It also means that switching service providers will be difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years even costlier. On the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340 million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make the most of its spend. Overall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the company to Google for a long time. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

This includes apps that lack a privacy policy. Developers can fix this by including a link to a valid privacy policy on the app’s store listing page and within the app. Developers can also opt-out of this requirement by removing requests for sensitive permission or user data such as camera, microphone, accounts, contacts, or phone. If such permissions are requested, then developers need to make sure the information is handled over encrypted channels like HTTPS. The need for a privacy policy needs to be resolved by the 15th of March 2017, post which Google will take action against offending apps. This is an important step by Google, and will help curb developers offhandedly ignoring having privacy policies, while asking for various permissions from a user’s phone. It will also help reduce the number of apps that are simply hacked together to replicate functions of a more popular app. Developers that ignore privacy policies open themselves up to lawsuits, as such, the quality and security of apps on the Play Store should also improve. This move is also important in light of Google launching Android Wear 2.0 with support for Google Play. Other than the new policy, Google imposes various other restrictions on developers, which unless followed, can earn a Play Store suspension. Our guide on the 20 common app developer mistakes that lead to Google Play suspension can be found here.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Feb 9, 2017, 12:00pm EST share tweet Linkedin Luc Vincent, senior director of engineering at Google, has been hired by Lyft to lead the ride-hail company’s maps and marketplace division. He is the latest Google Maps engineer to migrate to the world of ride-sharing, where many companies are staffing up their mapping divisions in the interest of making the art of connecting rider and driver as precise as possible. Luc Vincent While at the search giant, Vincent helped pioneer Google Maps’ wildly popular Street View, which provides panoramic views of many of the world’s roads. At Lyft, Vincent said he will be helping the ride-hail company “rethink” transportation. That includes improving dispatch, pick-ups and drop-offs, and helping drivers get to where they need to go more precisely. “People think Lyft’s mission is to just be a more efficient taxi company,” Vincent told The Verge. “But it’s really about rethinking transportation, rethinking how we move people and interact with the environment of the car. I think they can perceive the problems, they’re going very fast, they’re going after a giant market, and they can really make a difference in the world. So that’s why I decided to make a move.” Vincent will work with Lyft’s VP of engineering, Peter Morelli, and chief technology officer, Chris Lambert, to staff up the company’s engineering division. This could be essential as Lyft’s president said recently that a “majority” of its rides will take place in self-driving cars by 2021. “We are actively thinking about our next move there,” Vincent said about self-driving cars. “And the fact that Logan [Green] and John [Zimmer, Lyft’s co-founders] are soldiers in this and think that it’s going to be critical to the future is probably why I decided to come here.” Lyft’s work on self-driving cars “is probably why I decided to come here,” Vincent says Lyft’s main rival, Uber, caught some flack recently after asking users permission to collect location data even when they are not using the app. This includes tracking riders five minutes after their trip ends, and even when the app is in the background of a customer’s smartphone. Lyft does not track its users after a trip ends, but Vincent said he’d be open to more expansion of location services if it improved trips. “If it improves the process, which is the primary goal, we should think about ways to do it,” he said. A Lyft spokesperson added that the company does not collect data when the app is off and has no immediate plans to do otherwise. Vincent is a major score for Lyft, considering many of Google’s engineering experts have gone to work for Uber. A few weeks ago, Amit Singhal, the former Google engineer who helped perfect the search engine’s ranking algorithm, went to work for Uber as senior vice president of engineering. He joined Manik Gupta, the former head of Google Maps product division, and Brian McClendon, who once ran Google’s entire mapping division. It comes at the same time that Uber is pumping $500 million into building a map of the entire world, a crucial step toward using autonomous vehicles.

This means that Android smartwatch wearers will be able to run the Strava app directly on the watch without having to carry their phones, provided that the watch has the right sensor set. The update comes just a day after Google’s newest smartwatches, made in conjunction with LG, went on sale. (The Verge’s full review can be found here.) The two new smartwatches are said to improve on the fitness-tracking features that were present in earlier Android Wear smartwatches — especially the $349 Watch Sport, which has built-in GPS and LTE capabilities. The watch defaults to Google’s own fitness-tracking app for most activities, but now Strava is an option as well. Strava works on other smartwatches, too, but usually requires the phone Strava has worked as a wearable app or "applet" on earlier smartwatch models, but in almost all instances users would have to carry their smartphones too, since Strava is dependent on GPS. It’s also worth noting that Strava is coming to Android Wear 2.0 before it’s fully optimized for Apple Watch Series 2; the company says an updated version of the app for Apple Watch is coming sometime in "early 2017." Strava is a San Francisco-based app-maker that over the past has gained a kind of cult following among competitive athletes (or those who fancy themselves athletes) over the past several years, though it’s unclear exactly how many users the app has at this point. It’s one of the few popular health and fitness apps that has remained independent in recent years, as competitors like RunKeeper, Runtastic, and MapMyRun have all been acquired by large apparel makers.

When mobile game Pokémon GO launched last summer, there was barely a fresh faced youngster – or older geek – not engrossed in the chase and capture of the virtual critters. Love it, hate it or not really care one way or the other, it was still an online sensation that took the gaming world by storm. Few fans, of course, would have paused for a second to consider the technology that enabled such a worldwide phenomenon to launch, grow – largely without major hiccups – and adapt to the massive and sudden explosion of users. It’s likely that even fewer in the business community would have considered how similar behind the scenes tech could be employed to help transform the way their own data travels, is stored and develops. Yet Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which fuelled the online game’s massive growth, as well as other cloud-based storage platforms and services are bringing opportunities to tech savvy businesses, regardless of size and type. Blue sky thinking Some of the world’s most familiar business names – from Pokémon GO’s developers Niantic to holiday home rental go-between Airbnb, music host Spotify to entertainment giant Netflix – have flourished thanks to using cloud based platforms. As small start-ups, they took advantage of being able to instantly access powerful servers whenever they needed to, without the financial hit of having to invest in their own costly servers. And as global giants, they now take advantage of their cloud providers’ massive storage facilities, confident of its security and that as technology screeches ahead, they won’t be left behind. Many now insist that the cloud model works so well, they wouldn’t dream of swapping it. Businesses and organisations across the globe have ditched rooms full of costly servers in favour of using Google Cloud Platform’s virtual machines to serve and build new websites, develop apps, store data and analyse results. So how can it work for everyone else? Power to the people Cloud computing has evolved from being just somewhere to file a document or store your family photo album. Today the likes of Google Cloud Platform comes equipped with a wide range of services including machine learning and networking services, big data solutions, access to powerful virtual machines and security add-ons. It has already transformed the way large corporations and organisations operate, launched start-ups on the road to global domination and given even the smallest sole trader access to the kind of tech they might never have been able to afford to own. The benefits can be stripped down to four key elements: Scalability: Using a cloud platform means being able to scale up when you need extra fire power – such as an ecommerce firm might need during the Christmas rush – and wind back when there’s less demand. Reliability: Embracing Google Cloud Platform, for example, means tapping into one of the world’s most robust infrastructures. Already capable of supporting more than 100bn Google searches per month, it already delivers a range of services to hundreds of millions of users with almost flawless availability. Security: A key concern for many yet cloud platform services have been adopted by governments and global businesses. Google Cloud Platform data is stored in clusters of data centres – information can be replicated across three centres – with each protected by multi-layers of security. Given that a fire could wipe out your office based servers in seconds, a cloud-based platform guarantees it’s business as usual. Cost-effective: No more clunky machinery to buy, service and upgrade, a cloud based platform means less immediate outlay for small start-ups, the benefits of extra fire power when needed so you can cut down the ‘rent’ when you don’t, access to a more agile and responsive way of working and reliability which means less outlay for specialist support. Future proof your business Failing to embrace the potential of a cloud based platform could be costly. Diane Greene, Senior Vice President, Google Cloud recently warned: “Over the next five years, businesses of every kind will be transformed by smart data, analytics, machine learning and digital communications. “What is going to differentiate business in the future is digital technology.” Cloud Technology Solutions is Google’s only cloud Premier Partner in Scotland.

South Korean electronics megalith Samsung has filed a trademark for “Samsung Hello” with the European Intellectual Property Office, and the description implies that it has something to do with serving information at a glance. Google Now, for the uninitiated, is an intelligent assistant that uses signals like geographic location, time of day, search history, and emails in order to make recommendations and predictions. It tracks your flights, stocks, and packages in transit, serves up event reminders and sports updates, monitors the local weather forecast, and keeps track of traffic and transit data. And it lets third-party developers serve up other info. It launched as part of version 4.1 of Google’s mobile Android operating system, and later came to iOS as part of an update to the Google app. More: Samsung may name its voice assistant “Bixby,” and debut it on the Galaxy S8 Samsung’s take on a contextual assistant sounds similar, in some ways. The patent describes the eponymous Samsung Hello as “software that will enable block users or computers and mobile devices to access, aggregate, organize, and interact with content, information, and images and topics of general interest to such users,” and that “[gives] personalized features and information on user’s preferences in the fields of weather, music, entertainment, games, travel, science, health, contact, and social news via voice command and voice recognition.” Samsung isn’t the first to follow in the footsteps of Google’s AI efforts. Taiwanese phone maker HTC took the wraps off BlinkFeed, a so-called social aggregator, alongside the HTC One M8. It tied together social network updates from Facebook, Instagram, and Yelp, news from ESPN MTV, and Fitbit, and other bite-sized informational tidbits into a single chronological stream. And like Google Now, developers can tap into BlinkFeed to serve up notifications. More: Samsung Galaxy S8 rumors and news leaks It’s unclear just how integral a role Samsung Hello will play in future Samsung devices, though. Google Now is a native feature of the Android operating system, but Samsung’s assistant might launch in the form of an optional add-on for owners of current and future Samsung smartphones and tablets. Or it might be a piece of a larger AI puzzle. A growing body of evidence suggests that Samsung’s next phone will feature a holistic assistant called Bixby, a name which the company trademarked earlier this year. It’ll reportedly be capable of identifying objects within images and tie into third-party apps to help automatically make purchases and place orders, and is said to be deeply ingrained in a forthcoming version of Samsung’s operating system.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A How to Tackle the 4Ws of Marketing Content Creation With Data by Lux Narayan  |   February 9, 2017  |  1,878 views Tweet Kindle Email Top As with most undertakings, before you begin writing or otherwise creating content, you should ask yourself some stock questions: why, what, when, and where—the 4Ws of content creation. And because creating marketing content is as much science as it is art, the most powerful weapon you have at your disposal is data. So, before you start working on your next piece of content, consider the 4Ws. Also keep in mind how you can use data to resolve the concerns you should be addressing with each question. 1. Why write/create content In marketing, visibility is key. After you develop a product or service that addresses a gap in the market, how do you reach your target audience? Say, for instance, you are a pet-care startup in Houston. When a pet owner googles "dog-grooming Houston" and your website or blog does not come up in search results, you need to worry. You need to get the word out, and to do that you need content. Your website or blog must remain active and fresh. Search engines rank pages with fresher and dynamic content higher. That doesn't mean you must continually create new content; updating older content is viewed as staying fresh in the eyes of Google. Apart from SEO reasons, content can help present your brand as if it were a person with a voice customers can relate to. Want to see what the content of a relatable brand looks like? Just follow Innocent Drinks on Facebook. All that to say... before you start working on a piece of content, ask yourself why—define the result you hope to achieve with your content. In SEO terms, that purpose has to do with being found online for the product or service you offer. For example, when I look up "remodel my kitchen," this article is one of the top results. It addresses pain points and concerns. So use Google Analytics data to determine which terms customers are searching for when they land on your website looking for answers to help resolve their "pain." Also conduct keyword research to see how well you're ranking for relevant search terms vs. your competitors. That data will help you come up with answers for the why of creating a specific piece of content. That leads us to the next W. 2. What to write Using the insights you get from Google Analytics and other keyword research, work toward creating content that features the keywords people search for. Google's Keyword Planner will help you with keyword research. Using historical data, you can keep track of search volume. Predicted clicks and estimated conversions can be invaluable in creating an effective content strategy (and in justifying your budget). Check BuzzSumo for articles that feature the relevant search terms to see what content works. BuzzSumo arranges content in the order of the number of shares it received on Social Media. This will give you a good idea of what kind of content works. Analyze the performance of your brand pages and accounts on social media. By assessing which of your content works best there, you can deliver consistently. You should also benchmark your performance to know what type of content works best in your industry. 3. When to write/post/publish You need to put out content as regularly as the kind of content and the platform you place it on demand. For instance, Twitter analytics tools can tell you whether you are being too spammy or you aren't posting as frequently as you should. You can also find out the time of the day that gets you most engagement. If you were the social media manager of McDonalds, for example, you'd want to know how much engagement your Tweets fetch depending on the time of the day. Here's that info for the three-month period from June to August 2016: Clearly, you get great levels of engagement between 9 PM and 12 AM. With this insight, you might decide to tweet more during that time and cut down on tweets between 12 PM and 3 PM. Social media scheduling tools offered by platforms such as HubSpot, Hootsuite, and Buffer can all suggest the time of the day you get most engagement. Also keep an eye out for "holidays" that are relevant to your industry. If you are a doughnut franchise and you miss out on Doughnut Day, you'll never forgive yourself. (You should have a content calendar. It will give your content creation activities a basic structure that you can build on.) Match organization and preparedness with readiness to deliver content when it is called for. Use data to see what content is gaining traction in your industry. You can also identify available opportunities—topics that haven't received much attention from your sector, but might yield you leads or sales. Coordinate content with your sales team. You can create content that can be an asset in sales pitches and which translate to sales. 4. Where to write/post/publish While planning content, create different types (see image below) that are tailor-made both for the different audiences you plan reach and for the media and platforms you plan to use. For example, Twitter has a clear 140-character limit, but Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram all have mostly unstated conventions on how long descriptions and posts should be. The tone and strategy you adopt should also be tailored to the medium you are going to use. For example, if you are promoting your product or service, it could be OK to talk it up on your website or blog. If you are writing a guest post, however, you should be addressing a broader topic (you can probably still mention your awesome product in passing). Regarding content types, a three-tiered strategy pays off. Here's what a well-balanced content strategy might look like: You can do resource- and research-intensive posts once a year. These can talk about the key competencies of your product and should be placed within your website. Client success stories, blog posts, etc. can be published multiple times every month. Social media content has to be much more frequent. As with all marketing... monitor, monitor, monitor! Figure out what kind of content gets you the most engagement. Social media analytics can point you in the direction of the medium that works the best for you, as well. You can also discover social media networks that you aren't part of yet, but which your competitors are benefiting from. Paid content amplification is gaining a lot of traction. It is best to decide which post to put money behind based on data. Use the promoted post detection feature offered by Facebook analytics tools to understand what you stand to gain from promotion. You can identify what benefit your competitors are getting out of promotion. This, considered along with the reach and engagement that you currently get, can help you decide whether you should promote content. * * * Content creation cannot be reduced to a formula; it is still part art, after all. There is definitely no one-size-fits-all solution. However, what is common to every solution to a content crisis is that data can help provide answers. Data-driven creativity is all about making sure your content gets to the audience you have in mind—effectively.

Soon, the city of Pune will be the first city to receive “citywide” WiFi thanks to a new consortium formed between Google, Larsen & Toubro, RailTel, and IBM… Pune’s “Smart City Development Corporation” wants to put public WiFi everywhere in the city of Pune, and has enlisted the four companies in a deal worth Rs 1500 million (or roughly $22,502,250). Google’s role is of course implementing the Google Station platform, which basically provides the tools for build out the WiFi networks themselves and their management. The platform has powered the WiFi networks at a variety of rail stations up to this point, but is now expanding to other locations that have a lot of foot traffic in Pune, like universities and cafes. “The plan is to integrate all public places on a single platform to aggregate WiFi hotspots that will allow access with one-time authentication,” Pune Municipal Commissioner Kunal Kumar told ET. According to the publication, Kumar also said that 15-20% of the revenue generated through the network will be shared with the Pune Smart City Development Corporation (PSCSCL). Google will also be instrumental in the monetization of the platform through advertisements, Srinivasan Ramamurthy from Larsen & Toubro (an IT giant in India) told ET News. “One of the important things that we are doing is Wi-Fi, and then we are also establishing the emergency call box and public drop box and environmental sensors…We are working with RailTel for connectivity and Google for putting advertisements,” Ramamurthy said. “Google will help us in monetization through advertisements.” “With the goal of creating a great Internet for the next billion users, we have found that making high-quality public Wi-Fi more easily accessible can play a critical role in bringing the benefits of Internet to millions of Indians,” a Google spokesperson told Mashable India in a statement. As of December 2016, Google’s public Wi-Fi service covers over 100 railway stations across India.

Home Industry Google India Team calls on Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal Google India Team calls on Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal The Chief Minister also asked the Google team to find out ways to augment internet penetration substantially in the rural areas and project Assam as the gateway to south east Asia. By: PTI | Updated: February 9, 2017 9:56 PM Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal PTI A delegation of Google India led by its Country Head Public Policy Chetan Krishnaswamy called on Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal today and discussed various issues for boosting the government’s efforts to realize the goal of digital Assam. The Google India team apprised the Chief Minister of several measures for enhancing use of digital medium in the operation of small business, skill development, promotion of cultural sites, supporting the eco-system and the ‘internet sarathi’ project successfully implemented in different parts of the country by the internet giant. Informing the delegation that the government gives special focus on connecting the rural masses through new technology and empowering their skills, Sonowal said keeping this in mind provisions have been made in the budget and a knowledge centre is proposed in each village of the state. The Chief Minister also asked the Google team to find out ways to augment internet penetration substantially in the rural areas and project Assam as the gateway to south east Asia.

According to The Next Web, the company began sending out emails to developers of apps that violate the Google Play Store’s User Data policy this week, warning them that their apps would be penalized or removed from the store altogether if the issues aren’t resolved promptly. Don't Miss: It looks like Google just fixed one of the Pixel’s biggest problems “Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information,” Google’s email explains. “Your app requests sensitive permissions (e.g. camera, microphone, accounts, contacts, or phone) or user data, but does not include a valid privacy policy.” If they don’t want their app to lose visibility or be taken down from the Play Store, they either have to include a link to a valid privacy policy on the Play Store listing and within the app or remove any requests for sensitive information or user data. Any developers that haven’t taken action by March 15th, 2017 (or simply aren’t able to) will have to live with whatever Google decides to do with their apps. With millions of apps crowding the Play Store, many of which have either never taken off or were abandoned years ago, this seems like a clever way to clear out the chaff and make the catalog a little less nightmarish to navigate. Providing countless developers don’t alter the permissions of their apps or throw together an acceptable privacy policy before March 15th, millions of apps could be purged.

By Alison DeNisco | February 9, 2017, 6:50 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/samxmeg More about IT Security Special report: Cyberwar and the future of cybersecurity (free ebook) Video: Top 5 ways to secure your IoT Interview with a hacker: Kapustkiy from New World Hackers Subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter Google is getting serious about app privacy. This week, the tech giant sent an email to developers across the globe, notifying them that if their apps violate the company's User Data policy regarding privacy, they may be removed from the store, as reported by The Next Web. "Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information," the email message stated. "Your app requests sensitive permissions (e.g. camera, microphone, accounts, contacts, or phone) or user data, but does not include a valid privacy policy." The message goes on to state that the developers must include a link to a valid privacy policy in their app's Store Listing page, and within the app itself as well. The privacy policy must "comprehensively disclose how your app collects, uses and shares user data, including the types of parties with whom it's shared," according to Google's User Data policy. Alternatively, developers can choose to opt out of this requirement by removing any requests for sensitive permissions or user data from the app, the message stated. SEE: Dozens of iOS apps vulnerable to data theft, despite ATS mandate Developers must meet these policy requirements by March 15, 2017. If they do not meet that deadline, they risk having Google "limit the visibility of your app," or even remove it from the Play Store, according to the email. "I think it is a great thing that Google is putting more focus on users' privacy," said Engin Kirda, professor of computer science at Northeastern University. It is especially important in light of past cases in which apps available in the Play Store collected large volumes of sensitive data from users without their knowledge, including the URLs they visited, he added. "By enforcing Google's own user data policies, and making app developers provide privacy policies, Google is trying to improve the security and safety of the app store," Kirda said. "It is a step in the right direction." Besides requiring a privacy policy, Google's User Data policy also mandates that apps that handle personal or sensitive user information handle that data securely, "including transmitting it using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS)." Google's move to protect app users from cybercrime follows Apple's move to require all iOS apps to use HTTPS connections by a yet-to-be-determined deadline. In Apple's case, once a deadline is set, app developers must enforce the App Transport Security (ATS) feature, which forces the connections to HTTPS instead of HTTP, in order to improve privacy. However, sometimes even these protections are not sufficient. A verify.ly report released this week found that 76 popular iOS apps are vulnerable to data theft, regardless of whether or not developers are using ATS. If you are an app developer, you should always make sure you have a privacy policy in place as a best practice, not just because it's required by Google or Apple. And, if you find your app disappears from the Play Store next month, you'll know why. The Next Web story notes that the coming purge of apps that lack privacy policies will likely help rid the Play Store of "zombie apps" that contain security vulnerabilities, making it easier for users to find the safe apps they need. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1. This week, Google emailed a number of developers to notify them that their apps collect sensitive user information but do not have a valid privacy policy, and if they do not add one, the app may be removed from the Play Store. 2. If an app requests sensitive permissions, such as camera, microphone, accounts, or user data, its privacy policy must disclose how it collects, uses and shares user data, including the types of parties with whom it's shared, according to Google's User Data policy. 3. Google's move is meant to increase user security; however, app developers should be vigilant about security protections whether or not they are required by a provider.

Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0 View All Posts After delaying the release for months, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) finally launched Android Wear 2.0, the new version of its smartwatch operating system. Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership with LG, the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch. Source: Google Here’s what you need to know. Google knows it didn’t exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as though Apple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas. That has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look. Android Wear 2.0 Key Features Google was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided to delay it to this spring. The official announcement landed yesterday afternoon on GOOGL’s blog. What did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone. Key features Google is showing off include: Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit app LTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphone Google Assistant is integrated Customizable watch face components Google Play access direct from smartwatch Support for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crown In particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices — with no need to be connected to a smartwatch — means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: Google The 6 best new features of Android Wear 2.0 Mike Wehner @MikeWehner February 8th, 2017 at 3:36 PM Share Tweet Smartwatches have had a rough go of it in their relatively short lives thus far. Sure, the Apple Watch sold well enough that people don’t consider it a total disaster, and enough Android Wear watches are floating around that it seems like at least a few people care, but they’ve hardly been the runaway success that some thought they would be. Always ready for a challenge, Google is doing its best to reinvent its smartwatch platform with the Android Wear 2.0 update, which is finally rolling out after being teased and tested for months. Here’s why it’s a big deal, even if you don’t own a smartwatch (yet). It’s faster than ever Okay, so this is an obvious one, but Android Wear 2.0 makes navigating the interface and launching apps much quicker than it’s been in the past. It still won’t rival your smartphone in terms of boot-up time — that can still take a while, unfortunately — but on-the-go interactions with the watch are now noticeably less bogged down with waiting screens and loading bars. Google Assistant Google Assistant is one of the slickest AI assistants around, so having it on your wrist is pretty much ideal. It works via the same “Ok Google” voice command as it does elsewhere, and can create lists, calendar notifications, and grab directions without having to tap through any menus. Revamped complications Apple Watch devotees blew their collective lids when Apple showed off customizable complications for the first time, and for good reason: Having more information that you actually use on the watch face is never a bad thing. Android Wear 2.0 lets users customize their primary watch screens with calendar alerts, alarms, pedometer data, weather, and other information that requires much less digging than it ever has before. Better messaging Replying to a message without having to take your phone out of your pocket is a pretty huge benefit of owning a smartwatch, but Android Wear’s first attempt at replies was pretty lackluster. In 2.0, replies are both quicker to compose and faster to send thanks to built-in reply buttons for Android Wear-compatible apps, and Google’s handy Smart Reply feature that auto generates possibly replies for you to choose from. Smarter fit For anyone coming to an Android smartwatch from a dedicated fitness band, Google Fit was often lacking smarts. 2.0 sees Fit get a big upgrade. There’s now third party app sharing so that your favorite Android fitness app can play nice with your workout data, and the app is now smarter about knowing when you’ve started working out and when you stop, and has a much better sensor algorithm for figuring out the kind of exercise you’re actually doing, without being told. You don’t need your phone The dream of all smartwatch fans is to eventually have a device that doesn’t even need to be connected to a phone in order to do everything you need it to. Android Wear 2.0 lays the groundwork for that future with support for WiFi and LTE. However, since almost all current Android smartwatches don’t have LTE capabilities — LG’s new Watch Sport is leading the charge in this regard — taking advantage of this feature requires that you invest in an entirely new watch. Still, it’s a promising sign of things to come.

First reported by The Verge, the move was confirmed by Google in a statement: “Music is very important to Google and we’re evaluating how to bring together our music offerings to deliver the best possible product for our users, music partners and artists. Nothing will change for users today and we’ll provide plenty of notice before any changes are made.” While not part of the announcement, combining at least the Google Play Music and YouTube Music apps would seem a likely next move. Streaming competition is only increasing, including a likely music expansion by Facebook. So merging Google Play Music and You Tube Music, neither of which has gained major traction, into a single app would help them compete.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 9, 2017 at 11:00AM One of the many interesting details revealed in Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with relatively equal payments scheduled for every year. Snap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs increase considerably, up $192 million for the year. Image Source: Getty Google's cloud service competes against the larger Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch up to the competition. What does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud? Alphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item, which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play likely accounts for the bulk of revenue. The cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer. While Google has made several advancements in its cloud services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run rate at $3 billion as of last quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations. Google still needs to diversify The growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but there's still more work to do. On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, "We have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms." Snap can take advantage of at least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was willing to lock down a long-term contract. At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its own servers. Snap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing, management notes, "In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers." If Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google. What this means for Snap Snap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last year. It also means that switching service providers will be difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years even costlier. On the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340 million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make the most of its spend. Overall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the company to Google for a long time. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

With all the hype surrounding Google Fiber and its competitors, will we look back on the whole experiment as a colossal waste of resources or a long overdue harbinger of better internet? By Jason Hiner | February 5, 2017 -- 23:00 GMT (15:00 PST) | Topic: Networking Image: Google If you're a telecommuter, an entrepreneur, or a technology lover, and fiber broadband is coming to your area, then you're likely chomping at the bit to get it installed as soon as it's available. I know I am. Since Google Fiber named my city as fertile ground for gigabit broadband, other internet providers like AT&T have raced to match Google with ridiculously fast internet plans of their own. FREE DOWNLOAD Special Report: Harnessing IoT in the Enterprise You can download all of the articles in this series in one PDF. It's free to registered ZDNet and TechRepublic members. Read More Google Fiber has succeeded in reigniting competition for faster internet across the US. However, now that Google Fiber has reached a similar conclusion as Verizon FiOS did a decade ago -- that digging expensive ditches and laying cables might be a 20th century way of solving the problem -- what's going to happen to the fiber broadband movement? For example, AT&T had been on a gigabit tear in 2016, as it increased its fiber-to-the-premises roll-outs to a total of 29 different metro areas across the US, with plans for dozens more. That compared to nine metro areas for Google Fiber in 2016, with another dozen or so on the potential list. AT&T even thumbed its nose at Google in the process. Meanwhile, cable providers like Time Warner Cable upgraded internet speeds by 6x for free to keep customers in the fold. Even smaller ISPs looked for ways to join the fiber revolution, such as CenturyLink, which reported in 2016 that it had found ways to get FTTP deployments down to $500-$800 from the tradition $1,000 or more it cost to lay fiber to each home or business. Now that Google is retreating from FTTP rollouts in favor of fixed wireless (powered by its Webpass acquisition), it's unclear yet whether its fiber competitors will lose their enthusiasm for FTTP. Since Google chased out the Google Fiber CEO and laid off 9 percent of its staff last fall, AT&T has gone very quiet about its Fiber plans. Instead, it's been touting its 5G trials and its new "AirGig" technology to deliver gigabit internet over power lines. Telecom companies are naturally questioning whether they should continue these laborious, expensive deployments of fiber when wireless gigabit is only a few years away. So-called "fixed wireless" replaces a cable or fiber modem with a box that has a wireless chip like the one in your smartphone plus a strong antenna. Once 5G arrives, these boxes will be able to operate at gigabit speeds -- with no new ditches to dig and no cables to lay. At the same time, Elon Musk's SpaceX is planning a global network of 4,000 low-orbit satellites that would blanket the entire planet with gigabit internet. If approved, SpaceX said these satellites would offer low latency in the neighborhood of 30ms, which is comparable to today's cable and DSL connections and much faster than the 600ms that has plagued traditional satellite internet providers. SpaceX wants to start launching these satellites in 2019. Qualcomm, Boeing, Virgin, and others are considering similar plans for satellite internet. Another factor to watch is DOCSIS 3.1, the cable internet standard that allows cable companies to offer gigabit speeds over existing cable lines. Since cable already reaches over 60 percent of US households, this could also mean a massive upgrade to gigabit speeds in the years ahead. Comcast, America's largest cable internet provider, has already started rolling out gigabit cable upgrades. With all this in mind, what's the advantage of gigabit fiber? Top notch fiber connections have much lower latency than any other type of connection -- as low as 2ms. That opens up new possibilities for telepresence, team collaboration, and virtual reality and augmented reality over the internet. The other big advantage to fiber over wireless, satellites, power lines, or upgraded cable lines is that it's much more future-proof. While we're racing toward 1 gigabit speeds by 2020, by 2025-2030 we're going to be demanding 10 gigabits. Fiber will find it much easier to scale up to meet that demand than these other types of connections will. SEE: Harnessing IoT in the Enterprise (ZDNet/TechRepublic special report) In short, when these other technologies catch up to fiber broadband's gigabit speeds in the next few years it will lull us into thinking that the telecom companies that spent a fortune on FTTP only ended up with a short-term advantage of 2-3 years. But make no mistake, the companies that are investing in FTTP today are likely to be the leaders in 2025 when the next wave of technologies -- especially artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and mixed reality -- will demand much more robust connections from both the home and the office. It's also going to be critical to the future of the smart home and the smart city, since many of today's most connected cities across the world have determined that laying fiber is the foundation that many of tomorrow's most connected services will be built upon. The big question is whether Google Fiber, AT&T Fiber, Verizon FiOS, or any of their competitors will have the stomach to stay the course on FTTP.

And sometimes it feels a bit sluggish. Fortunately, these problems are easy to fix. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 6, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) | Topic: Cloud Is your Google Chrome browser feeling a little slower than it once did? Or are you finding that it's consuming a lot of your system's RAM and making your PC feel slower than it should? Here are some tips to help you make Google Chrome fast again, and to reduce the amount of RAM the browser eats up. Note: These tips work for both Mac and Windows (and many even work for Linux!). #1: Update your Google Chrome browser If you've not closed Google Chrome in a while -- probably because you've got a whole bunch of tabs you're keeping open -- then perhaps there's an update waiting for you. You can easily tell if there's an update on later releases of Chrome because the menu button (the three vertical dots right of the address bar) will change from green to yellow and then red to give you a visual reminder of how out-of-date the browser you are running is. To force Chrome to check for an update type chrome://help into the address bar and follow the prompts. #2: Get rid of unwanted extensions Type chrome://extensions into the address bar and disable any unwanted extensions. Either uncheck the box to disable the extension or click on the trash can icon to delete it. Note that if you delete an extension you lose all the data associated with it (this does not happen if you disable it) #3: Get rid of unwanted plugins Type chrome://plugins into the address bar and disable any unwanted plugins. Just click the link to disable. #4: Control tabs with custom extensions The amount of tabs you have open at any one time has a direct impact on the performance of Chrome, as well as how much RAM the application consumes. Fortunately, it's possible to have a lot of tabs open and keep memory consumption under control with some extensions. Here are some for you to choose from: Tab Wrangler One Tab The Great Suspender Another thing you can do is strip the page down to just the text using an extension such as Text Mode or Minimalist. There are a lot of awesome Google Chrome extensions out there. I've listed a few in the gallery below (although I don't recommend that you install all of them!). Best Google Chrome productivity, privacy... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 64 NEXT PREV #5: Install the Data Saver extension If your problem is related more to a poor internet connection than it is to a sluggish browser, then one way you can help improve bandwidth is to install the Google Data Saver extension. This extension uses the Google servers to compress and optimize web pages before they are delivered to your browser. #6: Close your browser! You really don't have to have your browser running the whole time! Really, you don't. You can customize Google Chrome to reopen exactly where you were when you closed it. Type chrome://settings and under On startup you'll see three options: Open the New Tab page Continue where you left off Open a specific page or set of pages If you want Google Chrome to fire up where you left it, choose Continue where you left off, or if you want to start up from a custom set of pages, choose Open a specific page or set of pages and select those pages. One word of caution -- be careful if you have multiple browser windows open, because only the tabs from the last window you closed will be reopened. Tip: If you accidentally close a tab, you can recover it by pressing Ctrl + Shift + T on Windows or Linux, or ⌘ + Shift + T on a Mac. #7: Run with the default theme You can do a lot of customizing of Google Chrome, including changing the theme. However, themes eat RAM, so if you want the speediest possible browser, run with the default theme. Type chrome://settings and under Appearance, if the Reset to default theme button isn't greyed out then you're running a custom theme. Click the button to go back to the default. #8: Smoother scrolling Type chrome://flags into the address bar and find Enable fast tab/windows close. This option speeds up Chrome by allowing it to close windows separate to any JavaScript code that might be running. After you've made changes click the RELAUNCH NOW button at the bottom of the screen to apply the setting. Note that this is an experimental feature and be sure to read the warnings at the top of the settings page in Chrome. To undo any changes click the Reset all to default button. #9: Clear your cache If you're getting low on disk space then you might find Chrome will speed up if you clear the cache. Type chrome://settings/clearBrowserData into the address bar and I'd suggest choosing only the Cached images and files option. Alternatively, you can nuke everything and start with a clean slate. For best results clear items from the beginning of time. Repair tools for IT pros SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 15 NEXT PREV #10: Check your system for spyware and other junk Windows users can make use of Google's Software Removal Tool. It might also be a good idea to scan the system using something such as Malwarebyte's Anti-Malware. Mac users can check out Malwarebyte's Anti-Malware for Mac (don't believe the nonsense that Macs can't have viruses or malware -- that may have been true a decade ago, but it's not true today). Bonus: Quick Google Chrome tips One of the best ways to become a total Google Chrome power user is to learn how to control the browser using shortcut keys. You can select multiple tabs for dragging -- hold down Ctrl on Windows or ⌘ on the Mac and click on the tabs you want to select. Reopen a tab you've accidentally closed with Ctrl + Shift + T on Windows or ⌘ + Shift + T on the Mac (you can reopen up to ten previously closed tabs). You can play any media file on your computer that's supported by Google Chrome by dragging it into a browser window. Google Chrome has its own task manager -- click the menu button that lives to the right of the address bar (the button with the three vertical dots), go to More Tools and then choose Task Manager. You can use the spacebar to scroll down a webpage, and you can scroll back up by pressing Shift + Spacebar. You know that T-Rex Google Chrome shows you when you lose connection to the internet (you can access the page by going to chrome://network-error/-106 )? If you press the spacebar the T-Rex will jump and kick off a simple game where you have to jump over cacti, Mario-style.

February 9 would have been the 163rd birthday of Jacobs, who was born in the Netherlands in 1854 and grew up to blaze a trail in women’s rights and achievements. “Today, on what would’ve been Jacobs’ 163rd birthday, we celebrate all that she did to pave the way for those who came after her,” wrote Google, which processes more than 3.5 billion searches a day. The daughter of a doctor, she yearned to enter the medical profession at a time when women in her village were not even allowed to attend high school. She studied independently, passed the assistant chemist exam in 1870, petitioned the University of Groningen for permission to attend classes on medicine in 1871 and became the first female in the Netherlands to study medicine and to obtain a medical degree, which she did in 1879. As a doctor she fought her colleagues to make contraceptives more widely available and set up the first birth control clinic in the world. According to Wikipedia, she helped the inventor of the contraceptive diaphragm to improve the device significantly. Aletta Jacobs, a pioneering Dutch Jewish woman, recognized on a Google doodle, February 9, 2017. (Youtube screenshot) She opened her practice doors twice a week to poor women and also worked to improve the conditions of salesgirls. In 1903, she left her medical practice to campaign for the right of women to vote, which was finally granted in 1919. In that year, she co-founded the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. Aletta Jacobs died in the Netherlands in August 1929.

But that’s about to change. Google has been sending out notices to developers across the world, explaining that it will limit their apps’ visibility, or remove them from the store completely if they violate the company’s User Data policy. For most of the affected apps, the warning is related to their lack of a privacy policy. Google’s note states that developers have to provide a valid privacy policy when their apps request or handle sensitive user or device information. Devs must include a link to a privacy policy on their apps’ store page and within the apps themselves. These policies disclose how the app collects, uses and shares user data. Additionally, all user data must be handled securely, which includes transmission using modern cryptography such as HTTPS. Google’s actions could potentially see millions of apps removed from its store, including numerous “zombie apps” - those applications that never get downloaded enough to make it into the charts, meaning users have to search for them specifically. Many rarely get updated, leaving them incompatible with newer versions of Android. As noted by TNW, a lack of motivation or even technical know-how could see many developers fail to comply with the demands, especially if the apps aren’t performing well, leading to their removal from the store. App developers have until March 15 to add the privacy policies.

 We're witnessing the slow-motion collapse of the smartwatch Steve Kovach Feb. 8, 2017, 3:45 PM 45,833 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson After several months of delays, an overhaul of its original vision, and some wrangling of hardware partners, Google's new smartwatch software, Android Wear 2.0, launches this week. But it comes after months of dour headlines for smartwatches and wearable gadgets. Tech geeks may hyperventilate over the newest wrist computer, but it's becoming apparent that most people are increasingly skeptical of the category. Pebble, the startup darling that was credited with popularizing the concept of a modern smartwatch, was forced to shut down after poor sales and sell itself to Fitbit at a major loss. Fitbit, despite its popularity, has had its own struggles, laying off 6% of its employees after disappointing holiday sales. Apple greatly pared down the capabilities of the Apple Watch, instead focusing the software on fitness-tracking and app notifications. Jawbone hasn't released a new product in nearly two years and has stopped selling devices altogether as it prepares to release a clinical-grade health tracker. And several of Google's most important Android Wear partners, such as Samsung, Motorola, and Huawei, have essentially abandoned Google's software. (Motorola, once a marquee Android Wear partner, had the strongest opposition to the operating system, citing a lack of "broad appeal" for smartwatches.) What you're witnessing is the slow-motion collapse of the smartwatch. The category will morph into something else, but it will ultimately fail to live up to the promise of being a new kind of computing platform that frees us from the smartphone. The LG Watch Sport and Style. The first two watches running Android Wear 2.0.Google Android Wear 2.0, which will debut this week on two new smartwatches made by LG and roll out to a handful of existing Android watches soon, is something of a reset for Google's smartwatch ambitions. Like we saw with the Apple Watch last year, many features have been dialed back in Android Wear to focus on a handful of activities such as messaging and fitness tracking. I've been testing one of those watches: the $349 LG Watch Sport. It's a heavy and chunky monstrosity that's tough for me to recommend to just about anyone. But the hardware isn't the whole story. This is a make-or-break moment for Google's smartwatch experiment, and I'm not confident it's going to work. Google is making a weak case for Android Wear. It's not building its own products, instead relying on fashion brands like Michael Kors and Fossil to carry the torch. This is despite Google's increased investment in excellent hardware, like the new Pixel phone and Home connected speaker that are designed to push the Android ecosystem forward. A member of the Android Wear team told me last week that the reason Google isn't making its own smartwatch is because Google sees smartwatches as more of an open ecosystem driven by personal style, so it wants to let in as many partners as possible. That's one way to look at it. The other way to look at it is Google sees the same writing on the wall that many of its other partners have, and time is running out to prove Wear is a viable platform. Instead of investing resources in building its own smartwatch, it put more of the burden on its partner LG. (Google did say Android Wear is gaining momentum, with holiday activations up 70% from the year before, but it declined to provide hard numbers. Take that stat with a healthy dose of skepticism.) Hollis Johnson The most recent data doesn't help Google's case either. According to a new report published this week by the research firm Canalys, 49% of smartwatches sold in 2016 were made by Apple, followed by Fitbit at 17% and Samsung at 15%. None of Google's Android Wear partners even made the list; they were lumped into the "other" category. I stand by what I said a few months ago: People don't want smartwatches. They want an Apple Watch or a basic fitness tracker like a Fitbit. After several days with the LG Watch Sport, I don't see anything in Android Wear that could turn things around. While Android Wear has been cleaned up and streamlined quite a bit — read my colleague Avery Hartmans' review for more details — there's no killer feature that makes me confident in the platform's longevity. It's just another smartwatch, the latest attempt to force a product category people don't need or want. The only glimmers of hope I found were in the fitness app's ability to track reps while you lift weights or perform other strength exercises like sit-ups. I haven't seen a fitness tracker do that yet, and it could turn into a killer feature for the category. The watch also has a 4G connection, so you can stream music directly to the device. Pair it with a set of Bluetooth headphones, and you can leave your phone at home while you work out. I have a feeling this is closer to what future wearables will be like — not a shrunken-down smartphone you wear on your wrist. If someone made a simple fitness tracker that let me stream music and do nothing else, I'd buy it immediately. But for now, I have a feeling Android Wear will continue to muddle along with the rest of the smartwatches.

If you're a customer of this Sprint MVNO, you've got just three days to relocate your number. Here are your options. Mobile by Rick Broida February 8, 2017 7:00 AM PST @cheapskateblog Sprint is forcing RingPlus to hang up on subscribers. RingPlus Late last Friday, mobile carrier (and Sprint MVNO) RingPlus sent a notice to subscribers indicating service would be shut off on Feb. 11 at 3 p.m. PT. If you're one of those subscribers, you're probably scrambling to figure out what to do next. RingPlus promises that all customers will have the option of migrating directly to former rival Ting during the next 1-2 weeks. "Each member will start with a $35 credit, regardless of whether they have any RingPlus Top Up balance! Those members who have a RingPlus Top Up balance higher than $35 will get the first $35 applied in full. Afterwards, the remaining Top Up balance (over $35) will be disbursed in $5 credit increments each month until the Top Up is exhausted," the company said. You can find out more at the newly created ringtoting.com. Whatever you decide, it's time to start shopping for a new carrier. If you don't make a change before service terminates on Saturday, you'll lose your phone number. Fortunately, it's a simple matter to port that number elsewhere, though the process can sometimes take a day or two -- all the more reason to make your move now. How to know where to go When you moved to RingPlus, you most likely brought an unlocked, Sprint-compatible phone. (It's also possible you brought an iPhone 6 from AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon, or a Nexus 5/6 -- all models that can operate on CDMA networks.) That means you need to take your phone to a compatible carrier. If it's a Sprint model, look for other Sprint MVNOs (or even Sprint itself). If it's one of the aforementioned iPhones or Nexuses, you have a lot more options, because they can run on GSM networks as well. For purposes of this post, I'll be looking primarily at Sprint-based alternatives, as I suspect the bulk of RingPlus users will need one. But there's a harsh reality to face, here: With one possible exception, you're not going to find totally free service. Here are some options: CellNuvo CellNuvo Take a dash of RingPlus and a pinch of Freedompop (see below) and you get CellNuvo, the only other service to offer a totally free plan -- though with a few limitations, of course. For starters, although the company's home page indicates support for both Android phones and iPhones, a company rep told me the latter aren't currently supported. Sure enough, when I checked the IMEI number for an iPhone that's currently on RingPlus, CellNuvo's system wouldn't accept it. The Sprint-powered service, which launched in 2015, offers two plans: Infinite and Flex, priced at $0 and $19 per month, respectively. Both are based on credits: Infinite gives you 2,500 each month; Flex, 5,000. A text message uses one credit. A minute of calling uses 10 credits, as does each megabyte of 4G LTE data. So, brass tacks: If you're just looking at the data side of it, the free plan gives you 250MB per month -- not much, obviously. But there are ways to earn additional credits, and customers coming from RingPlus can apply coupon code RPFree at checkout to get bonus starter credits and free activation (normally $29). Google Voice Google's free phone service, which recently received some much-needed updates, might be the perfect place to "park" your number -- though keep in mind you'll still need to find a carrier for data, messaging and traditional cell service. If you already have a Google Voice number, you can replace it with your RingPlus mobile number. If you don't, just set up a new Google Voice account (or even a brand new Google account, solely for this purpose) and port your RingPlus number as part of the process. Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Either way, it'll cost you $20. But that's a one-time cost; there are no additional charges to use GV unless you're making calls outside the US or Canada. What's nice about Google Voice is that it can automatically forward incoming calls to just about any other number. When you switch to another carrier, you don't necessarily have to port your number out of GV; you can leave it there and just have calls forwarded to whatever new number is assigned by your new carrier. Speaking of which, that new number can now serve as a second number on your mobile phone. Perk! Freedompop If you're looking for a totally free replacement for RingPlus (which, depending on the plan you had, might have been totally free for you), the only real option is Freedompop -- but for a few reasons it's not a good one. It, too, is a Sprint-based MVNO, one that's been around a lot longer than RingPlus and has obviously figured out how to make the free-service model work. However, its basic plan limits you to 500 voice minutes, 200 text messages and 500MB of data per month -- far short of most of the free plans offered by RingPlus. Also, although Freedompop charges only $9.99 to port a number, it won't accept numbers from RingPlus or Google Voice. So you'll have no choice but to start with a new one. Finally, as the Cheapskate, I get more complaints about Freedompop than just about any other company. Readers tend to be unhappy with both customer service and the service itself (specifically coverage and call quality). So although I wanted to make you aware of the option, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Republic Wireless Republic Wireless At one time the low-cost carrier, Republic Wireless was the first to really leverage the idea of money-saving Wi-Fi calling. Alas, Republic's rates no longer seem quite as amazing, and the service is currently compatible with only 16 phones (all of them Android models -- sorry, iPhone users), but it's still worth a look as you weigh your migration options. Especially considering that Republic just offered RingPlus users a $50 credit for switching, which could cover your first couple months of service, depending on the plan you choose. Just take note that you'll need to order a SIM card ($5) for your phone, assuming it's compatible. What's more, Republic still relies on Wi-Fi for calling, switching to cell towers only when a hotspot isn't available. That might prove a huge plus if you live in a coverage-challenged area (few or no bars inside your house, for example, but in my experience, Wi-Fi call quality is hit and miss. Ting Ting Another mobile disruptor, this one famed for its excellent customer service, Ting is already welcoming RingPlus refugees with open arms. There's no charge to port your number, though Ting does note that the process could take a couple days. Ting is best known for its usage-based rates, which effectively customize your service plan based on your monthly consumption of voice minutes, text messages and data. This may work in your favor, but it may not: A user who consumes 500 minutes, 1,000 texts and just 2GB of data will pay $40 per month. There are definitely cheaper options out there. TextNow TextNow TextNow is another Sprint MVNO, with plans starting at $13.99 per month. The company doesn't charge a fee to port your number, and numbers from RingPlus can be ported. A TextNow representative informed me that "TextNow will be porting numbers within 1-3 business days to ensure [RingPlus customers] don't lose their numbers." However, TextNow "strongly recommends" purchasing one of its own phones instead of bringing your own, largely because of its reliance on voice-over-IP calls. The company's own handsets have been specially configured to better take advantage of that technology. Tello Tello Based on my perusal of a Reddit thread devoted to the RingPlus/Sprint lawsuit, many customers are moving to Tello -- a Ting-like provider that lets you craft your own service plan. The company's support page has already been updated to help RingPlus users make the move. There's no fee for porting your number and no activation charge. Tello is another newcomer, though, not even a year old yet. Consequently, it's natural to feel a little gun-shy, especially given that its rates are merely competitive. For example, unlimited minutes and messages and 3GB of data will cost you $43 monthly for the first three months, then $49 after that. Contrast that with Sprint proper, which offers unlimited everything for $50 per month. Tello has also extended a special offer to RingPlus customers: 50 percent off your first order when you apply coupon code RINGPLUS50 at checkout. Other options As I noted earlier, the type of phone you have will dictate where you can take it for service. If it's tied to Sprint, check out this list of MVNOs, making sure to focus on those that support CDMA technology. Just be prepared for sticker shock, because there are few carriers that come anywhere near to matching what RingPlus offered. As an aside, if you hitched your phone wagon to RingPlus on my recommendation, I do apologize for this turn of events. It's the old adage writ large: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I'm especially saddened for those who paid a hefty "Member+" membership fee, though I suspect that if you amortize it out over the months you got free service, you still ended up with a good deal. Small comfort, I know. If you've found or know of a good substitute for RingPlus, please do share it in the comments. Update, February 8: Added statements from RingPlus and various other companies.

By David Gilbert February 9, 2017 15:15 GMT Tech vs Trump: (From top left clockwise) CEO of SpaceX Elon Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, CEO of Apple Inc. Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai CEO of GoogleGetty Images Almost 100 of the biggest names in technology signed a letter condemning Donald Trump's immigration policies. Apple, Google, Uber, AirBnb, Snap, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and many other household names were happy to publicly criticise the new US president, despite the possibility that it could harm their business. Even Tesla, initially a hold out due to Elon Musk's presence on Trump's Economic Advisory Council, relented and signed the "friend of the court" amicus brief. It was the clearest sign yet that the tech industry was worried what a ban on immigrants and potential limitation on visas could do for their business. The brief outlined four ways that Trump's policy is "inflicting substantial harm on US companies." For companies operating in the US, this all seems very logical. By limiting their ability to hire the best people, they will not be able to create the best products and will there lose competitive advantage over their rivals elsewhere in the world. "The greatest threat to the United States is that really bright people will turn their backs on the country as a place of opportunity," said Jay Rosenzweig, the CEO of global executive search firm Rosenzweig & Company, which has worked with the likes of IBM, Cisco, Accenture and Hyperloop Transport Technologies. Hindering the ability of American companies to attract great talent Increasing costs imposed on business Making it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace Giving global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations — and hire new employees — outside the US Adding to the worry is the fact the White House is said to be mulling over another executive order to limit the number of H-1B visas – used to allow US companies to hire overseas workers to fill technical roles. Additionally Trump is also said to be ready to scrap the International Entrepreneur Rule, a program designed to entice startup company founders to relocate to the US and grow their companies there, rather than elsewhere. How the UK could benefit from Trump's immigration policy But one man's loss is another man's opportunity – and in this case, the UK could be ready to finally stake its position as an alternative hub of creativity and innovation in the technology field. The new Valley? London's Silicon Roundabout is the home of many tech companiesGetty Images London – along with a string of other international cities such as Berlin, Singapore and Paris – has long strived to become "the new Silicon Valley". It has Silicon Roundabout, but so far the biggest tech companies based in the capital are all US companies. This has been highlighted recently with Google's massive investment in a new King's Cross headquarters; Facebook's expansion of its presence; and most recently Snap's decision to locate its international headquarters in the British capital. If Trump's bans remain in place and he dissuades people from working in the US, companies like Google, Facebook and Snap will have to look to other locations to hire the people they need, so that will likely mean new jobs in London. But for London, and the UK in general, to really take this opportunity, it will need to make itself attractive to the entrepreneurs who have always looked to Silicon Valley as the place where they will build their companies. We have seen in recent years that there is a mindset among many founders of UK tech startups to exit early for what may seem like a sizeable chunk of change – typically to some large US company. The result is that the UK has not seen the emergence of a homegrown tech company anywhere near the size of a Google or Facebook. The next Silicon Valley For London – or Cambridge or Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham or Liverpool – to become the next Silicon Valley, that mindset has to change, and in order to attract the types of entrepreneurs who may build companies of this size, the government needs to make sure it has policies in place that will give startups the guidance and support they need. The UK is just one of many locations around the world which will be vying to attract the best and brightest in the tech sector. In Europe, Ireland will be flaunting its low corporate tax rate, unfettered access to the 500 million consumers in the EU, and an educated work force. Closer to Silicon Valley, Canada is also likely to be an attractive option for companies looking to relocate. It has a large, educated workforce; is located right next to the US market, and has shown itself to be incredibly welcoming of immigrants. The UK, and London in particular, can compete on the international stage, however for anyone considering relocating to the UK, there is one big red flashing warning light – Brexit. As the government pushes ahead with triggering Article 50, they will need to convince anyone seeking to set up shop here that they will be welcomed and that they won't face the same challenges of hiring staff as companies in the US are facing. They will also need to convince them that access to the European single market won't be a problem. For now, that seems like it is going to be a tough sell. More from IBTimes UK Technology Oh, Snap!

The company informs them it is considering limiting or removing these apps from Google Play if they do not meet the User Data policy. Google has asked developers to fix the issue with their apps by March 15 or has warned that administrative action will be taken to limit the visibility of the app. The Next Web reports that a significant number of developers are receiving a warning about how their app lacks a valid privacy policy. Google's latest move could be a big blow for half-baked apps that have made their way to the Google Play and handle personal or sensitive data . According to Google's User Data policy, developers have to be transparent how they handle user data (information provided by a user, collected about a user, and collected about a user's use of the app or device). It further adds that the app is required to comply with additional restrictions or procedures if required by an applicable law. Google describes the "Privacy Policy and Secure Transmission" in User Data policy, "If your app handles personal or sensitive user data (including personally identifiable information, financial and payment information, authentication information, phonebook or contact data, microphone and camera sensor data, and sensitive device data) then your app must: 1) Post a privacy policy in both the designated field in the Play Developer Console and from within the Play distributed app itself. 2) Handle the user data securely, including transmitting it using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS)." As per the notice shared by The Next Web, Google is warning developers who do not adhere to the company's policy that their app's visibilty could be limited, or it could even be removed from Google Play. Developers will either need to link to a valid privacy policy, or stop requesting sensitive permissions or user data. Developers have until March 15 to make the changes. The move to remove apps that do not follow the guidelines set by Google will surely boost confidence in Android users which at times struggle to find the right app due to presence of fake ones.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Christopher Ingraham By Christopher Ingraham February 9 Follow @_cingraham Donald Trump takes the stage to formally accept the nomination on the last day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. (Mike Segar/Reuters) On the heels of Donald Trump's election, fascism seems to be having a moment — at least according to a few measures. George Orwell's dystopian fiction "1984" has risen to the top of Amazon's bestsellers list, with plans to make it into a Broadway musical. Margaret Atwood's “The Handmaid's Tale” — about life under a totalitarian regime — is coming to Hulu. “Fascism” is in the top 1 percent of words people are looking up on Merriam-Webster online. A Holocaust Museum poster listing what it calls the telltale signs of fascism has gone viral on Twitter. In the US Holocaust Museum. I'm shook. pic.twitter.com/EeuHEXWusE — Sarah Rose (@RaRaVibes) January 30, 2017 The trend is clearly evident on Google, where searches for “fascism” this month have spiked to unprecedented levels, at least since Google began tracking search trends in 2004. The chart above represents the share of queries for “fascism” against all searches in a given time period. So far in February 2017, fascism's share of all searches is more than five times that of its share of searches before 2016. We can get some sense of the total volume, however, by comparing this with a search for something that we'd reasonably expect to pull in big numbers. Like say, American heartthrob and “La La Land” star Ryan Gosling? Or what about hit reality TV series “The Bachelor”? So, there are your benchmarks: Fascism is currently bigger than Ryan Gosling, who recently received an Oscar nomination for best actor, but smaller than “The Bachelor.” But what do these searches actually mean? Google can't peer into the souls of its users, but we can learn a bit about what they're up to by examining what they're searching for in addition to fascism — in Google parlance, their “related searches.” In the past 90 days, the top related searches include phrases like “what is fascism” and “fascist definition,” suggesting that people are simply trying to figure out what fascism actually is. For the record, Merriam-Webster defines it as a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition. Is this because of Trump? It seems likely that some of it is attributable to debate over the new president. Some critics, both on the right and left, have been accusing Trump of harboring totalitarian or fascist tendencies. These anti-Trump voices include Russian dissident Garry Kasparov, Michael Kinsley of Vanity Fair, Peter Bergen of CNN and historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat of New York University — who, by way of example, point to things like Trump's attacks on judges and the media, his expression of admiration for strongman leaders, and his embrace of ethnic nationalism. So if people are throwing the word “fascism” around, other folks are going to look it up online to see what it means. Trump supporters say he's simply exhibiting the “strong leadership” that he promised during the campaign, or that his more outlandish statements shouldn't be taken literally, or that, in the end, facts don't actually matter. More to the point, we can correlate the amount of search interest in Donald Trump with the amount of search interest in fascism. Here's what that looks like. Between Nov. 1 of last year and Jan. 31 of this year, generally speaking days that saw more search interest in Donald Trump also saw more interest in fascism. You can see that in the chart above. Or it could be the opposite — searches for fascism predict searches for Trump. If critics or members of the media start throwing the word “fascist” around, people are going to start looking the term up. These numbers don't say anything about causality. But they do provide a solid indication that the current interest in fascism is related to the rise of Trump.  Of course, in today's hyperpartisan political environment, looking for the worst in your opponent has become routine. For instance, in the wake of Barack Obama's election in 2008 searches for “socialism” spiked in a way similar to what we're seeing for fascism searches today. Here are fascism and socialism plotted together for comparison (that second big spike in socialism in February 2016 appears to correspond with a survey release showing millennials having a higher opinion of socialism than of capitalism).   business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

Now, smartphone owners are wondering when they’ll get Nougat. HTC has been one of the best in terms of keeping users informed. With that in mind, here’s what we know about upcoming HTC Android Nougat updates. Including carrier versions of the HTC 10, the unlocked A9 and more. Advertisement For several months now many Nexus owners have been testing and enjoying Android Nougat. It’s loaded with a lot of new features, improved battery life, multi-window mode and more. All things HTC owners should want. Technically we’re now on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which has further features and big fixes. Additionally, Android 7.1.2 is in a limited beta. Read: Android 6.0 vs Android 7.0 Nougat: What’s New So Far The Android N beta ended in August and quickly arrived for many. We’ve since seen betas, developer previews, and two updates. HTC promised updates within 90 days, which was before the end of 2016. They hit their mark for unlocked devices, and are now moving on to carrier models in the US as 2017 moves forward. Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see an update to Android 7.0 Nougat in the near future. Or Android 7.1 Nougat. HTC was first to make announcements, but LG and Motorola sent updates out first. Advertisement In a surprise move during the summer of 2016 after some Google announcements, HTC confirmed three key HTC Android N software updates are in the pipeline. While only three phones were mentioned, we can expect more to probably get the same new software. Now that Android 7.0 Nougat is official and has been released, they’ve been sharing more details. HTC Android 7.0 Nougat Updates We’ve known for a while that HTC is working hard on updates. However, the release date has been a mystery. And while we’re still expecting the HTC One M9 and HTC 10 to get it, unlocked models were up first. On December 5th, the day Android 7.1.1 was released, HTC confirmed the One M9 update. Starting with the unlocked edition. Then, carrier models will get the same sometime in 2017. And now, they are starting to roll out. Android Nougat will begin rolling out to the unlocked #HTCOneM9 starting late this evening. Carrier variants to follow early next year. pic.twitter.com/O5YP1l2Mdp — HTC USA (@HTCUSA) December 5, 2016 Above is a tweet from HTC USA on December 5th. Confirming Nougat started, and will continue into 2017. That is the only device being mentioned at this time. Advertisement Update: Those with an HTC 10 on T-Mobile should be happy that Android 7.0 Nougat rolled out on January 5th. Other carriers should follow soon, then other phones. The first HTC Android 7.0 Nougat update was the unlocked HTC 10 on November 25th. Then the HTC One M9 unlocked developer edition. Now we’re starting to see movement on HTC 10 from carriers. What about the HTC A9? Well, unlocked models should receive it starting January 16th. HTC One A9 Unlocked Owners! We have received technical approval on the Nougat OS update, and OTA will begin tonight! — Mo Versi (@moversi) January 16, 2017 Advertisement Now that those updates have finished the company is moving on to others in the US and around the globe. In fact, this week the HTC 10 Nougat update is arriving in the UK, according to HTC.  Although it recently was delayed. The HTC One M9 Android 7.0 Nougat update is also hitting select devices. Although no carrier-specific announcements have been made. Android Nougat for #HTCOneM9 is now also live @htc @HTCelevate @LlabTooFeR pic.twitter.com/idfWvfGSw4 — Robert John Virrey (@rjvirrey) January 24, 2017 Advertisement Update: As of February 2nd we have more good news for HTC owners waiting on Nougat. The companies own Gram Wheeler announced a slew of updates on Twitter, future plans, and even some delays in Europe. Excited to share that Nougat will rolled out today for HTC One M9 devices in Mainland Europe, Turkey and South Africa. — Graham Wheeler (@wheelergd) February 2, 2017 Europe, Turkey and South Africa are now getting Nougat on the HTC One M9, and more countries will get it in the coming days. Likely early next week. More countries to follow over the coming days. — Graham Wheeler (@wheelergd) February 2, 2017 Now, all we need is the remainder of HTC 10 and HTC One M9 devices in the US to get updates. Eventually the HTC One M8 will be included, too. In closing, while HTC did hit their 90 day window and pushed updates before 2016 came to a close. They barely hit that goal. Most users with carrier models are still waiting, and we’re already into the month of February. HTC was able to release Android 6.0 Marshmallow within three months last year, but only for select regions outside the United States and unlocked models. Most US carriers ended up waiting around five months, with February and March being the actual arrival. It appears that HTC is a little ahead of that schedule for Android Nougat, but not by much. We’ll keep an eye out for further information. What’s New in Android Nougat Our link at the top of the page is an in-depth look at Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7.0 Nougat, and everything that’s new and different with comparison photos. It goes over many of the key changes, so start there. As a quick recap, the HTC Android 7.0 update bring improved performance, better battery life with “Doze” features, split-screen multitasking, the recent apps button works like ALT+TAB and switches between the last used apps, and much more. Google has over 50 big changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, revamped notifications with quick reply from the pulldown bar, customizable quick setting tiles and so much more. All of that and more will complete HTC’s software upgrades. A huge addition announced back at Google IO was “Android Instant Apps” which will enable Android to install small bits of an app (say, from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. No installing an app and starting over. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, uses the app then removes those parts, and we’re done. Not to mention things like a better and improved Google Now or Search using the Google Assistant with machine learning, number blocking and call screening. That’s just a short list of many changes. Many are behind the scenes. Of course most of this will come with HTC Sense UI over the top, with additions like HTC Blinkfeed and other small tweaks that each manufacturer adds. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC uses Sense UI, and LG has their own interface over stock Android as well. Not every new feature will be implemented, others will be changed, but this is a big and exciting update to Android for all devices. HTC Android 7.1.1 Nougat Release Date As of right now it’s far too early to remotely speculate on release dates for other carriers and HTC devices. More so, we don’t know when they’ll update to Android 7.1.1 Nougat. That’s the latest release right from Google. Right now Android 7.0 is what’s being delivered. In fact, we could see most manufacturers, including HTC, skip right to Android 7.1.2 Nougat in the next 2-4 months. From what we’re seeing so far HTC has updated developer editions, unlocked models and is now moving to carrier phones. That means everyone with a new HTC phone should expect updates in the foreseeable future. 15 Responses 05/21/2016 Mariaelawrence Reply wonderful…!Ｉ ᴊᴜｓᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴘᴀɪᴅ 6784ＵＳＤ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏғғ ᴍʏ ʟᴀᴘᴛᴏᴘ ᴛʜɪｓ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ.

Only if you have bought a phone in the last year are you likely to have Marshmallow. I asked 8 friends what version they have on their Galaxy models, and only 2 have 6.0. Unless you throw your phone away once a year, you are abandoned as far as Android updates by manufacturers go. 06/30/2016 David Ness Reply I totally get what you’re saying. I wasn’t getting an update for my phone directly so I downloaded the Samsung Smart Switch app on my PC and installed 6.01 onto my Galaxy S6 and it was just released this month… in other words I bypassed my carrier. 08/01/2016 Ankur Reply htc are like a cheater and does not provide any android update for 816g . So i strictly recommend all not to buy phone like htc i.e. also costly and service of HTC is also very poor. 08/27/2016 Lonnie Santrock Reply I’ve had the HTC 7 8 9 and now the 10 I will never buy another HTC phone their customer service sucks. Americans and Canadians are treated differently some reason and in Canada we are not having access to the upper screen replacement I cry foul never again HTC. 08/22/2016 Claude Reply So, it seems like everyone at HTC will enjoy the benefits of the new OS and will remove their B & H app from their phones as early as late 2016.

Google posted a reminder on Google+ saying converted clicks is being retired next month, in March 2017. Google wrote, "Converted clicks are being retired in March 2017, after 15 years." "The Conversions column is the best way to measure valuable actions for your business," Google added. Many folks set up stuff in Google AdWords and rarely look, so this is why Google has to continually send out reminders. Google said: “Conversions” give you everything “Converted clicks” did, and much more. For example, “Conversions” can take advantage of non-last-click attribution models and different counting options in addition to measuring important actions like cross-device conversions and store visits. Most advertisers already use “Conversions” as their primary reporting metric and are not impacted by this transition. If you are still using “Converted clicks” with automated rules or custom columns, visit our Help Center to learn more and update to “Conversions” Forum discussion at Google+.

Google added a new "Data Studio connector for Search Console," Google said. "With this launch users can pull their data into Data Studio to build reports that include impressions, clicks, and average position broken out by keyword, date, country, and device," Google added. Search Console users can now build Data Studio reports to understand how their search traffic changes over time, where traffic is coming from, and what search queries are most likely to drive traffic to their sites. Users can also filter reports for mobile traffic to improve mobile targeting, and to analyze clickthrough rates for various organic search terms. As always, Data Studio report creators can add components from other data sources into a single report. With this new connector, users can use the Search Console and AdWords connectors to compare performance across paid and organic search, or add Google Analytics data to analyze site-side performance. Note that Search Console metrics can be aggregated by either site or by page (URL). This is configured in the Data Source creation flow, where users can select either “Site Impression” or “URL Impression”. To learn more about the distinction between these two methods please see the Search Analytics Report Help Center article. Want to know how to set this up?

Well, if you search for [top websites] in Google you get that carousel and it shows "popular websites." It is unclear if they are listed in a specific order but Gary Illyes from Google implied the list comes from alexa.com/topsites but the order there is different from what Google shows.

But the company predominantly known for producing the graphics chips inside laptops has revised and relaunched its TV streamer/game console hybrid. And I like what I'm seeing. Running on Google's open source Android TV operating system, the Shield TV has access to basically every content provider you can think of: Netflix, Amazon, iPlayer and YouTube are all present and correct. Then there's also the option to load on the likes of Kodi and Plex to get your hands on even more content. Read More HTC Vive VR headset review: The virtual future is here.. and it’s mindblowing The Nvidia Shield TV fits in the palm of your hand (Photo: Jeff Parsons) That's one half of the equation, the other half is a capable games console powered by Nvidia graphics with a line-up of titles like Batman's Arkham series, Borderlands and Just Cause 2. The Nvidia Shield comes packaged with a game controller that somewhat resembles an Xbox One controller, and also has access to an exclusive library of games - as well as all the ones already available on Google Play. So it’s near enough everything you could need under your TV. What are the drawbacks? Well, for one it comes in at £189.99, which is tough to stomach when you consider that Google’s Chromecast Ultra costs £69. Read More Resident Evil 7 review: A masterful puzzle box of horrors (Photo: Nvidia) Secondly, the Shield doesn't do much that you can't get from an Xbox or PS4 for a little bit more of an outlay. And those two consoles have a range of exclusive AAA games that vastly outstrip what’s offered by the Shield. That said, if you’re a content consumer that wants options, the Nvidia Shield has plenty of them. Here’s how the little gadget breaks down. Design Forget the comfortable hockey puck of a Chromecast or the slim USB-style Fire TV Stick , the Shield is all about the angles. It looks a bit like something Picasso might turn out after leaving product design school. Nvdia has kept the design the same as last year's Shield TV but, crucially, shrunk the whole thing by 40%. It measures about 8 inches across and will fit in the palm of your hand. Read More Tech predictions for 2017: From artificially intelligent chatbots to the 10th anniversary of the iPhone There's a wealth of content available on the Shield TV (Photo: Jeff Parsons) Both the game controller and remote control are well thought out, and the latter allows you to use voice commands to search for content. The controller itself is comfortable and will be instantly familiar to any Xbox or PlayStation users. The one criticism of the gaming accessory is that it lacks the heft of either Sony or Microsoft's offerings. That being said, Nvdia is now packaging the controller as standard with every Shield TV, which is helpful. Content Content is where the Shield really shines though, and there's a lot of it. The user interface is set out with the biggest names the most visible - Netflix, iPlayer, YouTube and, amazingly, Amazon Prime Video. Read More Nintendo Switch event: 10 questions that will determine whether the new console succeeds or fails Nvidia Shield TV is great for gaming - the pad lasts 60 hours on a single charge (Photo: Nvidia) But for the tinkering geek, there's a world of content to unlock thanks to the likes of Plex and Kodi, which allow you to host streams from your own collection or the web in general on the Shield. If you're not too fussed about plumbing the depths of the internet for stuff to watch or play then you'll be content to give the Shield a miss. But if you want the most choice for your money, ignore it at your peril. Features As I've said, a big part of the Shield TV is gaming, and it comes with a Nvidia's GeForce Now service built in. This cloud-based store works a bit like Steam - you can either buy games outright or subscribe monthly to access older titles like Tomb Raider. If you've got a Nvidia-equipped PC in the house, you can stream any games you've got to the Shield TV and play it directly on your big HDR TV. Likewise, the Shield TV has full Chromecast options (it's running on Android, after all) so you can sling anything from your phone or tablet directly to the little green box. Read More Prototype of cutting-edge three-screen Razer laptop computer stolen in 'industrial espionage' at CES The Nvidia Shield TV controller (Photo: Nvidia) Because the Shield TV is built on Google's latest Android software it'll also fully support the Google Assistant when it's delivered via an update later this year. Even if you own the older 2015 model, you'll still get the update. Voice search works on both the remote and the controller. Conclusion If you're only a moderate consumer of TV shows and already have a smart TV or some kind of streaming device and a games console like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One then there's no need to spend your hard-earned cash on the Shield TV. And yet, this is certainly the most exciting media streamer I've reviewed. There are a lot of different options available for those willing to spend a bit of time poking around inside its menus and apps. If you're a PC gamer then the Shield TV becomes a lot more attractive thanks to its game streaming abilities. But essentially it's more of a jack-of-all-trades. Games consoles offer a better gaming experience and basic streaming can be had for a lot cheaper. Indeed, most tellys these days will come with the basics built-in. But for gadget nerds looking for the perfect companion to your shiny new HDR TV then the Shield TV should be right near the top of your wishlist.

My guess is that it wasn’t that long ago – 79% of shoppers will conduct research online while browsing in-store. More and more of your shoppers are being influenced by their mobile devices as they shop. The folks at Google have released some interesting data about how mobile impacts shoppers in the automotive industry, and I think you can take away some lessons about online advertising. I’ve pulled the top takeaways from Google’s research. Let’s take a look at how they apply to your dealership. Adjust your mobile advertising for your peak season. Google found summer and the holiday season are peak months for automotive dealers. We know that as a powersports dealer, summer is a busy time for you, too. To get the most bang for your online advertising buck, consider optimizing your budget for your peak season. You know shoppers are searching for new motorcycles and ATVs during the summer months, so increase your PPC spend during this timeframe to ensure they’re finding your dealership and not heading to your nearest competitor. You can also create ads that are tailored for the products people are searching for at this time of year. If Yamaha motorcycles are a big seller for you in the summer, create ads specific to the models you carry or seasonal promotions to get shoppers interested in buying. Use day-parting to get the most from your ads. Most shoppers in Google’s study were searching for a new car over their lunch break instead of after work. If you knew that most of your potential customers spent their lunch hour looking for a new UTV, you’d want to make sure they could easily find your dealership, right? Day-parting allows you to display your online ads only during the times of day shoppers are most likely to be searching. This can help you two ways – first, shoppers are only seeing your ads when you want them to. If you only want to show your ads during business hours so someone is at your dealership to answer any questions if the shopper calls or stops in, you can control that. The second way it can help you is by optimizing your budget. If your website isn’t eCommerce-friendly and a potential customer has no way of making a purchase from you outside of business hours, you can ensure that they’re not clicking your ad (which costs you money!) when they can’t follow through and make a purchase. Make your website a resource for shoppers. When a shopper is out on your lot or in your dealership, chances are they’re using their smartphone as a tool to help them research your products and prices. In fact, Google found that the top action people performed with their smartphone while on the lot was making sure they’re getting a fair price. Help them find all of the information they need by packing your website full of product details, promotions and service options. You can also promote your promotions or lower-than-the-competition pricing in PPC ads to catch their eye if they ask Google a question while at your store. Your shoppers’ behavior is being influenced more than ever by mobile. Are you doing what it takes to ensure you’re providing the information they need when they do a mobile search from your dealership? Colleen Malloy is ARI’s director of marketing.

What’s been going on with Google’s mobile indexing? Industry Mobile SEO 09 Feb 17 | Rebecca Sentance Facebook0 Linkedin69 Google+16 Twitter 85 Back in October, Google announced the impending rollout of a mobile-first search index, a sure to be massive overhaul of the way Google indexes its search results which has had SEOs scrambling to prepare their businesses. In fairly typical Google fashion, a few months on from the announcement, we’re still no closer to a definitive date on when the change will take place. But some strange behaviour in mobile search results, combined with turbulent search ‘weather’ over the past few days, indicates that we could be approaching a launch. What happened? The first sign that something a little strange was happening came on Monday 6th February, when Glynn Davies, Head of Search Strategy at Pi Datametrics, noticed separate mobile sites dropping out of mobile search on Google, to be replaced with their desktop versions. Noticing separate mobile sites dropping out of Google Mobile in favour of desktop versions across several major sites… #seo #mobile pic.twitter.com/LYoEVNUgOn — Glynn Davies (@glynndaviesesq) February 6, 2017 As alarming as it might seem, this situation isn’t without precedent on Google. Google confirmed back in 2015 that it uses the desktop version of a site for ranking on mobile, while still comparing the two to check for any major discrepancies (such as users creating a spammy desktop website purely for the purposes of ranking high). And last November it was revealed that desktop pages might be ranked over AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) in certain circumstances in the upcoming mobile-first index. Still, this sudden switch seemed unprecedented, and Mozcast’s weather report – which reflects the current turbulence of Google’s algorithms by how hot and stormy the weather is – was showing some distinctly tempestuous weather on Sunday 5th and Monday 6th November. Image: Mozcast There was some speculation on Twitter as to whether this could be due to Google’s recently-implemented penalty against intrusive mobile interstitials, but there appeared to be no link between the presence of interstitials and the sites which were being affected. @BritneyMuller None of affected sites we’ve seen have interstitials. We’ll blog more today at https://t.co/UEqRuAMBRu @PiDatametrics — Glynn Davies (@glynndaviesesq) February 7, 2017 Of course, in these situations one of the best ways to gain clarity is to ping Google on Twitter. As it happened, Twitter user Vishal Marathe had already contacted John Mueller, Google’s webmaster trends analyst, a few days earlier about the same issue. Mueller’s theory was that the swap in rankings might be due to a problem in the way the sites themselves were set up. @VishMarathe411 Happy to look at examples. My guess is the sites might not be set up correctly. — John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) February 3, 2017 Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin69 Google+16 Twitter 85 Related articles Five most interesting search news stories of the week What were Google’s biggest search algorithm updates of 2016? Seven tools to help you run multichannel digital marketing campaigns Six steps to a stronger online brand Glitchy Google Pi Datametrics tracked the ranking of the affected sites on both mobile and desktop with its data-driven SEO platform, in order to try and determine what might be causing the change. Glynn Davies explained Pi’s thinking in trying to determine the cause: “Our first suspicion on noticing this was an error in configuration that was being “punished” by Google’s switch to mobile-first indexing. Google recommend a bi-directional rel=“canonical”/rel=“alternate”, which identifies the relationship between equivalent but separate mobile and desktop pages. However, that doesn’t appear to be the cause. Some affected sites are correctly configured, others appear not to be. Plus, all examples we’ve seen conditionally redirect, i.e. clicking the desktop site result on a mobile device will pass the user back to the mobile site.” An image from Pi Datametrics’ platform highlighting the sites that were affected by the mysterious change – and those which weren’t. | Image: Pi Datametrics Fashion retailer ASOS is one of the brands whose sites were affected by the switch in rankings. Image: Pi Datametrics Major fashion retailer ASOS was one of those affected, and its mobile and desktop sites exhibited some particularly strange behaviour with regard to US and UK search. Davies explained: “One of the examples, a large fashion retailer (ASOS), is further complicated by the fact that the US mobile page ranking 1st in UK mobile search has been replaced by the UK desktop equivalent (which now still redirects to the US version when accessed through SERPs). In short, there doesn’t appear to be either a clear cause or a reason why some are affected while others aren’t.” Things became significantly clearer when, on Wednesday 8th February, John Mueller tweeted to confirm that this was in fact a glitch (or “quirk”) on Google’s end, rather than intentional behaviour, and that Google was actively looking into the issue. @razbithume yeah, looks weird :). We noticed too and are looking into it on our side. Seems like a quirk on our side. — John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) February 8, 2017 As of right now, the glitch seems to still be ongoing while Google looks into things. There is a chance that the issue could be unrelated to mobile-first indexing – after all, Google has any number of algorithm updates, both big and small, in the pipeline for throughout the year – most of which we won’t even know about until they’re on top of us. Mobile-first indexing just happens to be a major one that we know is coming. But given the fact that this glitch affects mobile sites specifically, and the timing of it, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to conclude that it could be the result of tests that Google is carrying out ahead of a full implementation of the new index.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Verizon lists Wear24 LTE, LG Watch Sport with Android Wear 2.0 By Rei Padla - February 9, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Now that Google has officially launched Android Wear 2.0 and LG introduced the Watch Sport and Watch Style, you’re probably wondering what other smartwatches will be able to run the same features and services. We know those with 4G LTE connectivity can have access to a network so they can receive-send messages, as well as, be able to make-receive calls. We listed earlier what wearables will receive Android Wear 2.0 soon. There are over a dozen but we can expect more will enter the market. We already know the LG Watch Sport will be ready from Verizon, Best Buy, and AT&T. We just heard about the Wear24 smartwatch and we’re more curious to know about this one because it is exclusive and available only from Verizon. We’re familiar with the LG Watch Sport. Smartwatch allows you to contact and text friends, tap-to-pay with Android Pay, get healthy with Google Fit 2.0, and stream songs via Google Play Music. It comes with a rotating crown that lets you navigate the menus just by turning it. The Wear24 also offers the same features and functions. We don’t have much information on the specs but it runs Android Wear 2.0, therefore, it’s also capable of watch face customization, Android Pay, water-resistance, and of course, 4G LTE connectivity. At this point, Verizon is the first to bring reliable connection. The smartwatches make use of your smartphone number so calls and SMS are always sent to both devices. No need to carry your phone with you especially of you’re going out for a quick run. It’s also okay now to “forget” your phone because of the said feature. You can pre-order for the LG Watch Sport beginning tomorrow, February 10, only at Verizon. It costs $329.99 with activation for 2-years. The Wear24 smartwatch also requires a 2-year activation aside from the $299.99 upfront price.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: News Ibori, Seun Egbegbe top Google search Published February 9, 2017February 9, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 The return of the convicted former Governor of Delta, James Ibori, was one of the top stories that dominated Google. The Google Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, Mr. Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, in a statement in Lagos on Thursday said that the week starting from February 1 to February 8 could be described as quite sensational, “if one was to use the Google Trends as a measure. He said, “The return of James Ibori, convicted former Governor of Delta, made the news again, when he returned to Nigeria. “The former statesman has been in the news since he was charged to court for several corruption charges before he was extradited to the UK for trial and conviction. “He was recently released from a London prison after completing a 13-year jail term.’’ Another top sensational trend in Nigeria was the news of a popular star accused of fraud. Kola-Ogunlade said that the popular Nollywood filmmaker, Seun Karim, a.k.a Seun Egbegbe, was in the news again for allegedly trying to defraud an unsuspecting bureau de change operator of N10m. According to him, Seun pretended to be a medical doctor while trying to defraud the bureau de change operator. He said, “This accusation comes six days before his appearance in court for alleged theft of nine iPhones in November 2016.’’ Kola-Ogunlade said that the #IStandWithNigeria protest, which was held without the popular musician, Tuface, its mastermind, was a top trend. He said, “Just as the internet was ready to stand with Tuface who announced on social media that he would lead a protest against the Nigerian Government, he backed out. “The well-respected musician explained that he stalled the event due to security concerns and public safety considerations. “The protest which was publicized as #IStandWithNigeria, went on as planned without him in Lagos, Abuja and some other parts of Nigeria,” he said.

By Luke Johnson / Published 9th February 2017 GETTY OFFLINE VIEWING: Google is making it easier to watch YouTube videos without the internet YouTube and its endless supply of addictive viewing can be a great time killer. Unfortunately the times you most want it - such as while enduing a boring commute - you often struggle for internet access. Don't worry though, as there's now an easier way to download YouTube videos and enjoy them on the move thanks to Google's new YouTube Go app. Designed for those living in areas with poor Wi-Fi connectivity and limited data coverage, the Android app will let users enjoy videos without being hit by lofty bills or struggling with endless buffering. GETTY Originally announced in late 2016 alongside an "early next year" release date at the Google for India event in New Delhi, the app has now hit its first market. In a bid to save data and speed up the viewing process, the app offers users the option of watching videos immediately or viewing them offline at a later date. Although making it easier to download videos for anytime viewing, there is a catch - image quality. Happy Birthday YouTube! Thursday, 23rd April 2015 Today marks 10 years since the birth of YouTube. To celebrate, check out our gallery of the 10 biggest video hits - and misses - of all time. 1 / 11 YouTube Popular YouTube vlogger Hannah Minx was ranked one of the sexiest vloggers of all time Fans of gorgeous 1080p Full HD footage - or even 720p HD videos - are set to be disappointed, with only low quality videos able to be downloaded. To help decide which resolution is best for download, the app will tell you how much storage space is currently available on your phone, and how much each video will eat into this at different resolutions. Letting you share the offline love, YouTube Go also lets users transfer download videos between devices over Bluetooth. Like Facebook Lite and other similar apps, YouTube Go has been designed with developing markets, where internet is often slow and unreliable. As such, it's currently only available in the Indian Google Play Store, although a wider rollout is expected in the near future. For those who simply can't wait, the installer can already be found at APK Mirror for those who want to add the app manually.

The four smartphones won’t be available for purchase and to receive software support from Telus anymore. The highly popular 2015 smartphones that were removed by Telus are Huawei Nexus 6P, BlackBerry Priv, BlackBerry Leap and Motorola Nexus 6. The only device that doesn’t run on Google’s Android operating system from that list is BlackBerry Leap. In fact, this device is the second oldest from the above mentioned smartphones. The oldest device though, is Motorola Nexus 6 which was launched back in 2014. The other two have been both launched in 2015. Worth mentioning is that customers can still acquire these devices from Telus because they are still in stock, but once the stock runs out Telus will not bring them back. Regarding software support, Huawei Nexus 6P is the only that’s still going to receive anymore updates. It is highly unlikely that BlackBerry Priv and BlackBerry Leap will get any new software updates because they are quite old. Additionally, Google recently confirmed that it has stopped supporting Motorola Nexus 6. This shouldn’t come as any surprise to anyone since the device is also very old, being launched in 2014. Worth mentioning is that users who are still holding on to their older devices won’t be able to repair them at Telus, that’s if they bought it from Telus in the first place. On the bright side, online retailers such as Amazon offer a wide array of replaceable hardware parts for those devices. Even though users might not be able to find a specific hardware part, they should know that they can acquire any of those above mentioned devices for low prices such as $200 for a BlackBerry Leap. Nonetheless, customers that are looking to upgrade their older smartphone should be happy to know that Telus has a bunch of devices available. For example Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P users can upgrade their device to Google’s latest Pixel. This smartphone can be found on Telus. Also, BlackBerry Mercury who is slated to be launched during MWC will also be made available for purchase on Telus.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Complete list of smartwatches that will get Android Wear 2.0: Asus ZenWatch, Moto 360, Fossil Q and others Android Wear 2.0 will come with many exciting features that will give a new experience to the users. Raymond Ronamai   February 9, 2017 18:46 IST SmartwatchesGoogle Blog Android Wear 2.0 is all set to make its debut with LG Watch Sport and Watch Style, which were designed in collaboration with Google, on Friday (February 10) after months of anticipation. The new version of the operating system will not only be seen in the upcoming Android Wear smartwatches but also in over a dozen old devices. The new operating system, Android Wear 2.0, will come with many exciting features that will give a new experience to the users. By personalising "watch face" feature, you can check information from your favourite apps by looking at your watch instead of reaching for your mobile phone. This means you can book an Uber ride, start a workout, and several other activities by swiping "watch face." [READ: When will Android Wear 2.0 finally arrive?] The new OS gives you a complete control of the apps installed in the smartwatch and has more ways to respond to messages – by dictating, writing or handwriting your response. It also comes with Google Assistant and Google Fit to help the users track the pace, distance, calories burned and heart rate during physical activities.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Saturday, February 11, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 11748 73 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

By Liam Tung | February 9, 2017 -- 11:56 GMT (03:56 PST) | Topic: Security Google Project Zero's Gal Beniamini details four key errors he used to bypass Knox's kernel protections on a Galaxy S7 edge. Image: ZDNet Google's Project Zero hackers have detailed several high-severity flaws that undermined a core defense in Samsung's Knox platform that protects Galaxy handsets in the enterprise. Since launching Knox in 2013, the platform has been certified for internal use by UK and US government departments, including the US DoD and NSA. Given these certifications, defense-in-depth mechanisms should be rock solid. Israeli researchers poke holes in Samsung KNOX security system The serious vulnerabilities impact Samsung's Knox security sandbox. Read More But according to Project Zero's Gal Beniamini, who last year tore apart Android's full disk encryption, a Knox hypervisor designed to protect the Linux kernel during runtime can be subverted multiple ways. Beniamini details four key errors he used to bypass Knox's kernel protections on a Galaxy S7 edge with Samsung's Exynos chipset. They're rather serious given that compromising the kernel would allow an attacker to access system data, hide malware, change system behavior, or take over the system. While Android's Trusted Boot protects the integrity of the kernel during boot, it doesn't protect the kernel after it's booted and running. This shortcoming was why Samsung introduced its Knox hypervisor, known as Real-time Kernel Protection or RKP, which uses the ARM TrustZone to create a "secure world" walled from the "normal world". Samsung fixed the six RKP issues reported by Beniamini in its January Android patch and lists them as memory corruption, information disclosure, privilege escalation, and authentication bypass bugs. As Beniamini explains, since Knox v2.6, Samsung devices implemented an exploit-mitigation feature called Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), which should prevent an attacker predicting the address the kernel is loaded to. However, a simple coding error by Samsung made it possible to calculate the location. "This security feature introduces a random 'offset', generated each time the device boots, by which the base address of the kernel is shifted. Normally, the kernel is loaded into a fixed physical address, which corresponds to a fixed virtual address in the VAS of the kernel. By introducing KASLR, all the kernel's memory, including its code, is shifted by this randomized offset, also known as a 'slide'," explains Beniamini. However, as he notes, since all of the kernel is shifted by a single slide value, "leaking any pointer in the kernel which resides at a known offset from the kernel's base address would allow us to easily calculate the slide's value". Beniamini says most Android devices correctly implement a function known as ktpr_restrict to hide a pointer's value using the anonymizing format specifier %pK, specifically with an upper case K. As Beniamini has previously highlighted, all kernel pointers printed using %pK are hidden. However, Samsung "rather amusingly" used a lowercase k. "This allows us to simply read the contents of pm_qos, and subtract the pointer's value from its known offset from the kernel's base address, thus giving us the value of the KASLR slide," he explains. Beniamini details three other RKP mitigations he got around, and several recommended steps Samsung could take to shield it from future attacks.

Android Wear 2.0 launched today to become the biggest evolution in Android smartwatches so far. Leading from the front are the LG Watch Style and the LG Watch Sport watches which launched alongside the new platform, becoming the first smartwatches to sport Android Wear 2.0. The update brings onboard a lot of much-awaited features including custom watch faces, standalone apps along with better support for iPhone users. Here we list out all the new features of Android Wear 2.0: STANDALONE APPS So far if you owned an Android Wear smartwatch, you’d have had to keep your Android phone nearby to make use of the Android Wear apps. If you had an iPhone, that made things even worse. With the new update, the biggest change in the smartwatch ecosystem is the support for standalone apps, which work straight out of the watch themselves without needing support from your smartphone. Using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or cellular connection, the smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0 has become more functional. The update will be a welcome change for iPhone users who for long lacked the app support needed to call an Android Wear watch a smartwatch. You can now download apps straight to your smartwatch, apps which Google has promised will be available in plenty overtime. Support for Android Wear 1.0 apps is also there. A DEDICATED PLAY STORE FOR WATCH APPS In tandem with opening up standalone support for apps in Android Wear watches, the platform will now also include its own exclusive app store, termed the Android Wear 2.0 Play Store. Now you can browse and install apps from the Play Store directly from your watch. As a result, you also don’t have to install the same app on your phone, as was the case before. ‘COMPLICATED’ WATCH FACES For a change, Android is playing catchup with Apple when it comes to smartwatches. Apple’s watchOS has the nifty feature of displaying data from third-party apps on the watch face, something which can be customised to fit your need. The same feature is now coming to Android Wear 2.0. Google is calling it ‘complications’. Now, your custom watch face will display data from Google Fit to Flipboard to Spotify. You can also interact with them on the Watch Face itself . You can also have multiple watch faces lined up side by side. Load up multiple watch faces with different complications and swipe sidewards to access them. You can have one each for work, for when you are commuting and finally, when you are home. NOTIFICATIONS MADE BETTER While notifications in the form of Google cards made the watch faces look cluttered a bit, Android Wear 2.0 looks to shake things up. Now, when you receive cards, the icons on the watch face will shrink and take up less space. There is also a progress bar on the bottom now, showing you how many cards are left for you to swipe. The watch also displays the card notifications for sometime when you raise the watch to activate it, before hiding away again. To access them again, just swipe from the bottom as you did with previous watches. The cards itself have received a face-lift. Earlier it used to be dark text on a white background. But Google tweaked it to show light text on a black background to save up on battery. MATERIAL DESIGN COMES TO ANDROID WATCHES With Android Wear 2.0, Material Design has finally come to smartwatches. And it’s not just a simple copy-paste from Android smartphone template. Google has specifically optimised the design for round-shaped watch faces. The app drawer has been redesigned to accommodate round screens better. Instead of swiping left and right to access apps, you can push the standby button to get all of them displayed in an arc along the round edge. You can rearrange your apps by holding and dragging them. In addition, Google has added a new action drawer at the bottom, similar to the context-specific gestures seen on a smartphone. The menus have also been easier to interact with. Android Wear 2.0 now supports rotational input, much like Samsung’s Gear S3’r rotating bezel. You can use a rotating panel to move up and down menus, zoom in and out, etc. OK GOOGLE ON SMARTWATCHES Wear 2.0 also brings support for Google Assistant, the AI-based digital assistant found in the Google Pixel phones. This enables you to talk to your watch to get answers. Ask about the weather, book a table in a restaurant, order coffee and more by holding down on the standby button or simply saying ‘OK Google’. IMPROVED TYPING ON SMARTWATCHES Watch screens are anyway too tiny for typing out anything significant. Nevertheless, if you wish to reply to mails and messages directly from your watch, Google is offering its native Gboard keyboard app with handwriting recognition to scribble out replies. You can swipe on the small keyboard to type out replies or even Google’s automated replies which are context-based. GET FIT WITH ANDROID WEAR 2.0 If the lack of support for fitness support was a complain in the earlier versions, Google is more than making up for it with this update. Google Fit is integrated more deeply now with additions of individual activity tracker. You can also launch your workout playlist from Spotify or any other music streaming apps directly from the watch without even turning on your phone.

When it came to specifics about Google's plan to bring Gigabit-speed Internet to Huntsville starting this year, information was shared, but limited. Check our website for updates, the crowd was advised. Part of the crowd at Coworking night in Huntsville to hear a presentation by Google Fiber. (Lee Roop/lroop@al.com)  "No big announcements, no news," Google's Caroline De Gantes said while opening her presentation to Huntsville's Coworking night. That was accurate, but the company did offer a few tidbits about how it will operate here. 1. Google will run fiber to the home from main fiber lines laid by Huntsville Utilities, and a Google installation technician will also run fiber into the home after consultation with homeowners about how they use the Internet. 2. Google will serve Huntsville first before considering any other out-of-city addresses. 3. De Gantes said Google Fiber's service is different from what other providers are now promising locally because of the company's "excellent customer experience." The choices now being offered locally are because Google Fiber is coming, she said. 4. Another Google representative said homeowners can expect a $5,000 increase in their homes' value if they add fiber optic cable. De Gantes' presentation was about what life in a Gig City might be like. She discussed the potential for small businesses to handle large amounts of data easily and share content with customers and collaborators. The experience is different in different cities, she said, adding, "We can't wait to see what you do with it." To demonstrate the possibilities, De Gantes played a video showing a concert recorded live with musicians in two different cities and vocalists in a third. The even ran seamlessly with "no lag time, no latency," in De Gantes' words. Expect Google Fiber to be active in the community and in the schools, De Gantes said. As an example, she pointed to Thursday night's sponsored screening of the film "Hidden Figures" at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center for kids from local Girl Scout troops, Girls, Inc., and Boys and Girls clubs.   Wednesday night's presentation was to Huntsville's weekly Coworking night for young entrepreneurs at Real Estate Row on University Drive. Coworking creator Chris Beaman said the event averages 550 people monthly who meet to network and work on startups.

Google Might Soon Remove Millions of Apps from the Play Store GO Google has sent notices to several developers Feb 9, 2017 12:39 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has started sending notices to developers worldwide, informing them of the intention to “limit visibility” or completely remove applications from the Play Store. Google seems to be targeting apps that violate the company’s User Data policy. Some app developers even lack a privacy policy and Google’s email even offers developers solutions to this issue, according to The Next Web. Google Play requires app developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the application requests or handles sensitive user or device information. App developers can either include a link to a valid privacy policy in their app’s store listing page or opt out of this requirement by removing any requests for sensitive permissions or user data. This way, Google wants to take action against thousands or even millions of applications that don’t abide by Play privacy requirements. Developers must resolve the issue by March 15 Google even provided app developers with a deadline for resolving the issue, they must either remove requests for user data or provide a valid privacy policy link until March 15, 2017. Google mentioned that, if developers don’t comply, their apps’ visibility will be limited or even completely removed. Google notice for app developers This measure is in the advantage of users foremost; as it makes sure that all apps abide by Play’s privacy policy and that so-called “zombie apps” would be removed. Such applications have been around for quite some time and haven’t received updates for years, while some were rendered useless by newer Android versions. The removal of such zombie apps would make it easier for users to find updated and solid applications by reducing the clutter in the Play Store when searching for certain keywords. This would also be for the benefit of developers of up-to-date applications. Starting March 15, Google might start putting these measures into effect and it would be interesting to see how many such apps will be removed, while the Play Store will become a bit more secure.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Google#Play Store#Android#Apps#Privacy policy subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Play Store (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news YouTube Go Is Here with Features for Watching Videos Offline Google Releases Android Wear 2.0, Here Is What's New Google Introduces Cloud Search Features to G Suite Business Users Google Not Giving Up on Plans to Launch Play Store in China Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One 2 photos    Google Play Store logo New Android APKs HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments BlackBerry Releases New Teaser for Mercury Announcement Ahead of MWC more on: BlackBerry i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Emily Dreyfuss Business Date of Publication: 02.09.17. 02.09.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Trump Can’t Stop the Globalization of Work—the Internet Will See to That Getty Images Donald Trump is promising to make America great again by keeping others out. That approach is already undermining the smidgen of tentative good will he had enjoyed from the tech industry. As a strategy for keeping jobs in the US, it’s also fatally flawed. Turns out that in a world connected by the internet, isolationism is just a glitch in the network that the system—in this case, the global economy—routes around. In the days since Trump signed his executive order limiting immigration from certain countries, tech employees who work in the US but were stuck outside the country have stayed in touch via email, videoconferencing, social media, and chat programs like Slack. In 2017, most of the day-to-day work that high-tech employees do takes place entirely on computers. Whether that computer is on Google’s campus in Mountain View or an airport in Tehran is largely irrelevant. Related Stories Doctors and Patients Reel After Trump’s Immigration Ban Trump’s Ban Isn’t Just Inhumane—It’ll Make America Dumber The Silicon Valley Engineers Driving the Anti-Trump Train “Remote work is clearly ready to take up the practical slack from Trump’s bans and walls when it comes to creative, intellectual work that can be done in front of a computer,” says David Heinemeier Hansson, co-creator of Ruby on Rails and an impassioned proponent of remote work. “That doesn’t make the restrictions any less wrong, but at least the internet provides a way to literally route around the damage.” Tech-enabled flexibility tamps down the disruptive potential of unexpected upheaval. It will also undermine any effort to make employing highly skilled foreign workers harder for tech companies, as Trump and Congress are both considering. Such restrictions will likely result in more employees working remotely, and more high-paying software jobs moving permanently offshore. Ultimately, entire companies may decide to relocate outside the US to countries more committed to the kind of openness so highly prized in the tech industry. “The unintended consequence of the proposed executive order and even the current one will be more US jobs being done overseas,” says Catharine Fisk, an international labor expert at the University of California, Irvine. Making Magic Anywhere Coding jobs are a prime target for outsourcing. It’s already common practice at firms both large and small. (Remember in Silicon Valley when Dinesh has a crush on the coder from Estonia?) But in recent years, the practice has been on the decline in the US. That’s a trend a crackdown in immigration could reverse. At the moment, tech companies take pains to keep workers in the same room together owing to the fashionable idea that physical proximity breeds creativity. Call it the Bell Labs ideal. “(Big tech firms) have spent more than a decade fighting for the outdated theory that people need to sit face-to-face in an overpriced Bay Area office to make ‘magic,'” Hansson says. But even if companies can’t be talked out of their physical fixation, they don’t need to make that magic in America. Maybe companies would rather keep teams physically intact than outsource some work. So what’s to stop them from outsourcing the entire company? “If they can’t bring the skilled workers to the US, presumably they could also just offshore the managers and designers and just move the entire production overseas,” Fisk says. ‘The internet provides a way to literally route around the damage.’ In some cases, that’s already happening. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Cisco have already opened hubs in Canada in order to avoid the confusing and restrictive immigration process in the US, the Wall Street Journal reports. In their amicus brief filed to the Ninth District Court of Appeals on Monday, a coalition of 97 tech companies warned that more such relocations could be coming. The Trump administration could fight back by imposing higher taxes on tech companies that outsource jobs or move tech hubs overseas—though how that would jibe with its stated goal of removing 75 percent of government regulations is unclear. A reluctance to embrace remote work could also catch some companies ill-prepared for possible new restrictions. Smaller firms and freelancers are able to be more nimble. “We are strongly against what is happening,” says Jake Frey, founder of the design firm Labs, who helped two UX designers stuck because of the ban find remote gigs while they waited to return to their lives in the US. “Two may not sound like a lot but in my opinion, two is already too many,” he adds. Bigger outfits may find they have a harder time adjusting as quickly, especially if the Trump administration keeps up the practice of dropping major policy changes with little preparation or consideration of the consequences. “Many of the larger tech companies, especially those from Silicon Valley, are ill-equipped ideologically to take advantage of this damage routing,” Hansson says. Large or small, however, the tech industry epitomizes the 21st century economy’s global sensibility. Success depends on skill, which gives companies an overwhelming incentive to seek out talent whatever the nationality. In a world connected by the internet, capitalism will find a way.

It all depends where you live. As YouTube Go is hiding in plain sight on the Google Play Store it would be rude not to give it at least a quick spin, right?! In September 2016 YouTube announced it was developing a new app aimed at people in developing countries Google Launches a New YouTube Go App for India Google Launches a New YouTube Go App for India Google has released a brand new YouTube app, called YouTube Go, which lets you watch and share videos offline. Read More . Called YouTube Go, this app offers the core YouTube experience without the excessive data usage associated with it. YouTube Goes Offline YouTube Go is designed to be offline first, and will function even when you aren’t connected to the internet. It’s also cost-effective, reducing data usage and putting you in control. It also offers a simple user interface and upfront video recommendations, potentially saving you time and trouble. In a nutshell, YouTube Go lets you: See which videos are trending and popular in your area. Download videos to watch offline later. Preview videos before you watch or save them. Choose your resolution before saving or streaming. Choose the amount of data to spend on each video. Share videos with others quickly without using any data. This App May Be Unstable YouTube Go is obviously aimed at people with underpowered phones, slow connection speeds, and/or restrictive data caps Why Do Data Caps Exist and How Can You Bypass Them?

Here's what we know. Read More . Which is why it’s being marketed in India and other developing countries. However, depending on where you live, you may be able to try it out right now by downloading the beta version from Google Play. This beta version comes with a warning that “This is an unreleased app. It may be unstable.” That’s probably just Google covering itself in case YouTube Go messes up your phone, but we’ll issue the same warning just in case.

According to the Economic Times, Google has won its first city wifi deal, which will put it in partnership with a number of tech players including IBM, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and RailTel. The contract is worth just over $20 million and was awarded by the Pune Smart City Development Corporation (PSCSCL) which oversees smart city initiatives in the area. While the connectivity business has been taking blows in the US, it does seem to be on a much healthier foundation in the fast growing Indian market. Prior to this deal, Google has been working with Indian Railways and RailTel to provide wifi at 400 railway stations across India, however this new development will see Google extend its reach to the rest of Pune, in areas such as malls, universities, cafes and transit stations. It’s another positive move in a very lucrative market. India has the second largest population in the world, with a median age of 27, with the seventh fastest growing economy and more than 237 million internet users (statistics courtesy of the CIA’s World Factbook). The country also has an increasingly wealthy and growing middle class, with internet uptake going upwards very quickly. According to the KPMG FICCI Media and Entertainment Industry Report, internet penetration is currently at 27%, though it expected to increase the number of users by at least 50 million annually. The US market may be stagnant, which is possibly one of the reasons Google faced difficulties, but the Indian market is growing, and growing fast. As part of the contract, Google will deploy its Google Station platform, focusing on the revenue side of things to ensure the initiative in self-sustaining, while RailTel will provide last-mile fibre connectivity to enable Wi-Fi hotspots at 200 locations across the city. Pune will collect 15-20% revenue generated through this citywide wifi network. Larsen & Toubro will sit at the top of the pile to help integrate everything together, and IBM will provide many of the smart city technology solutions to act as the backbone of the project. On the smart cities side of things, Google has done pretty well to get in on the ground floor of a very well-funded initiative in the country. The Indian ‘Smart Cities Mission’ is a government project to develop 109 cities, making them ‘citizen friendly and sustainable’. It has a bank balance of more than $15 billion. Pune is one of the first and most advanced, but it has been pretty successful so far; the roll out across India is only just beginning. While there are of course humanitarian aims here, Google was after all founded under the motto ‘don’t be evil’, the commercial gains could be quite significant for the search business as well. Sure, Google is just trying to democratize the internet, but if there has to be a default search engine, it might as well be Google, right?

The app tracks users’ activities and lifestyle to interpret it into an on-trend, custom-made dress. Google is the latest groundbreaking partnership for Ivyrevel, the world's first digital fashion house, that merges fashion creativity with technological innovation. The Data Dress is an initiative from Ivyrevel’s Fashion Tech Lab, committed to shaping the future of fashion. Users simply need to carry their phones and over the following week the dedicated app will use data technology to get to know their lifestyles. A truly unique Ivyrevel dress will be designed over the course of a week, using this knowledge of users’ lifestyles through Google’s technology. “It is such an exciting moment. We are about to change the fashion industry by bringing the customer’s personality into the design process through data technology,” said Aleksandar Subosic, co-founder of Ivyrevel. “To get a unique piece of clothing today you need to either buy a custom-made design piece or design it yourself, but that is generally not an affordable option and most people lack the design experience. The Data Dress enables women around the world to order a dress made entirely for them, that reflects the way they live their lives,” added Subosic. The statement dress is already at the heart of the Ivyrevel look, a style that is polished, bold and extrovert. The Data Dress takes a giant leap forward, using Google’s technology as part of the design process itself. As the week goes by, users will be able to watch the design of their dress evolve, as the app gets to know them even better and uses its knowledge to translate their lifestyle into a Data Dress. It is about couture techniques tailored to your story, from material and silhouette to unique details such as personalised embellishments. “The Android app specifically uses the Snapshot API within the platform to passively monitor each user’s daily activity and lifestyle with their permission. Where do you regularly eat out for dinner or hang out with friends? Are they more casual or formal meetups? What is the usual weather when you are outside? After the course of a week, the user’s context signals are passed through an algorithm that creates a digitally tailored dress design for the user to purchase,” says Google’s official Android Developers blog. The Android app is launching in closed alpha stage, and is currently being tested by selected global style influencers including Ivyrevel’s co-founder Kenza Zouiten.

Google finds out… When our robot overlords arrive, will they decide to kill us or cooperate with us? New research from DeepMind, Google parent Alphabet’s London-based artificial intelligence unit, could ultimately shed light on this fundamental question. By Jeremy Kahn. Added by Agency Staff on 9 February 2017. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Alphabet, DeepMind, Google Tweet When our robot overlords arrive, will they decide to kill us or cooperate with us? New research from DeepMind, Google parent Alphabet’s London-based artificial intelligence unit, could ultimately shed light on this fundamental question. They have been investigating the conditions in which reward-optimising beings, whether human or robot, would chose to cooperate, rather than compete. The answer could have implications for how computer intelligence may eventually be deployed to manage complex systems such as an economy, city traffic flows or environmental policy. Joel Leibo, the lead author of a paper DeepMind published online Thursday, said in an e-mail that his team’s research indicates that whether agents learn to cooperate or compete depends strongly on the environment in which they operate. While the research has no immediate real-world application, it would help DeepMind design artificial intelligence agents that can work together in environments with imperfect information. In the future, such work could help such agents navigate a world full of intelligent entities — both human and machine — whether in transport networks or stock markets. DeepMind’s paper describes how researchers used two different games to investigate how software agents learn to compete or cooperate. In the first, two of these agents had to maximise the number of apples they could gather in a two-dimensional digital environment. Researchers could vary how frequently apples appeared. The researchers found that when apples were scarce, the agents quickly learned to attack one another — zapping, or “tagging”, their opponent with a ray that temporarily immobilised them. When apples were abundant, the agents preferred to co-exist more peacefully. Rather chillingly, however, the researchers found when they tried this same game with more intelligent agents that drew on larger neural networks, a kind of machine intelligence designed to mimic how certain parts of the human brain work — they would “try to tag the other agent more frequently, ie behave less cooperatively, no matter how we vary the scarcity of apples”, they wrote in a blog post on DeepMind’s website. In a second game, called Wolfpack, the AI agents played wolves that had to learn to capture “prey”. Success resulted in a reward not just for the wolf making the capture, but for all wolves present within a certain radius of the capture. The more wolves present in this capture radius, the more points all the wolves would receive. In this game, the agents generally learned to cooperate. Unlike in the apple-gathering game, in Wolfpack the more cognitively advanced the agent was, the better it learned to cooperate. The researchers postulate that this is because in the apple-gathering game, the zapping behaviour was more complex — it requiring aiming the beam at the opponent; while in Wolfpack game, cooperation was the more complex behaviour. The researchers speculated that because the less sophisticated artificial intelligence systems had more difficulty mastering these complex behaviours, the more simple AI couldn’t learn to use them effectively. DeepMind, which Google purchased in 2014, is best known for having created an artificial intelligence that can beat the world’s top human players in the ancient Asian strategy game Go. In November, DeepMind announced it was working with Blizzard Entertainment, the division of Activision Blizzard that makes the videogame Starcraft II, to turn that game into a platform for AI research. Leibo said that the agents used in the apple-gathering and Wolfpack experiments had no short-term memory, and as a result could not make any inferences about the intent of the other agent. “Going forward it would be interesting to equip agents with the ability to reason about other agent’s beliefs and goals,” he said. In the meantime, it might be wise to keep a few spare apples around.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP   Share this article Tweet Jesus Google is scared to program the Quran into its AI platform as they believe the machines will want to kill us Davebee Nope, they wont, but the White Shirts surely will.

Credit: Google More like this Google desperately needs a simple messaging strategy Review: Google's new Pixel XL is a fine phone -- but is it really special? Why you should start using Google Keep right away Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing Table of Contents Voice calls Video calls Email Text messaging Social posting The bottom line Show More Is Google a good choice for communication? With the exception of email, Google is not considered a leader in person-to-person communication apps and services. Skype, owned by Microsoft, tops the video calling space. Facebook dominates social media. Slack leads business chat-room messaging. WhatsApp rules mobile messaging. And besides the big platforms from the big companies, hundreds of startups have created appealing and innovative communications apps and services. Google lags for a variety of reasons. Among these are confusion and uncertainty -- confusion about which app to use, uncertainty about whether Google will terminate any given product. Google offers 12 communications apps and services. Alphabetically, these are: Allo, Chat, Gmail, Google+, Groups, Hangouts, Inbox, Messenger, Duo, Project Fi, Spaces and Voice. If you look at the various communication actions you might want to take -- voice calls, video calls, email, text messaging and social posting -- Google has at least two offerings for each. The company is unrepentant about its bewildering lineup. A Google spokesperson told me: "We've designed specific products for distinct use cases, so we don't intend to have one app that does everything for everyone. We think we can better serve our users by creating products that function really well, and users can choose the product that best suits their needs." In other words, choice serves users better than clarity does. At the same time, the company has a longstanding habit of ditching old products and services that have seen limited success, including Google Wave, Google Reader, Picasa and many more. According to my informal survey of nearly 3,000 Google+ users, a majority (55% as of this writing) said they hesitate to use some Google products because they're afraid Google might kill them off. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Still, the tech giant appears unconcerned about its reputation for killing off products and the uncertainty that reputation engenders. The Google representative told me that delivering the "best experience" involves occasionally dropping products for the sake of focus. How to think about Google communication products The clarifying filter for understanding Google communication products is to consider legacy and the evolution of product direction. Every Google comms app can be categorized as new, old or ancient. That makes the choice easy, right? Just use the new one. Well, not so fast. There are some good reasons you might want to use an older Google product instead of a newer one. For starters, the new version may lack features that you enjoy in the old one. Simplification is the most conspicuous trend in social apps, and it's often achieved by the removal of specific controls. As a result, older versions are often better for power users. Plus, you might want to use an older version because that's where a specific community remains. All that said, Google’s communication products do have three Googly strengths: 1. Best-in-class artificial intelligence, 2. Best-in-class search, 3. Integration with other Google services. If you're one of the many users who want to take advantage of these powerful attributes, how do you approach the problem of choosing? If you want to embrace a text messaging app, should it be Allo, Hangouts, Messenger, Voice or Chat? If you're looking for an email service, do you choose Inbox or Gmail? And if you want to interact in a social networking context, should you use Google+, Spaces or Groups? Here's everything you need to know to understand, choose from, and make the best use of Google's many communications apps and services, broken down by function. Voice calls Google offers three ways to make phone calls via the internet (otherwise known as Voice-over-IP, or VoIP): Voice, Hangouts and Project Fi. All three enable calls to any phone number, and Google offers competitive international rates. Google Voice, which at eight years old is Google's oldest VoIP product, is available on the web and via iOS and Android apps. Mike Elgan / IDG Voice includes a free phone number for U.S. users. It's like a second phone on your existing phone. Voice includes a free phone number for U.S. users. In settings, you can instruct Voice to ring your home, work or cell phone -- or all three -- whenever someone calls your Voice number. Voice takes voicemails, which are not only available as audio files, but also transcribed and emailed to you. You can also block phone numbers, and when you block them, those callers hear a fake message saying the number is no longer in service. After five years with no major updates to its Voice apps, Google appeared to be slowly pushing Google Voice users toward Hangouts or encouraging them to sign up for the Fi service. For example, Voice users can choose in settings to receive SMS texts and voicemails in Hangouts instead of Voice. When a Voice user calls via Hangouts, the person called sees the Google Voice phone number in caller ID. And only people who use both Voice and Hangouts can receive calls on Hangouts from a landline or mobile phone originating outside the Hangouts system. Using both Voice and Hangouts improves the functionality of Hangouts. However, in January Google began rolling out an updated version of Voice with a more modern interface and new features, including group and multimedia texting. Seems there's life in the old app yet. [ Further reading: Microsoft Word vs. Google Docs: Which works better for business? ] Project Fi is best known as Google's mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), which means that Google acts as a mobile carrier but in fact resells the mobile services of actual carriers. Fi is currently available only to U.S. users who own one of four smartphone models (because special antennas are required): Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel. Mike Elgan / IDG With the Project Fi app, you can pause the service at any time and get fast tech support. Fi's best technical trick is to automatically switch between Wi-Fi calls or any of three U.S. carriers to provide the best connection. Fi also offers low data rates at home and abroad, plus a very straightforward billing plan that can be "paused" for up to three months at a time when you're not using it. Less well-known is the fact that when Voice users sign up to use Fi, their Voice phone number becomes the number for the phone, and their Voice account is essentially terminated and replaced by the Fi account. Google's third voice-calling product is Google Hangouts, the closest thing Google has to an all-in-one communications platform. VoIP calling is merely one of its features; it also supports video calls, instant messages and SMS texts. With Google's launch of Allo for instant messaging and Duo for video calling last summer, however, the company announced that it would refocus Hangouts as an enterprise tool. The company recently closed its Hangouts API for the refocus. Some business apps for Hangouts will remain, but the consumer apps are being terminated. Google is working to integrate Hangouts into the suite of business products formerly known as Google Apps, which the company recently rebranded "G Suite." Consumers will be nudged away from Hangouts toward Allo and Duo. The trouble is, these apps don't support phone calls. (Google wouldn't comment on the possibility of future Duo voice calling.) So, which Google app for internet phone calls? My advice: I recommend that every U.S. user take advantage of Google Voice. It's free and powerful. Whether you ultimately end up using another Google offering as your VoIP service, get Voice now and get the free phone number. I also recommend Project Fi for anyone who owns one of the four supporting Android phones -- or for anyone who travels abroad frequently. If you now use or plan to use G Suite in the future, Hangouts is a great choice. If you're not going to use Google's business suite but currently use Hangouts, keep using Hangouts for voice calls. (If Google eventually adds voice calling to Duo, you might want to switch at that point.) Video calls Google gives you two ways to make video calls: Duo and Hangouts. The Hangouts name originated with the group video chat feature of Google+. Some three years ago, Google removed the Hangouts video chat feature, the Google Chat voice calling feature and the Google Messenger messaging feature from Google+, and rolled them all into an app called Hangouts. IDG Hangouts offers video calls, voice calls and text chat from desktop web browsers as well as mobile devices. In August 2016, Google launched a new video calling product called Duo, which is available on iOS and Android. For one-to-one video calls, Duo is the best app out there if you want to video chat with, say, your technophobic parents. Just open the mobile app, tap the one button (labeled "Video call") and pick the person you're calling. If they have the app too, you'll be connected on a free, high-quality video call that fills the whole phone screen. Google For one-to-one video calls, Duo is the simplest app on the market. When you receive a call on Duo, you see the preview of the caller's video on the screen before you even answer the call, a feature called Knock Knock. On Android phones, you even see the Knock Knock preview on the lock screen. (Knock Knock can be disabled in settings.) Because one-to-one video calls on mobile devices is the only thing Duo does, Hangouts is currently better for other kinds of video calls, such as those made via a desktop web browser. Two more differences: Hangouts uses your Google account for identity, whereas Duo uses your phone number. And Duo calls use end-to-end encryption, so it's actually more secure than Hangouts. Duo's biggest downside is that it has fewer users than Skype, FaceTime or even Hangouts. So if you try to connect with a person in your Contacts list, chances are they'll have to install the app before you can connect. However, most consumers who use video chat tend to connect with the same small number of people, so once your family and friends have the app, it works great. Unlike Apple's FaceTime, which works only with Apple devices, Duo works across iOS and Android. If you or a family member or friend has Android, Duo is a nice option. Given Google's refocusing of Hangouts for the enterprise, it's possible that at some point in the future, consumers will no longer be able to use it. Right now, Google isn't saying -- nor is it revealing what additional features Duo will get down the line. My advice: For now, use Duo for one-to-one video calls and keep using Hangouts for all other video calls. Email Launched as a beta product in 2004, Gmail is (in technology terms) ancient, but has been recently upgraded with a modern interface. The two-year-old Inbox is the newer of Google's two email offerings, and has the advantage of artificial intelligence, making it easy to use. Mike Elgan / IDG The Smart Reply feature of Inbox gives three reply options you can choose from with a single tap. For example, the Smart Reply feature of Inbox, which is powered by advanced deep neural network machine learning, often gives you three reply options to a specific email message, which you can pick from by clicking on the best option. Google says about 10% of users' replies in Inbox are now made using Smart Reply. Inbox also intelligently bundles similar messages together, so you can dismiss them all with a single click, or process them together. It highlights events, such as trips, clustering together flight and hotel information. And you can even use Inbox to communicate with yourself, using reminders, assists and snooze messages or reminders based on date, time or even location. [ Further reading: 9 months later, how Google's Inbox finally won me over ] Generally, Inbox is far more intelligent, automated and easier to use than Gmail. And it's better integrated, too, with hooks into Google Keep and Google Calendar. Users report that the coveted status of "zero inbox" (when you empty your inbox every day) is easier to achieve with Inbox than with Gmail. Gmail, however, still gives users more direct access and control. Unlike Inbox, Gmail has an All Mail folder (where every single message appears), extensive options in Settings, including Filters and Blocked Addresses and experimental "Labs" add-ons. Power users love this stuff. Mike Elgan / IDG Gmail's busy Settings tabs are complex, but power users love the direct access and control. I asked Google if it plans to combined the ease-of-use features of Inbox with the power user options in Gmail -- or if it plans to phase out the older Gmail. A representative told me that Inbox was created not as a replacement for Gmail, but as an option and that the company plans to continue offering both. My advice: If you want easy, use Inbox. If you want control, use Gmail. Or do what many power users do and use both simultaneously or interchangeably based on daily needs for optimum control of email. Text messaging Google offers five ways to chat by text: Allo, Hangouts, Messenger, Voice and Chat. Let's start with the most elusive and mysterious of Google's messaging products: Google Chat. Before the standalone Hangouts app existed, you could do instant messaging and VoIP calls from Gmail and Google+ using Chat, but Google subsequently pushed users to the Hangouts app for those functions. (Note that Chat has also variously been called Google Talk, Gtalk, Gchat and Gmessage.) You can still use Chat in a web browser by going into Gmail, clicking your name in the left column, and then in the bottom frame of the pop-up menu clicking on "Revert to old Chat." But I don't recommend it. Hangouts offers more flexibility and a better user interface. I added Google Voice to this category because Voice offers straightforward SMS and MMS text messaging, including group messaging, which you can use in the mobile app or on the website. Mike Elgan / IDG Messenger is Google's best way to do text messaging. Sadly, it's for Android users only. Google's best app for SMS and MMS is Google Messenger. Messenger has a great interface, and supports pictures, GIFs, emoji and group texts. You can make it your default texting app, which means that when people text to your phone number, Messenger alerts you. And you can reply to incoming messages from the notifications themselves. However, Messenger is available only on Android. Hangouts supports messaging as well, including texting (but it doesn't support group SMS messaging). Some power users use Messenger for texting with their Android phone's number, and Hangouts for their Google Voice number. And, finally, there's Allo, Google's newest way to chat, which was launched in May 2016. The app is available for Android and iOS. The most unusual feature of Allo is artificial intelligence, which appears in two functions: You can chat with Google's virtual assistant (called, well, Google Assistant) and use the same Smart Reply technology found in Inbox. Allo also has all the messaging bells and whistles, including stickers, emoji, visual effects, GIFs and conversation-specific themes. It's likely that there will eventually be lots of third-party add-ons as well. Mike Elgan / IDG Allo has Google's Smart Reply function, but the app doesn't integrate gracefully with SMS. Controversially, Allo's end-to-end encryption is turned off by default, but you can turn it on by using an incognito mode, which also lets you make messages self-destructing and notifications private. Allo has two significant restrictions. First, it must be associated with a single phone. You can't use Allo on a tablet or laptop, and you can't use the same account on two phones. Second, Allo is awkward with SMS. You cannot set Allo as your phone's default SMS app. And when you try to send a message to a non-Allo user (which on other platforms simply fails over to straightforward SMS), the recipient gets a text message not from you, but from a weird proxy number and a message asking if they want to opt out. If they don't, you can exchange text messages. But they will always get the message from the proxy number, not yours. Allo is great for talking to the Google Assistant, and the best messaging app for talking to someone else who also uses Allo. But it's weak for the vast majority of people who don't use Allo strictly. My advice: If you're on Android, use Messenger. If you use G Suite, go ahead and use Hangouts for messaging. If you use Google Voice, then of course use Voice or Hangouts for text messages sent to the Voice number. And if you're on iOS and looking for an all-purpose messaging product, I would not recommend Google. Instead, choose Apple's Messages app or Facebook's WhatsApp or Messenger. All these alternatives give you all the bells and whistles, plus the ability to include SMS contacts gracefully. Social posting Google offers three completely different ways to post in social contexts: Spaces, Google+ and Groups -- the respective new, old and ancient ways of posting socially. The most unusual aspect of Google's social services is that they're all free and none of them has advertising. Google Groups is 16 years old! It's an all-purpose message board service for joining and engaging in threaded conversations on the web or via email. It also plugs into Usenet, which even predates the web. Mike Elgan / IDG Google Groups is what social networks were like before they were called social networks. The only reason to use Groups is if you have a holdout community that still uses the service. Some people still use Groups because at some point they joined a Group (because of some event or organization), and that's where the conversation remains. Google+ started in 2011 as the Mother of All Communications Networks. In Google+'s first couple of years, you could use the service to send email, text, make video calls, lifelog, edit and share photos and more. A few years ago, Google reversed its all-in-one approach and decided to pull out different communication features into separate apps. So the company stripped Plus for parts, spinning out Hangouts, Photos and other products. Today, Google+ is like a cross between Facebook and Reddit, which is to say, a social network like Facebook but centered around moderated interests and topics like Reddit. Mike Elgan / IDG Google+ content is organized by "Collections," which enable people to follow your content à la carte -- to get the posts they're interested in without getting the stuff they don't care about. Google+ content is organized by "Collections" (user-created categories of content that only the creator can post to, but which followers can follow individually -- so you can follow my "tech" posts without being subjected to my "food" posts) and "Communities," which are moderated user-created categories that others can join and all members can post to. Google's spokesperson told me that people are joining Communities at the rate of 1.6 million joins per day, and that Collections are growing even faster. Google Spaces, which is less than a year old, is the social service for people who hate social networks. It's not like Facebook, where you "follow" people and then get a filtered stream of what those people post. With Spaces, you invite people into individual conversations. Every conversation is an ad hoc island of interaction. Mike Elgan / IDG Google Spaces is like a social network, but you can't follow people. You can follow only individual conversations. In other words, unlike most social sites (including Google+), the network effect -- which says that the more people who use a product or service, the more valuable it is to everyone -- does not apply. Its usefulness is the same whether 100 people use it or a billion people do. Spaces is ideal for spinning out conversations from Twitter, Facebook, email or group messaging applications, where people can voluntarily engage without being restricted by Twitter's 140 characters or without subjecting victims to email Reply All madness. It's also a good place to share links with one person or a small group of people, even if you don't engage in a full-blown conversation. My advice: Avoid the antiquated Google Groups if you can. Use Google+ if you like to talk about your interests, passions, hobbies or business. And don't forget about Spaces. It's an all-purpose location to spin out conversations that start on other media. The bottom line I can't convince Google to consolidate and simplify its communication options. But I can offer my best advice for which products to choose and why. If you want easy and simple, use Messenger, Duo, Fi (if you have the right phone), Inbox and Spaces. And use your phone for voice calls. If you want power and control, use Gmail, Google+, Hangouts and Voice. I don't recommend Allo, Chat or Groups. Yes, Google's lineup of 12 communications apps and services is confusing. And, yes, Google has a reputation for terminating products. But for many, Google's amazing AI, search and integration are just too good to pass up.

By Sarmistha Acharya February 9, 2017 12:09 GMT Google announced two new smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0 LG The next iteration to Android Wear with version 2.0 will be available for all supported smartwatches in the coming weeks, Google has announced. It has even issued a list of compatible wearable devices that would receive Android Wear 2.0 including the ones coming from manufacturers like Asus, Huawei, LG, Motorola and more. For those eagerly waiting for the new Android Wear update, below is the list of top features and changes that Google has bundled to make the device more productive and improve the user experience. More personalisation with watch faces Android Wear 2.0 makes the smartwatch experience better with personalised watch faces that bring glanceable data. Just look at your watch to check out your next appointment, stock performance, progress on fitness goals or any other important things. You can even order an Uber ride, start a workout, get in touch with your favourite contact with just a quick tap on watch face. If you want to get different information throughout the day, just do a swipe to switch your watch faces. Tracking health activities The pre-installed app Google Fit now lets users track their pace, distance, calories burned and heart rate while walking, running or cycling. You can also check details about weight-lifting reps, push-ups, sit-ups and squats. Even during the work out, you can still receive messages and calls, stream tunes from Google Play Music and with the most important app on the watch face. Android Wear 2.0 apps The latest iteration of Android Wear lets you keep whichever app you want on the watch and download any of your favourite app directly from the Play Store. You can make calls and use the apps on the watch face, if your watch offers cellular connectivity. If you have an Android phone or iPhone, you can use the apps designed for Android Wear 2.0 such as AccuWeather, Android Pay, Bring!, Foursquare, Google Fit, Google Messenger, Google Play Music, Lifesum, Robinhood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Telegram, Uber and more. Fast messaging Another notable enhancement of the upgrade is fast messaging. It's now easier to read and respond to messages from the watch. When you get a message, expand the notification and tap to respond anyway you want by dictating, typing or handwriting, or drawing an emoji. Try out the improved messaging on apps like Facebook messenger, Glide, Google Messenger, Hangouts, Telegram or WhatsApp. When you want to respond to a message quickly, use Smart replay, which suggests responses based on the type of message you receive. Google Assistant to help you with everything Google's intelligent personal assistant, Google Assistant is now on your wrist. It is available in English and German on Android Wear. Google promises to add support for more languages in the coming months. Whether you want to set a reminder, or know about weather, Google Assistant can help you with everything. Just hold the Power button on your watch or say Ok Google to ask for help.

Here's how to understand, and choose from, Google's 12 communication apps and services. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 09 February, 2017 22:00 - - - - print email Comments Is Google a good choice for communication? With the exception of email, Google is not considered a leader in person-to-person communication apps and services. Skype, owned by Microsoft, tops the video calling space. Facebook dominates social media. Slack leads business chat-room messaging. WhatsApp rules mobile messaging. And besides the big platforms from the big companies, hundreds of startups have created appealing and innovative communications apps and services. Google lags for a variety of reasons. Among these are confusion and uncertainty -- confusion about which app to use, uncertainty about whether Google will terminate any given product. Google offers 12 communications apps and services. Alphabetically, these are: Allo, Chat, Gmail, Google+, Groups, Hangouts, Inbox, Messenger, Duo, Project Fi, Spaces and Voice. If you look at the various communication actions you might want to take -- voice calls, video calls, email, text messaging and social posting -- Google has at least two offerings for each. The company is unrepentant about its bewildering lineup. A Google spokesperson told me: "We've designed specific products for distinct use cases, so we don't intend to have one app that does everything for everyone. We think we can better serve our users by creating products that function really well, and users can choose the product that best suits their needs." In other words, choice serves users better than clarity does. At the same time, the company has a longstanding habit of ditching old products and services that have seen limited success, including Google Wave, Google Reader, Picasa and many more. According to my informal survey of nearly 3,000 Google+ users, a majority (55% as of this writing) said they hesitate to use some Google products because they're afraid Google might kill them off. Still, the tech giant appears unconcerned about its reputation for killing off products and the uncertainty that reputation engenders. The Google representative told me that delivering the "best experience" involves occasionally dropping products for the sake of focus. How to think about Google communication products The clarifying filter for understanding Google communication products is to consider legacy and the evolution of product direction. Every Google comms app can be categorized as new, old or ancient. That makes the choice easy, right? Just use the new one. Well, not so fast. There are some good reasons you might want to use an older Google product instead of a newer one. For starters, the new version may lack features that you enjoy in the old one. Simplification is the most conspicuous trend in social apps, and it's often achieved by the removal of specific controls. As a result, older versions are often better for power users. Plus, you might want to use an older version because that's where a specific community remains. All that said, Google’s communication products do have three Googly strengths: 1. Best-in-class artificial intelligence, 2. Best-in-class search, 3. Integration with other Google services. If you're one of the many users who want to take advantage of these powerful attributes, how do you approach the problem of choosing? If you want to embrace a text messaging app, should it be Allo, Hangouts, Messenger, Voice or Chat? If you're looking for an email service, do you choose Inbox or Gmail? And if you want to interact in a social networking context, should you use Google+, Spaces or Groups? Here's everything you need to know to understand, choose from, and make the best use of Google's many communications apps and services, broken down by function. Voice calls Google offers three ways to make phone calls via the internet (otherwise known as Voice-over-IP, or VoIP): Voice, Hangouts and Project Fi. All three enable calls to any phone number, and Google offers competitive international rates. Google Voice, which at eight years old is Google's oldest VoIP product, is available on the web and via iOS and Android apps. Mike Elgan / IDG Voice includes a free phone number for U.S. users. It's like a second phone on your existing phone. Voice includes a free phone number for U.S. users. In settings, you can instruct Voice to ring your home, work or cell phone -- or all three -- whenever someone calls your Voice number. Voice takes voicemails, which are not only available as audio files, but also transcribed and emailed to you. You can also block phone numbers, and when you block them, those callers hear a fake message saying the number is no longer in service. After five years with no major updates to its Voice apps, Google appeared to be slowly pushing Google Voice users toward Hangouts or encouraging them to sign up for the Fi service. For example, Voice users can choose in settings to receive SMS texts and voicemails in Hangouts instead of Voice. When a Voice user calls via Hangouts, the person called sees the Google Voice phone number in caller ID. And only people who use both Voice and Hangouts can receive calls on Hangouts from a landline or mobile phone originating outside the Hangouts system. Using both Voice and Hangouts improves the functionality of Hangouts. However, in January Google began rolling out an updated version of Voice with a more modern interface and new features, including group and multimedia texting. Seems there's life in the old app yet. [ Further reading: Microsoft Word vs. Google Docs: Which works better for business? ] Project Fi is best known as Google's mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), which means that Google acts as a mobile carrier but in fact resells the mobile services of actual carriers. Fi is currently available only to U.S. users who own one of four smartphone models (because special antennas are required): Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel. Mike Elgan / IDG With the Project Fi app, you can pause the service at any time and get fast tech support. Fi's best technical trick is to automatically switch between Wi-Fi calls or any of three U.S. carriers to provide the best connection. Fi also offers low data rates at home and abroad, plus a very straightforward billing plan that can be "paused" for up to three months at a time when you're not using it. Less well-known is the fact that when Voice users sign up to use Fi, their Voice phone number becomes the number for the phone, and their Voice account is essentially terminated and replaced by the Fi account. Google's third voice-calling product is Google Hangouts, the closest thing Google has to an all-in-one communications platform. VoIP calling is merely one of its features; it also supports video calls, instant messages and SMS texts. With Google's launch of Allo for instant messaging and Duo for video calling last summer, however, the company announced that it would refocus Hangouts as an enterprise tool. The company recently closed its Hangouts API for the refocus. Some business apps for Hangouts will remain, but the consumer apps are being terminated. Google is working to integrate Hangouts into the suite of business products formerly known as Google Apps, which the company recently rebranded "G Suite." Consumers will be nudged away from Hangouts toward Allo and Duo. The trouble is, these apps don't support phone calls. (Google wouldn't comment on the possibility of future Duo voice calling.) So, which Google app for internet phone calls? My advice: I recommend that every U.S. user take advantage of Google Voice. It's free and powerful. Whether you ultimately end up using another Google offering as your VoIP service, get Voice now and get the free phone number. I also recommend Project Fi for anyone who owns one of the four supporting Android phones -- or for anyone who travels abroad frequently. If you now use or plan to use G Suite in the future, Hangouts is a great choice. If you're not going to use Google's business suite but currently use Hangouts, keep using Hangouts for voice calls. (If Google eventually adds voice calling to Duo, you might want to switch at that point.) Video calls Google gives you two ways to make video calls: Duo and Hangouts. The Hangouts name originated with the group video chat feature of Google+. Some three years ago, Google removed the Hangouts video chat feature, the Google Chat voice calling feature and the Google Messenger messaging feature from Google+, and rolled them all into an app called Hangouts. IDG Hangouts offers video calls, voice calls and text chat from desktop web browsers as well as mobile devices. In August 2016, Google launched a new video calling product called Duo, which is available on iOS and Android. For one-to-one video calls, Duo is the best app out there if you want to video chat with, say, your technophobic parents. Just open the mobile app, tap the one button (labeled "Video call") and pick the person you're calling. If they have the app too, you'll be connected on a free, high-quality video call that fills the whole phone screen. Google For one-to-one video calls, Duo is the simplest app on the market. When you receive a call on Duo, you see the preview of the caller's video on the screen before you even answer the call, a feature called Knock Knock. On Android phones, you even see the Knock Knock preview on the lock screen. (Knock Knock can be disabled in settings.) Because one-to-one video calls on mobile devices is the only thing Duo does, Hangouts is currently better for other kinds of video calls, such as those made via a desktop web browser. Two more differences: Hangouts uses your Google account for identity, whereas Duo uses your phone number. And Duo calls use end-to-end encryption, so it's actually more secure than Hangouts. Duo's biggest downside is that it has fewer users than Skype, FaceTime or even Hangouts. So if you try to connect with a person in your Contacts list, chances are they'll have to install the app before you can connect. However, most consumers who use video chat tend to connect with the same small number of people, so once your family and friends have the app, it works great. Unlike Apple's FaceTime, which works only with Apple devices, Duo works across iOS and Android. If you or a family member or friend has Android, Duo is a nice option. Given Google's refocusing of Hangouts for the enterprise, it's possible that at some point in the future, consumers will no longer be able to use it. Right now, Google isn't saying -- nor is it revealing what additional features Duo will get down the line. My advice: For now, use Duo for one-to-one video calls and keep using Hangouts for all other video calls. Email Launched as a beta product in 2004, Gmail is (in technology terms) ancient, but has been recently upgraded with a modern interface. The two-year-old Inbox is the newer of Google's two email offerings, and has the advantage of artificial intelligence, making it easy to use. Mike Elgan / IDG The Smart Reply feature of Inbox gives three reply options you can choose from with a single tap. For example, the Smart Reply feature of Inbox, which is powered by advanced deep neural network machine learning, often gives you three reply options to a specific email message, which you can pick from by clicking on the best option. Google says about 10% of users' replies in Inbox are now made using Smart Reply. Inbox also intelligently bundles similar messages together, so you can dismiss them all with a single click, or process them together. It highlights events, such as trips, clustering together flight and hotel information. And you can even use Inbox to communicate with yourself, using reminders, assists and snooze messages or reminders based on date, time or even location. [ Further reading: 9 months later, how Google's Inbox finally won me over ] Generally, Inbox is far more intelligent, automated and easier to use than Gmail. And it's better integrated, too, with hooks into Google Keep and Google Calendar. Users report that the coveted status of "zero inbox" (when you empty your inbox every day) is easier to achieve with Inbox than with Gmail. Gmail, however, still gives users more direct access and control. Unlike Inbox, Gmail has an All Mail folder (where every single message appears), extensive options in Settings, including Filters and Blocked Addresses and experimental "Labs" add-ons. Power users love this stuff. Mike Elgan / IDG Gmail's busy Settings tabs are complex, but power users love the direct access and control. I asked Google if it plans to combined the ease-of-use features of Inbox with the power user options in Gmail -- or if it plans to phase out the older Gmail. A representative told me that Inbox was created not as a replacement for Gmail, but as an option and that the company plans to continue offering both. My advice: If you want easy, use Inbox. If you want control, use Gmail. Or do what many power users do and use both simultaneously or interchangeably based on daily needs for optimum control of email. Text messaging Google offers five ways to chat by text: Allo, Hangouts, Messenger, Voice and Chat. Let's start with the most elusive and mysterious of Google's messaging products: Google Chat. Before the standalone Hangouts app existed, you could do instant messaging and VoIP calls from Gmail and Google+ using Chat, but Google subsequently pushed users to the Hangouts app for those functions. (Note that Chat has also variously been called Google Talk, Gtalk, Gchat and Gmessage.) You can still use Chat in a web browser by going into Gmail, clicking your name in the left column, and then in the bottom frame of the pop-up menu clicking on "Revert to old Chat." But I don't recommend it. Hangouts offers more flexibility and a better user interface. I added Google Voice to this category because Voice offers straightforward SMS and MMS text messaging, including group messaging, which you can use in the mobile app or on the website. Mike Elgan / IDG Messenger is Google's best way to do text messaging. Sadly, it's for Android users only. Google's best app for SMS and MMS is Google Messenger. Messenger has a great interface, and supports pictures, GIFs, emoji and group texts. You can make it your default texting app, which means that when people text to your phone number, Messenger alerts you. And you can reply to incoming messages from the notifications themselves. However, Messenger is available only on Android. Hangouts supports messaging as well, including texting (but it doesn't support group SMS messaging). Some power users use Messenger for texting with their Android phone's number, and Hangouts for their Google Voice number. And, finally, there's Allo, Google's newest way to chat, which was launched in May 2016. The app is available for Android and iOS. The most unusual feature of Allo is artificial intelligence, which appears in two functions: You can chat with Google's virtual assistant (called, well, Google Assistant) and use the same Smart Reply technology found in Inbox. Allo also has all the messaging bells and whistles, including stickers, emoji, visual effects, GIFs and conversation-specific themes. It's likely that there will eventually be lots of third-party add-ons as well. Mike Elgan / IDG Allo has Google's Smart Reply function, but the app doesn't integrate gracefully with SMS. Controversially, Allo's end-to-end encryption is turned off by default, but you can turn it on by using an incognito mode, which also lets you make messages self-destructing and notifications private. Allo has two significant restrictions. First, it must be associated with a single phone. You can't use Allo on a tablet or laptop, and you can't use the same account on two phones. Second, Allo is awkward with SMS. You cannot set Allo as your phone's default SMS app. And when you try to send a message to a non-Allo user (which on other platforms simply fails over to straightforward SMS), the recipient gets a text message not from you, but from a weird proxy number and a message asking if they want to opt out. If they don't, you can exchange text messages. But they will always get the message from the proxy number, not yours. Allo is great for talking to the Google Assistant, and the best messaging app for talking to someone else who also uses Allo. But it's weak for the vast majority of people who don't use Allo strictly. My advice: If you're on Android, use Messenger. If you use G Suite, go ahead and use Hangouts for messaging. If you use Google Voice, then of course use Voice or Hangouts for text messages sent to the Voice number. And if you're on iOS and looking for an all-purpose messaging product, I would not recommend Google. Instead, choose Apple's Messages app or Facebook's WhatsApp or Messenger. All these alternatives give you all the bells and whistles, plus the ability to include SMS contacts gracefully. Social posting Google offers three completely different ways to post in social contexts: Spaces, Google+ and Groups -- the respective new, old and ancient ways of posting socially. The most unusual aspect of Google's social services is that they're all free and none of them has advertising. Google Groups is 16 years old! It's an all-purpose message board service for joining and engaging in threaded conversations on the web or via email. It also plugs into Usenet, which even predates the web. Mike Elgan / IDG Google Groups is what social networks were like before they were called social networks. The only reason to use Groups is if you have a holdout community that still uses the service. Some people still use Groups because at some point they joined a Group (because of some event or organization), and that's where the conversation remains. Google+ started in 2011 as the Mother of All Communications Networks. In Google+'s first couple of years, you could use the service to send email, text, make video calls, lifelog, edit and share photos and more. A few years ago, Google reversed its all-in-one approach and decided to pull out different communication features into separate apps. So the company stripped Plus for parts, spinning out Hangouts, Photos and other products. Today, Google+ is like a cross between Facebook and Reddit, which is to say, a social network like Facebook but centered around moderated interests and topics like Reddit. Mike Elgan / IDG Google+ content is organized by "Collections," which enable people to follow your content à la carte -- to get the posts they're interested in without getting the stuff they don't care about. Google+ content is organized by "Collections" (user-created categories of content that only the creator can post to, but which followers can follow individually -- so you can follow my "tech" posts without being subjected to my "food" posts) and "Communities," which are moderated user-created categories that others can join and all members can post to. Google's spokesperson told me that people are joining Communities at the rate of 1.6 million joins per day, and that Collections are growing even faster. Google Spaces, which is less than a year old, is the social service for people who hate social networks. It's not like Facebook, where you "follow" people and then get a filtered stream of what those people post. With Spaces, you invite people into individual conversations. Every conversation is an ad hoc island of interaction. Mike Elgan / IDG Google Spaces is like a social network, but you can't follow people. You can follow only individual conversations. In other words, unlike most social sites (including Google+), the network effect -- which says that the more people who use a product or service, the more valuable it is to everyone -- does not apply. Its usefulness is the same whether 100 people use it or a billion people do. Spaces is ideal for spinning out conversations from Twitter, Facebook, email or group messaging applications, where people can voluntarily engage without being restricted by Twitter's 140 characters or without subjecting victims to email Reply All madness. It's also a good place to share links with one person or a small group of people, even if you don't engage in a full-blown conversation. My advice: Avoid the antiquated Google Groups if you can. Use Google+ if you like to talk about your interests, passions, hobbies or business. And don't forget about Spaces. It's an all-purpose location to spin out conversations that start on other media. The bottom line I can't convince Google to consolidate and simplify its communication options. But I can offer my best advice for which products to choose and why. If you want easy and simple, use Messenger, Duo, Fi (if you have the right phone), Inbox and Spaces. And use your phone for voice calls. If you want power and control, use Gmail, Google+, Hangouts and Voice. I don't recommend Allo, Chat or Groups. Yes, Google's lineup of 12 communications apps and services is confusing. And, yes, Google has a reputation for terminating products. But for many, Google's amazing AI, search and integration are just too good to pass up.

Here's how to understand, and choose from, Google's 12 communication apps and services. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 09 February, 2017 22:00 - - - - print email Comments Is Google a good choice for communication? With the exception of email, Google is not considered a leader in person-to-person communication apps and services. Skype, owned by Microsoft, tops the video calling space. Facebook dominates social media. Slack leads business chat-room messaging. WhatsApp rules mobile messaging. And besides the big platforms from the big companies, hundreds of startups have created appealing and innovative communications apps and services. Google lags for a variety of reasons. Among these are confusion and uncertainty -- confusion about which app to use, uncertainty about whether Google will terminate any given product. Google offers 12 communications apps and services. Alphabetically, these are: Allo, Chat, Gmail, Google+, Groups, Hangouts, Inbox, Messenger, Duo, Project Fi, Spaces and Voice. If you look at the various communication actions you might want to take -- voice calls, video calls, email, text messaging and social posting -- Google has at least two offerings for each. The company is unrepentant about its bewildering lineup. A Google spokesperson told me: "We've designed specific products for distinct use cases, so we don't intend to have one app that does everything for everyone. We think we can better serve our users by creating products that function really well, and users can choose the product that best suits their needs." In other words, choice serves users better than clarity does. At the same time, the company has a longstanding habit of ditching old products and services that have seen limited success, including Google Wave, Google Reader, Picasa and many more. According to my informal survey of nearly 3,000 Google+ users, a majority (55% as of this writing) said they hesitate to use some Google products because they're afraid Google might kill them off. Still, the tech giant appears unconcerned about its reputation for killing off products and the uncertainty that reputation engenders. The Google representative told me that delivering the "best experience" involves occasionally dropping products for the sake of focus. How to think about Google communication products The clarifying filter for understanding Google communication products is to consider legacy and the evolution of product direction. Every Google comms app can be categorized as new, old or ancient. That makes the choice easy, right? Just use the new one. Well, not so fast. There are some good reasons you might want to use an older Google product instead of a newer one. For starters, the new version may lack features that you enjoy in the old one. Simplification is the most conspicuous trend in social apps, and it's often achieved by the removal of specific controls. As a result, older versions are often better for power users. Plus, you might want to use an older version because that's where a specific community remains. All that said, Google’s communication products do have three Googly strengths: 1. Best-in-class artificial intelligence, 2. Best-in-class search, 3. Integration with other Google services. If you're one of the many users who want to take advantage of these powerful attributes, how do you approach the problem of choosing? If you want to embrace a text messaging app, should it be Allo, Hangouts, Messenger, Voice or Chat? If you're looking for an email service, do you choose Inbox or Gmail? And if you want to interact in a social networking context, should you use Google+, Spaces or Groups? Here's everything you need to know to understand, choose from, and make the best use of Google's many communications apps and services, broken down by function. Voice calls Google offers three ways to make phone calls via the internet (otherwise known as Voice-over-IP, or VoIP): Voice, Hangouts and Project Fi. All three enable calls to any phone number, and Google offers competitive international rates. Google Voice, which at eight years old is Google's oldest VoIP product, is available on the web and via iOS and Android apps. Mike Elgan / IDG Voice includes a free phone number for U.S. users. It's like a second phone on your existing phone. Voice includes a free phone number for U.S. users. In settings, you can instruct Voice to ring your home, work or cell phone -- or all three -- whenever someone calls your Voice number. Voice takes voicemails, which are not only available as audio files, but also transcribed and emailed to you. You can also block phone numbers, and when you block them, those callers hear a fake message saying the number is no longer in service. After five years with no major updates to its Voice apps, Google appeared to be slowly pushing Google Voice users toward Hangouts or encouraging them to sign up for the Fi service. For example, Voice users can choose in settings to receive SMS texts and voicemails in Hangouts instead of Voice. When a Voice user calls via Hangouts, the person called sees the Google Voice phone number in caller ID. And only people who use both Voice and Hangouts can receive calls on Hangouts from a landline or mobile phone originating outside the Hangouts system. Using both Voice and Hangouts improves the functionality of Hangouts. However, in January Google began rolling out an updated version of Voice with a more modern interface and new features, including group and multimedia texting. Seems there's life in the old app yet. [ Further reading: Microsoft Word vs. Google Docs: Which works better for business? ] Project Fi is best known as Google's mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), which means that Google acts as a mobile carrier but in fact resells the mobile services of actual carriers. Fi is currently available only to U.S. users who own one of four smartphone models (because special antennas are required): Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel. Mike Elgan / IDG With the Project Fi app, you can pause the service at any time and get fast tech support. Fi's best technical trick is to automatically switch between Wi-Fi calls or any of three U.S. carriers to provide the best connection. Fi also offers low data rates at home and abroad, plus a very straightforward billing plan that can be "paused" for up to three months at a time when you're not using it. Less well-known is the fact that when Voice users sign up to use Fi, their Voice phone number becomes the number for the phone, and their Voice account is essentially terminated and replaced by the Fi account. Google's third voice-calling product is Google Hangouts, the closest thing Google has to an all-in-one communications platform. VoIP calling is merely one of its features; it also supports video calls, instant messages and SMS texts. With Google's launch of Allo for instant messaging and Duo for video calling last summer, however, the company announced that it would refocus Hangouts as an enterprise tool. The company recently closed its Hangouts API for the refocus. Some business apps for Hangouts will remain, but the consumer apps are being terminated. Google is working to integrate Hangouts into the suite of business products formerly known as Google Apps, which the company recently rebranded "G Suite." Consumers will be nudged away from Hangouts toward Allo and Duo. The trouble is, these apps don't support phone calls. (Google wouldn't comment on the possibility of future Duo voice calling.) So, which Google app for internet phone calls? My advice: I recommend that every U.S. user take advantage of Google Voice. It's free and powerful. Whether you ultimately end up using another Google offering as your VoIP service, get Voice now and get the free phone number. I also recommend Project Fi for anyone who owns one of the four supporting Android phones -- or for anyone who travels abroad frequently. If you now use or plan to use G Suite in the future, Hangouts is a great choice. If you're not going to use Google's business suite but currently use Hangouts, keep using Hangouts for voice calls. (If Google eventually adds voice calling to Duo, you might want to switch at that point.) Video calls Google gives you two ways to make video calls: Duo and Hangouts. The Hangouts name originated with the group video chat feature of Google+. Some three years ago, Google removed the Hangouts video chat feature, the Google Chat voice calling feature and the Google Messenger messaging feature from Google+, and rolled them all into an app called Hangouts. IDG Hangouts offers video calls, voice calls and text chat from desktop web browsers as well as mobile devices. In August 2016, Google launched a new video calling product called Duo, which is available on iOS and Android. For one-to-one video calls, Duo is the best app out there if you want to video chat with, say, your technophobic parents. Just open the mobile app, tap the one button (labeled "Video call") and pick the person you're calling. If they have the app too, you'll be connected on a free, high-quality video call that fills the whole phone screen. Google For one-to-one video calls, Duo is the simplest app on the market. When you receive a call on Duo, you see the preview of the caller's video on the screen before you even answer the call, a feature called Knock Knock. On Android phones, you even see the Knock Knock preview on the lock screen. (Knock Knock can be disabled in settings.) Because one-to-one video calls on mobile devices is the only thing Duo does, Hangouts is currently better for other kinds of video calls, such as those made via a desktop web browser. Two more differences: Hangouts uses your Google account for identity, whereas Duo uses your phone number. And Duo calls use end-to-end encryption, so it's actually more secure than Hangouts. Duo's biggest downside is that it has fewer users than Skype, FaceTime or even Hangouts. So if you try to connect with a person in your Contacts list, chances are they'll have to install the app before you can connect. However, most consumers who use video chat tend to connect with the same small number of people, so once your family and friends have the app, it works great. Unlike Apple's FaceTime, which works only with Apple devices, Duo works across iOS and Android. If you or a family member or friend has Android, Duo is a nice option. Given Google's refocusing of Hangouts for the enterprise, it's possible that at some point in the future, consumers will no longer be able to use it. Right now, Google isn't saying -- nor is it revealing what additional features Duo will get down the line. My advice: For now, use Duo for one-to-one video calls and keep using Hangouts for all other video calls. Email Launched as a beta product in 2004, Gmail is (in technology terms) ancient, but has been recently upgraded with a modern interface. The two-year-old Inbox is the newer of Google's two email offerings, and has the advantage of artificial intelligence, making it easy to use. Mike Elgan / IDG The Smart Reply feature of Inbox gives three reply options you can choose from with a single tap. For example, the Smart Reply feature of Inbox, which is powered by advanced deep neural network machine learning, often gives you three reply options to a specific email message, which you can pick from by clicking on the best option. Google says about 10% of users' replies in Inbox are now made using Smart Reply. Inbox also intelligently bundles similar messages together, so you can dismiss them all with a single click, or process them together. It highlights events, such as trips, clustering together flight and hotel information. And you can even use Inbox to communicate with yourself, using reminders, assists and snooze messages or reminders based on date, time or even location. [ Further reading: 9 months later, how Google's Inbox finally won me over ] Generally, Inbox is far more intelligent, automated and easier to use than Gmail. And it's better integrated, too, with hooks into Google Keep and Google Calendar. Users report that the coveted status of "zero inbox" (when you empty your inbox every day) is easier to achieve with Inbox than with Gmail. Gmail, however, still gives users more direct access and control. Unlike Inbox, Gmail has an All Mail folder (where every single message appears), extensive options in Settings, including Filters and Blocked Addresses and experimental "Labs" add-ons. Power users love this stuff. Mike Elgan / IDG Gmail's busy Settings tabs are complex, but power users love the direct access and control. I asked Google if it plans to combined the ease-of-use features of Inbox with the power user options in Gmail -- or if it plans to phase out the older Gmail. A representative told me that Inbox was created not as a replacement for Gmail, but as an option and that the company plans to continue offering both. My advice: If you want easy, use Inbox. If you want control, use Gmail. Or do what many power users do and use both simultaneously or interchangeably based on daily needs for optimum control of email. Text messaging Google offers five ways to chat by text: Allo, Hangouts, Messenger, Voice and Chat. Let's start with the most elusive and mysterious of Google's messaging products: Google Chat. Before the standalone Hangouts app existed, you could do instant messaging and VoIP calls from Gmail and Google+ using Chat, but Google subsequently pushed users to the Hangouts app for those functions. (Note that Chat has also variously been called Google Talk, Gtalk, Gchat and Gmessage.) You can still use Chat in a web browser by going into Gmail, clicking your name in the left column, and then in the bottom frame of the pop-up menu clicking on "Revert to old Chat." But I don't recommend it. Hangouts offers more flexibility and a better user interface. I added Google Voice to this category because Voice offers straightforward SMS and MMS text messaging, including group messaging, which you can use in the mobile app or on the website. Mike Elgan / IDG Messenger is Google's best way to do text messaging. Sadly, it's for Android users only. Google's best app for SMS and MMS is Google Messenger. Messenger has a great interface, and supports pictures, GIFs, emoji and group texts. You can make it your default texting app, which means that when people text to your phone number, Messenger alerts you. And you can reply to incoming messages from the notifications themselves. However, Messenger is available only on Android. Hangouts supports messaging as well, including texting (but it doesn't support group SMS messaging). Some power users use Messenger for texting with their Android phone's number, and Hangouts for their Google Voice number. And, finally, there's Allo, Google's newest way to chat, which was launched in May 2016. The app is available for Android and iOS. The most unusual feature of Allo is artificial intelligence, which appears in two functions: You can chat with Google's virtual assistant (called, well, Google Assistant) and use the same Smart Reply technology found in Inbox. Allo also has all the messaging bells and whistles, including stickers, emoji, visual effects, GIFs and conversation-specific themes. It's likely that there will eventually be lots of third-party add-ons as well. Mike Elgan / IDG Allo has Google's Smart Reply function, but the app doesn't integrate gracefully with SMS. Controversially, Allo's end-to-end encryption is turned off by default, but you can turn it on by using an incognito mode, which also lets you make messages self-destructing and notifications private. Allo has two significant restrictions. First, it must be associated with a single phone. You can't use Allo on a tablet or laptop, and you can't use the same account on two phones. Second, Allo is awkward with SMS. You cannot set Allo as your phone's default SMS app. And when you try to send a message to a non-Allo user (which on other platforms simply fails over to straightforward SMS), the recipient gets a text message not from you, but from a weird proxy number and a message asking if they want to opt out. If they don't, you can exchange text messages. But they will always get the message from the proxy number, not yours. Allo is great for talking to the Google Assistant, and the best messaging app for talking to someone else who also uses Allo. But it's weak for the vast majority of people who don't use Allo strictly. My advice: If you're on Android, use Messenger. If you use G Suite, go ahead and use Hangouts for messaging. If you use Google Voice, then of course use Voice or Hangouts for text messages sent to the Voice number. And if you're on iOS and looking for an all-purpose messaging product, I would not recommend Google. Instead, choose Apple's Messages app or Facebook's WhatsApp or Messenger. All these alternatives give you all the bells and whistles, plus the ability to include SMS contacts gracefully. Social posting Google offers three completely different ways to post in social contexts: Spaces, Google+ and Groups -- the respective new, old and ancient ways of posting socially. The most unusual aspect of Google's social services is that they're all free and none of them has advertising. Google Groups is 16 years old! It's an all-purpose message board service for joining and engaging in threaded conversations on the web or via email. It also plugs into Usenet, which even predates the web. Mike Elgan / IDG Google Groups is what social networks were like before they were called social networks. The only reason to use Groups is if you have a holdout community that still uses the service. Some people still use Groups because at some point they joined a Group (because of some event or organization), and that's where the conversation remains. Google+ started in 2011 as the Mother of All Communications Networks. In Google+'s first couple of years, you could use the service to send email, text, make video calls, lifelog, edit and share photos and more. A few years ago, Google reversed its all-in-one approach and decided to pull out different communication features into separate apps. So the company stripped Plus for parts, spinning out Hangouts, Photos and other products. Today, Google+ is like a cross between Facebook and Reddit, which is to say, a social network like Facebook but centered around moderated interests and topics like Reddit. Mike Elgan / IDG Google+ content is organized by "Collections," which enable people to follow your content à la carte -- to get the posts they're interested in without getting the stuff they don't care about. Google+ content is organized by "Collections" (user-created categories of content that only the creator can post to, but which followers can follow individually -- so you can follow my "tech" posts without being subjected to my "food" posts) and "Communities," which are moderated user-created categories that others can join and all members can post to. Google's spokesperson told me that people are joining Communities at the rate of 1.6 million joins per day, and that Collections are growing even faster. Google Spaces, which is less than a year old, is the social service for people who hate social networks. It's not like Facebook, where you "follow" people and then get a filtered stream of what those people post. With Spaces, you invite people into individual conversations. Every conversation is an ad hoc island of interaction. Mike Elgan / IDG Google Spaces is like a social network, but you can't follow people. You can follow only individual conversations. In other words, unlike most social sites (including Google+), the network effect -- which says that the more people who use a product or service, the more valuable it is to everyone -- does not apply. Its usefulness is the same whether 100 people use it or a billion people do. Spaces is ideal for spinning out conversations from Twitter, Facebook, email or group messaging applications, where people can voluntarily engage without being restricted by Twitter's 140 characters or without subjecting victims to email Reply All madness. It's also a good place to share links with one person or a small group of people, even if you don't engage in a full-blown conversation. My advice: Avoid the antiquated Google Groups if you can. Use Google+ if you like to talk about your interests, passions, hobbies or business. And don't forget about Spaces. It's an all-purpose location to spin out conversations that start on other media. The bottom line I can't convince Google to consolidate and simplify its communication options. But I can offer my best advice for which products to choose and why. If you want easy and simple, use Messenger, Duo, Fi (if you have the right phone), Inbox and Spaces. And use your phone for voice calls. If you want power and control, use Gmail, Google+, Hangouts and Voice. I don't recommend Allo, Chat or Groups. Yes, Google's lineup of 12 communications apps and services is confusing. And, yes, Google has a reputation for terminating products. But for many, Google's amazing AI, search and integration are just too good to pass up. Join the TechWorld newsletter!

Marshmallow Features Thanks to the roll outs and the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow roll out, we know what the Marshmallow update brings to the flagship devices. As expected, Marshmallow brings changes to the update’s interface. The update replaces blue with white and it changes the look of several app icons. The update also features the popular Google Now on Tap feature that allows you to quickly bring up information on whatever you’re looking at simply by holding down the home button. It’s one of our favorite Marshmallow features. The video above outlines the key features.

The Samsung Galaxy S5 mini Android Marshmallow update just appeared at the Wi-Fi Alliance, a sign that its release is getting closer. It also looks like the instruction manual is now available, another sign that we’re getting close. The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active Marshmallow update is finally starting to roll out in the United States. AT&T recently released the upgrade and it brings a familiar set of features and enhancements to the rugged version of the Galaxy S5. From its website: Android OS 6.0 (Marshmallow) Wi-Fi Calling Video Calling Android device security enhancements Features As for the Galaxy S5 Marshmallow update, it comes with most of Marshmallow’s features with bug fixes, improvements to the device’s speed, and improvements to stability. The video above gives you a good look at what to expect from your Galaxy S5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update. Those of you with a carrier-branded model can expect some unique “enhancements” and fixes so you’ll want to dig into the change log when your update arrives. Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow Update The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is now being deployed to devices around the world. It’s rolling out in a number of other countries including India with the Middle East an apparent focus for Samsung right now. It’s also rolling out in Algeria, Brazil, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Malaysia, Pakistan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Australia (Optus) to name a few. U.S. and Canadian carriers are also in the mix. The Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update is available and it brings new features and enhancements to its version of the flagship smartphone. The carrier is also rolling out a smaller bug fixer that alleviates three problems with Marshmallow: Trouble connecting to the internet Frequent data disconnection Problems while loading files or web pages Sprint is also rolling out the Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update to users taking the flagship phone up from Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. As expected, the change log is similar to the other Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow updates that’ve rolled out elsewhere in the U.S. and around the world. Like the others, it comes with a number of enhancements, features and fixes. Elsewhere in North America, U.S. Cellular’s confirmed a Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow roll out via its website. Like its Galaxy S6 updates, the listing contains a link to download via Samsung’s Kies app for PC. T-Mobile is also rolling out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow to the Galaxy Note 5. The update should be available to all users right now. The AT&T Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update is also rolling out to users around the country. Samsung recently updated its version of the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update with several improvements including Wi-Fi calling and Advanced Messaging. The update also delivers new security patches.

In Australia, popular carrier Vodafone is pushing out a Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 update. So is fellow Australian carrier Telstra. Features Thanks to the public roll out, we know what’s on board the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. The video below shows off the Galaxy Note 5’s Marshmallow software and it runs down many of the important changes. For more on the Marshmallow leak, take a look at this full rundown from XDA-Developers. It reviews the update’s early performance. For a set of photos, take a look at these Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow photos. Verizon’s run down of the Marshmallow update will also give you a feel for the changes. In addition to these positive changes, it’s worth nothing that the Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 update is plagued with issues including battery drain, issues with Gear VR and other smaller bugs. These issues have extended to the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.o.1 update. Verizon users are already starting to complain about battery drain, Wi-Fi problems and more. We expect complaints to pick up as the roll out picks up speed. It’s not clear how these problems will impact the overall speed of the roll out (it doesn’t appear to have slowed it down yet) but Galaxy Note 5 users will want to be cautious when Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow arrives. Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow Update The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Marshmallow updates are rolling out right now. Sprint is pushing out its version of the Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update right now. The U.S. Cellular Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update appears to be rolling out as well. U.S. Cellular’s website confirms the release of its Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 update. The update mirrors the other Galaxy Note 4 updates in the United States. Verizon is also rolling out its version of the Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 update. According to Big Red, the update “has been tested to optimize device performance, resolve known issues and apply the latest security patches.” The Verizon Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out bringing new features, security patches and bug fixes to the curved version of the Galaxy Note 4. After a long wait, AT&T is also rolling out its Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates. Both updates feature: Android Marshmallow Operating System Video Calling Advanced Messaging Wi-Fi Calling And finally, T-Mobile is rolling out both the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates to its user base. The carrier’s updates bring new features but they also bring bug fixes and enhancements that should help to stabilize the software on board. In Canada, Rogers confirms it’s finally rolling out its version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 update. As for the rest of the world, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is rolling out in Europe for the SM-N910C in Poland, users in Croatia, Germany, Korea, Austria, Italy, and its available for Galaxy Note 4 users in Uzbekistan (SM-N910H). Samsung is rolling out a new Android 6.0.1 build to the aging former flagship in India. Marshmallow is also now pushing out for Galaxy Note 4 models in Australia. Those with the Galaxy Note 4 there should check to see if an OTA is available. As for the Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update, it’s pushing out in England. It also looks like it’s starting to roll out to the unlocked version of the Galaxy Note Edge in other parts of Europe and to models in Canada. It’s moving like a slug compared to Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow roll out for the Galaxy Note 4 but we expect it to pick up speed in the weeks ahead. Features Thanks to these roll outs, we know what the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update looks like. The Galaxy Note 4 update comes with the new Air Command menu that’s found on the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. There are also some new icons for applications. Similar to the Samsung Galaxy S6’s update. It also comes with the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 feature that allows you to take notes when the screen is off. Others In addition to updates for these popular devices, Samsung is rolling out a number of other Marshmallow updates around the world. Samsung is now pushing the Android 6.0.1 update to the Galaxy A9, a 6-inch smartphone that’s available in limited markets. The Galaxy A9 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is available for the SM-A9000 model in China. The company’s also deployed the first Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 Marshmallow updates. The Android 6.0.1 software is rolling out to Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 models in Russia. The A7 update is also pushing out in Europe. The Galaxy A5 Marshmallow update is also pushing out to Canadian users. Telus recently confirmed the start of the roll out. Look for both of these updates to pick up speed in the weeks ahead. The update is also rolling out to Samsung’s budget line of devices. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update has made its way over to the Galaxy J5 in India and Europe. Like Samsung’s other Marshmallow upgrades, it brings some huge changes to the device. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S2 Android 6.0.1 update has started to roll out. The upgrade rolling out right now in Germany for the 9-inch model. It brings well-known Marshmallow features and it also brings a multi-user mode. This mode allows you to create separate accounts for family members and friends. A few more notes: The Galaxy Tab S2 9-inch Marshmallow update is also pushing for the 4G model in the Netherlands. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is now rolling out for the 8-inch Galaxy Tab S2 in the United Kingdom. The update is similar to the upgrade for the larger version. Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out to the Galaxy Tab S2 on Rogers in Canada and Verizon in the United States. The Galaxy Tab S2 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update has also landed for the Wi-Fi only versions of the 8-inch and 9-inch models in the U.S. The AT&T Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update is rolling out right now. T-Mobile is also rolling out a Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update in the United States. The update should be available OTA right now. Verizon is also now rolling out a Galaxy Tab E 8.0 Marshmallow update. It’s similar to the other Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates for Big Red and those who own this relatively new tablet are encouraged to check for the update right now. Android Marshmallow is also rolling out the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4. The update is currently available for the Wi-Fi model in Europe. As for the rest of Samsung’s tablet line, the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out for the first time to the Galaxy Tab A. The update is pushing out in France to the 9.7-inch Wi-Fi only variant. It’s also pushing out in Australia to the 8-inch Wi-Fi model. The update is a little over 1GB in size and it brings enhancements and new features to the slate. Look for both versions of the Galaxy Tab A Android Marshmallow update to pick up the pace in the weeks ahead. U.S. Cellular’s also started rolling out the Samsung Galaxy S 10.5 Android Marshmallow update after a long wait. Samsung Galaxy S7 Marshmallow Update As expected, the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge both run the company’s Android 6.0.1 software. The two devices run a unique version of the operating system. You can get a feel for their version of Marshmallow software in the hands-on video above. It’s worth noting that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge do not support Android 6.0’s Adoptable Storage feature, a concern given the fact that it only comes with 32GB of internal storage space in the United States. It’s also worth noting that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge come with some additional emoji characters. A full outline of those characters can be found right here. In 2016, Samsung rolled out an “urgent” software update for the Galaxy S7 Edge. T-Mobile also pushed out bug fix updates to the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. More recently, Samsung and its carrier partners have been rolling out updates with a Wi-Fi Calling update on board. The update’s landed for the AT&T Galaxy S7 and AT&T Galaxy S7 Edge and it checks in at 600MB in size making it a substantial release for the two flagship devices. Rogers in Canada has put out the same update for its Galaxy S7 models. It’s also important to know that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates are now available online. These will be useful if you need to go back to stock software at any point during your time with the Galaxy S7. Samsung January Security Update Google is rolling out January security updates to its Nexus devices and Samsung is following suit with January security updates of its own. The January patch is rolling out slowly though it’s now available for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 in Germany and the Galaxy S6 Edge+ in Europe. It’s also rolling out on select carriers in the United States. Verizon recently pushed out the January security update to its Galaxy S6 variants and the Galaxy Note 5. As for the contents of the January patch, Samsung’s latest security update comes with several important patches and you can read the specific patch notes on the company’s website. Android Nougat As we’ve noted, the Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow roll out has been joined by Samsung’s new Android 7.0 Nougat update. The company’s official Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat roll outs have begun though the release is limited to select models in select regions around the world. We expect that to change soon. Samsung’s promised several Nougat updates in the first half of 2017 and we expect all of these upgrades to deliver new features, tweaks and fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android Nougat walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0. It’s not clear when or if Samsung will bump its devices to Android 7.1.1, the most up-t0-date version of Nougat. 10 Things to Do Before Installing Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow Get Familiar with Android 6.0.1 & Marshmallow   1 / 10 Let's start with something very important.  One of the first things you'll want to do is get familiar with the changes coming with your version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Each update is going to be a little bit different (carriers can't help themselves) but there some core elements to each.  There are a number of resources around the web but we'll provide you with some great starting points right here.  We've taken a deep dive into the differences between Lollipop and Marshmallow and you'll want to check the basics out so that you're comfortable with the changes.  Android 6.0.1, the version of Marshmallow rolling out to Galaxy devices, is a little different than Android 6.0. You can get familiar with some of Android 6.0.1's basics right here. And then we get to the device level. That is to say that the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow update is a little different than the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. We've outlined some of those differences and you can find them at the links provided.  Things will be different at the carrier level as well and you'll want to look into those changes as well. Unfortunately, those changes will arrive whenever Samsung and your carrier decide to push out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for your device. We'll provide you with the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow release notes as an example.  If you haven't been following along, now is a great time to look into the new features and enhancements so that you're as proficient as possible after you download and install Marshmallow on your Galaxy phone or tablet.    1 / 10 356 Responses 01/06/2016 Ben Reply i dont see any difference in this version and what I am currently running on my S^ which I just got a few days ago. The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 01/26/2016 Emma William Reply Samsung starts rolling out January security update for its flagship smartphones including Galaxy S5 04/03/2016 Elijah Abeyta Reply You’re mistaken. This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

If it’s not resolved within the two year update I’m moving to iOS. I rather deal with a company that updates regular and is more restrictive about what you can have than a company that takes months and months to update their devices. 01/11/2016 Taha Reply Chuck. Buying a nexus gives you instant apple style hardware and software updates. Cheers 01/12/2016 mnet Reply I agree with you to a point. But you have to ask yourself are you looking for updates for the sake of just getting something “new”? Most updates are minor, granted 6.0 is no minor update.

I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Had the S3, Note 10.1 (2012) and now Note 4 and always the same with lack of updates or extremely slow to update. Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it. Give us the choice FFS! F U SAMDUNG! 02/25/2016 Too Squat Reply Note 4 owner…I think this is my last Samsung. I bought it because of the pen. Used to be an HTC buyer, they converted me to Android.

This is like reading the same thing over and over and over again. 4 months into Marshmellow and barely any devices have recieved it. Pathetic. Carriers suck with the added bloatware but it shouldn’t be this damn complicated. The real reason for the wait, S7 and S7 Edge. Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first. Yes, its a business but wow…get the ball rolling Samsung or you’ll be losing about 100 people I know who’d love to try Apple.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

Like, now I cannot define the pattern of vibration when a phone rings. Bummer. I liked that. Second, while waking up the phone, the screen-light come on really slowly. Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment. There are many more, though. Disappointing, Samsung.

It may be in settings or you may have to enter device recovery by turning it off then holding either the up or down volume while also holding power while it starts. Google search for your correct way of entering recovery. Then when you do get there, use volume keys as directionals to select clearing system cache. OK that by the power key. Then select reboot and OK it by the power key.

The amount of people threatening to switch from one brand to another and crying because they don’t have the update yet is shocking. Children….you will have your Marshmellow after you eat all your lollipop. Relax. Wait. There is nothing wrong with your lollipop. Wha wha why do I have to wait…Johnny has marshmellow….holy crap shut up you whiny little b$/!@. seriously. 03/28/2016 Dan Reply You didn’t need to post if you already have it. If you don’t have it and don’t care, you still didn’t need to post. Let us rant and why don’t you stay quiet? Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago. It’s working flawlessly and full of all the promised upgrades and features. 03/24/2016 Preston Reply Note 5 on Sprint is getting it now. 03/24/2016 Jack Reply Receiving marshmallow from Sprint on my s6 edge+ now! 03/24/2016 Charles Reply About the only thing you can say about the Big Marshmallow Roll Out – is that it’s worth every penny ya paid for it. From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit…. Marshmallow is worth every penny ya paid for it. 03/24/2016 Jeffrey Gohlke Reply US Cellular S6 updated to 6.0.1 today 3-24-16 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply 203=1m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

If Wi-Fi is switched on, only the Play Store does not work. The Play Store works fine on LTE. All other Wi-Fi functions work fine. So I reset my device twice but no improvement.

What is the hold up, samsung??!?!?! Get on the ball, or hire some competent developers to get that update to everyone. This is ridiculous! 03/28/2016 Stan Reply I don’t think it’s too much too ask that Verizon, who are a multi-billion dollar empire, who rushed to be the first US player to update marshallow to Samsung’s phones ensure a safe install. The update BRICKED MY PHONE by not allowing it to charge. Even using a new battery didn’t work! I Have safely updated many phones and computers a million different ways. NEVER have I ever had an update DESTROY A device, let alone an $800 phone! The super messed up part is the take NO accountability for releasing software that can damage your phone. Why do you think people are migrating in DROVES to T Mobil? Me being one…**** Verizon and hope they choke the thousands of dollars I’ve thrown their Way!

Or clear all cache and reboot. 03/29/2016 Marcus Reply I just recently updated my Sprint Galaxy Note 4 to android marshmallow 6.0.1, I also have updated another phone on my account to the Galaxy S7 edge the S7 running 6.9.1 is good so far as expected. However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back. Leaving out a major update at this stage of the game makes no sense at all. Guy’s get it fixed and get it right. 03/30/2016 Jay Reply Just got the 6.0.1 on my notes 5 sm – n920g 03/30/2016 Pamela Huff Reply My us cellular s6 edge plus updated to marshmallow a couple of weeks ago and I love it. Definitely some edge screen improvements but by far the most useful is having Google now right on top, no matter what page you’re on. 03/30/2016 Charles Reply As roll outs go… this is like standing in the middle of a turtle stampede. Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail.

Too many issues to mention here. My phone is messed up! 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Here we are at the close of yet another month… March 31 – with Marshmallow market share resting comfortably at 2.3%… The pundits milestones fall by the wayside once again. and, They refuse to hold silence on their accolades for 6.0.1 – that barely exists… – and, where it does exist – there is no small amount of nashing of teeth. The pundits sell great snake oil…. btw… And, what’s wrong with snake oil – you might say. When was the last time you saw a squeaky snake? oh… well… There is always April – then May – then June…. Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone.

My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card.

Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache. Afterwards in either, do a reboot if possible. 04/09/2016 Landon R Caviness Reply Come on AT&T… By far the slowest carrier for updates… 04/10/2016 Ehsan Reply I am overall pleased with the marshmallow update in note 5 features are great interface just goto better, the only thing annoying to me is the grey strip on the top notification panel where battery indicator time etc are located.

Before, switching back and forth between fingerprint and nothing was super easy. Use fingerprints to identify, choose none, that’s it. Now it is fricken ridiculous and annoying as hell cause it asks for your backup password or code, then you select none, then it ALWAYS says cancel/delete fingerprints/keep fingerprints, even if you select keep fingerprints it asks for you to create a backup passcode TWICE which you already have!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Size: 1474.19 MB Version: N915PVPU4DPD1/N915PSPT4DPD1/N915PVPU4DPD1 · OS upgrade – Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow · To get the best from your device, please keep your phone up to date and regularly check for software updates. ※ Fingerprints are securely protected. An alternative unlock method (pattern, PIN, or password) is required to add fingerprints. ※ Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow does not support the Decrypt device function. If your mobile device is encrypted, encryption cannot be disabled after upgrading. If you want encryption to be disabled after upgrading, it must be disabled before you upgrade your device. To disable encryption go to Settings – Lock screen and security – Other security settings, then select Decrypt device. ※ If the Samsung Gear or Gear Fit Manager app does not work normally after this upgrade, uninstall the app, then install the latest version. This will reset your Gear to factory default settings and all data on your Gear will be erased. ※ Some apps that were installed via the Lollipop OS may need to be updated after upgrading to the Marshmallow OS. Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet.

Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box.

I understand all the tweets and wrinkles need to be ironed out but seriously I feel there is something being manipulated behind the AT&T curtain. 05/23/2016 Andy Reply Marshmallow on T-Mobile Galaxy S5 is downloading right now on my device! Stills says “T-Mobile Testing” on T-Mobile website though…so, probably a phased roll out. 05/23/2016 Charles Reply I would have preferred to have gone with Marshmallow in the Tab s2 first… The Galaxy s6 edge plus… is no big deal… At least, it didn’t go completely psychotic. The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last…. Sooner or later 5G will drop… = new hardware, new chargers and new cables… the OS will be gawd knows what by then. Enjoy it while it lasts. 05/26/2016 Jens Reply Woke up this morning to a 1500 plus mb download yay think I finally got the note 4 update from bell in Canada Hope it’s not just a security update. 05/26/2016 Steve Reply Got an update on Galaxy S6 last night. It updated fine and seemed to work ok. However, it appears to have disabled the ability to charge. By morning the plugged in phone had dropped to 0%. When unplugged it crashed and will no longer charge or boot. Told by Sprint tech they would have to factory reset. Sprint obviously doesn’t do any testing on their OTA software updates! 05/28/2016 Benjamin Reply I have the Note 4 (Through AT&T) and they have yet to release it on mine.

Samsung Galaxy series with Marshmalow OS are always my first choice in the current market. The features in its new updates are even more attractive than ever. Thanls for the info. 06/16/2016 Patrick Reply Yes AT&T sucks in many was, but as far as the Marshmallow update goes, Samsung has not released Marshmallow for some U.S models. I was anticipating my phone to update in June, but AT&T claims they have not received some Marshmallow updates from Samsung. June is not over, but AT&T will probably take their sweet time sending to phones under their umbrella. 06/16/2016 Alan Reply Samsung s stinks as does att. Note 5 June 16th still no update. I’m thinking about going back to Apple after a decade of this crap 06/19/2016 Phienyx Reply Have they fixed the feature where the LED blinks for unviewed notifications yet? … or is this still not been acknowledged or addressed? 06/23/2016 AJ Reply Samsung as a company should be so ashamed of how they manage all their device updates.. It is clear from that the postings on this article and hundreds like it that they are losing millions of phone sales to apple because of this reason alone. Make less models but keep them updated for min 5 years and you will have loyal supporters not careful ones.

Why not AT&T? What are AT&T’s plans for rolling out Marshmallow on their Note Edge models (SM-N915A)? 07/09/2016 Jonathan Reply Got the update on my WiFi only Tab S2 and it’s nothing but problems. One user is completely locked out because the fingerprint scanner won’t work and it will not recognize the backup password. The primary user keeps getting an “update security policy/set up fingerprint security” bullshit popup every single time the damn thing is unlocked, so have had to disable security on that user account. On top of that the tablet is often running a lot slower. So far I don’t see any benefits. 07/14/2016 strauss44 Reply Received my Android 6.0.1 today in Canada, via broadband cable from Shaw cable, then by inhouse WiFi to my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. It installed without incident and all apps appear to work fine. Only about six Apps needed updating, and did so on next rebot. All I can tell is essentially cosmetic changes. It does appear that browsers Opera and Firefox run slightly faster.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone. Otherwise I have no choice but to revive my old Galaxy 4. Kinda sux after paying it off over 12 months. 08/12/2016 Shereen Reply I did my update on Galaxy A5 and love the look.

Not sure what went wrong. I also noticed that when I go into my gallery it hangs before showing me the folders so I can view my photos. 08/13/2016 Mrticklesz Reply Its because they’re trying to sell their new products which is no any different than the note 4.. damn you samsung! 08/14/2016 Dee Reply Still no marshmallow for Galaxy Alpha… 08/18/2016 Dwan Sadler Reply Why didn’t the Sprin’ts Marshmallow update come with video calling? ATT, Verizon, and T-Mobile all have Samsung video calling S M H 08/23/2016 fux Reply Galaxy Alpha – waiting is the hardest time! 08/23/2016 Charles Reply ??? Lollipop worked ??? Marshmallow worked. The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now.

That YouTube Go app is now live in India and is already available for download on Google Play Store. However, the app is still in beta and is only available for download as a part of Google's early access programme.    The app will let you download or play most of the YouTube videos to your device but only in ‘Basic’ and ‘Standard’ quality. Also, a lot of features from the native YouTube app are missing such as the ability to swipe down the currently playing video and browse other content at the same time. However, the new YouTube Go app lets you preview videos before you download it.   Opening up the app, you will be asked to choose your preferred language among tonnes of Indian regional languages. Post that, you will be asked to enter your mobile number for one-time verification after which you will be also asked to log in or choose your current synced Google accounts. The mobile number verification also simplifies the whole process of sharing your videos with your friends later on.   Once you reach the home tab, you can browse through recommended videos or search for a specific YouTube video you want to download. On tapping a particular video, the app will automatically start displaying the preview and will ask you to either play or download the video. Apart from showing two options for video quality i.e. Basic and Standard, the app also displays the amount of memory it will take on your device.   Once downloaded, you can then navigate to the ‘Saved’ tab placed on the right where you can send and receive videos from your friends via Bluetooth.   While the app does miss out some features including different tabs for Trending, Subscriptions and Recommended, it can be hit amongst the people it is targeted to.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Want to Wear Your Data? Google and H&M Bring Couture into the Digital Age with “Data Dress” By Zara Ali Feb 6, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Just when you think that technology has already reached its pinnacle for helping us in making smallest of decisions, here comes another surprise. Google and the famous fashion brand – H&M – have come together for a new app dubbed as Data Dress. The idea of the app is to help you with custom clothing by analysing your lifestyle, activities, hangouts, and the weather. It examines your routine and surroundings around you or what gathering you’re going to attend and based on such aspects, it suggests a custom dress. At the Google Developer I/O conference last year, the tech giant unveiled an Awareness API, which utilizes all the sensors available on your device to get every possible information. At that time, Google did not reveal much about what’s coming in the future. With the advent of this new app in collaboration with H&M’s digital fashion house Ivyrevel – we can see how things are panning out. In its blog, Google says: Advertisement We have already seen some great implementations of the API in obvious scenarios, such as shopping for a new home in the neighborhood or recommending a music playlist while starting a jog. For New York Fashion Week, we explored other creative integrations of the Awareness API and collaborated with H&M Group’s digital fashion house Ivyrevel and its Fashion Tech Lab to bring couture into the digital age with the ‘Data Dress,’ a personalized dress designed entirely based on a user’s context signals. It is not yet clear how the app works and how does it analyse the available user data. However, based on the images, we could expect that the custom dress will be designed as per the theme and type (formal or social) of the occasion. Also, it will be according to the weather. For example – if you’re in Miami then the dress will be made from the fabric that is suitable for summery appearance. Google Kills 'Hands Free' Payment App to Focus on Android Pay By making use of all the sensors available on your device, the app will detect the surrounding and your activity. It will know if you’re driving or cycling or maybe just out for a walk. It will make use of GPS and detect your location and will present to you a dress that will be according to the place, occasion, trend, and comfort. It does intrude into your privacy by collecting every data about your lifestyle, but hey, you have to compromise on privacy if you want a custom dress designed with the expertise of H&M. For now, the app is in its closed alpha stage, but Google will soon be launching its beta version by the end of this year. Regarding the pricing of dresses that will be available on the app, Ivyrevel says that the starting price for a dress would be somewhere around $99. It would be pretty exciting to see how the app works and how many users would be willing to give it a try. Curious ones can also sign-up for the beta trial before the app goes official. In the meantime, we would like to know if you would give “Data Dress” a try whenever it goes official? Share your views through the comment section below.

Android Wear 2.0 lands on two new LG smartwatches, Adidas has beef with Tesla, and the next iPhone could be expensive. I mean, more expensive. Faster and easier to use.Android Wear 2.0 was worth the long wait Google's wearable update is the platform's biggest one since the birth of Android Wear, three years ago. "With 2.0, we really looked hard at what people are using their watches for," said Android Wear VP David Singleton. "We saw that usage was really focused around watch faces, messaging and fitness. So we really optimized 2.0 for those things." But Google improved a lot of other aspects of Wear as well, including the user interface, navigation and notifications. We took a closer look. Stripes and gripes.Adidas thinks Tesla's old Model 3 logo is a little too familiar Would you confuse the Tesla Model 3's three-bar logo with Adidas' signature stripes? No? Did you know that was the upcoming Tesla's logo? Maybe not. But don't tell that to Adidas. The apparel giant has filed a challenge to prevent Tesla from registering the Model 3's logo as a trademark. It's similar enough to Adidas' stripes that it's "likely to cause confusion" and suggest the two brands are connected, according to the filing. That said, the EV maker quietly changed the logo to the numeric "3" weeks ago, well before Adidas filed its notice. You could be an NBA playerNBA and 2K team up for the first eSports league owned by a US pro league Next year, you could realistically expect to become an NBA draft pick. We weren't expecting that either, but it's a possibility because the NBA and Take Two have teamed up to create the NBA 2K eLeague. It will launch with 8 - 12 teams that are all owned by existing NBA franchises, and recruit online players to go 5-on-5 in the NBA 2K video game. NBA commish Adam Silver says there will be broadcasts via internet and TV, as it seeks to attract people who otherwise might not think they could ever play in the league. iPhone XSpecial edition 'anniversary' iPhone could be pricey Since this year will be the tenth anniversary for Apple's iPhone, people are expecting something special. The latest rumor from Fast Company indicates that while an incrementally upgraded iPhone 7s is on the way in 4.7- and 5.5-inch sizes, there will also be an iPhone 8 with all new features like an OLED screen, no physical home button and maybe even 3D-sensing technology. All of those parts come at a cost, however, and its price (unlocked) could start above $1,000. The latest ultrathin "metalenses" can now handle multiple colors.Lenses made from nanomaterials get closer to replacing glass Researchers recently showed off breakthrough nanomaterial "metalenses" that could replace bulky glass optics. Unfortunately, these only worked on a single color at a time, meaning your hypothetical smartphone camera of the future would only be able to do arty, monochromatic photos. However, the same team at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), has now unveiled a new material that works on a spectrum of colors from blue to green -- making it a more realistic proposition for substituting in for lenses and other optical tech. The material is lighter and thinner than glass, meaning that metalenses could change cameras, smartphones and even our own specs in the future. Sporty swipesReview: LG Watch Sport with Android Wear 2.0 LG's Watch Sport is the more impressive of the two smartwatches launching with Android Wear 2.0, and for the most part it's a very respectable showing. Beyond the seriously snappy performance, the big Android Wear update brings a load of design tweaks and new features that the platform has needed for a long time. It's not perfect, but the software helps soften some of the watch's shortcomings: the body will be still too chunky for some, and we wish the battery lasted much longer (Not so) Posh swipes Review: LG Watch Style with Android Wear 2.0 The LG Watch Style is sadly underwhelming in comparison to the pricier Sport. Despite its name, the Style has a bland design and only meets Android Wear 2.0's minimum hardware requirements. On the bright side, Google's new operating system is faster and more intuitive than before. Too bad the Style isn't a great vehicle for showcasing said new software. It's putting all the pieces togetherCorsair teases its first whole computer You probably know Corsair as a computer parts and peripherals manufacturer. It makes all those DRAM modules, flash drives, PC cases, SSDs, keyboards, mice and the rest. Now it's trying to put it all together. An ad published in Maximum PC's March issue, revealed that the company has become a full-fledged PC maker. Its first ever whole computer is fittingly called Corsair One. Pink because love.Pink creatures will invade 'Pokémon Go' this Valentine season Pokémon Go's latest seasonal promotion is all about Clefairies, Jigglypuffs and other pink-hued monsters. Like prior promotions, you'll also bag double the amount of candy when you catch, hatch or transfer a Pokémon to the Professor. Oh, and you may want to hold onto those lures until the event begins -- each one will keep attracting Pokémon for six hours instead of the usual 30 minutes.

The US tech firms new R&D facility, the first of its kind for the company in Ireland, will be the first IDA supported operation to come to the area in over 30 years and already interest is buzzing about roles on offer at the Stereame site. At a recruitment drive held for LIT Thurles and Clonmel students, members of First Data's senior staff and HR team provided information for student internships, graduate programmes and work placements, saying they were eager to create links with the college. Additionally students were also told of the office blocks silicon valley inspired design with plans to include “moveable walls, nap pods and Bean Bags” replicating Google's unique office environment. The payments processing company, which works with the likes of Amazon and Stripe, is set to provide over 300 jobs at the Nenagh R&D facility with up to 50 employed at the centre by year end. The company say they will then carry out a “phased employment” system and expect to have an additional 250 working at the Stereame site by 2018. The centre was originally scheduled to open its doors this summer however due to construction delays it is now expected that the facility will be up and running by the end of the year. Among the jobs on offer will be roles in application/ software development, application analysis, business analysis, technical project management, systems consulting, and enterprise architecture. All roles will be advertised on the First Data website (www.firstdata.com) as well as Irishjobs.ie with roles expected to come on stream in the next six to eight weeks. A recruitment office for the company in the town is also in the pipeline for the coming weeks. However speaking at the recruitment drive at the Thurles campus VP and general manager of eCommerce EMEA at First Data Peter O'Halloran said the company will be looking at applicants as a whole, adding that a strong Linkden presence and good social media portfolio is seen as highly beneficial. “Be well prepared when coming for an interview. If you say you have an interest in cyber security be able to talk about it. Do your research on the company. Skill sets speak for themselves and all staff are given the opportunity to up skill but you need to be prepared and have your research done,” he added.   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition Death Shock as popular Thurles lady dies Dermot Ryan Appointment Top Amnesty role in Australia for Nenagh man Nenagh Court Off-duty Garda found guilty of assaulting two women Tipperary deaths - Friday 10 February, 2017 Tommy Lyons pictured with his son Brian, a former captain of the Thurles Rugby team.

Google’s Android Wear distribution for smartwatches and wearables has cumulatively held its own against the Apple Watch, but considering the sorry state of the smartwatch market in general, that’s not saying much. Google is giving it at least one more shot, however, with the release of Android Wear 2.0. Android Wear 2.0 on LG Watch Style (first three on left) and LG Watch Sport (click image to enlarge) Many of Android Wear 2.0’s new features have already appeared on the Apple Watch Series 2 with watchOS 3, as well as Samsung’s Tizen Linux-based, dual Cortex-A53 Samsung Gear 3. Some have even appeared on select Android Wear watches. But there are a few new tricks here as well, along with a greatly improved interface. In any case, it’s all built in, making it easier for those vendors brave enough to continue in the smartwatch market to reach market more quickly. LG collaborated with Google to be the first out of the gate with the $249 LG Watch Style and $349 LG Watch Sport (see farther below). Many other recent Android Wear watches will also be getting the upgrade in the coming weeks and months, including some earlier LG Watch models, as detailed in this December story from The Verge. There’s no single leading feature in Android Wear 2.0, but Google’s announcement highlights the new interface with its redesigned watchfaces and watchface personalization features. You can swipe to switch between watchfaces for work, gym, home, social functions, and more. In addition to some hands-on user customization, you can load third-party apps to run in watchfaces that for the first time include watchface complications: details beyond time, such as a battery indicator. Two new Android Wear 2.0 watch faces, including one on the Rose Gold version of the LG Watch Style (click images to enlarge) There are now more single-tap functions. “When you receive a message, you can expand the notification and tap to respond by dictating, typing or handwriting your answer, or drawing an emoji,” says Google. A Feb. 8 review of the new LG watches from The Verge praised the new UI. The interface is “simpler and more obvious to use, with less reliance on hard-to-find gestures,” said the story. Among other enhancements, a Smart Reply feature “intelligently suggests different responses based on the message you received.” That may sound a little creepy until you read through your texts and realize just how predictable and repeatable most of them are. And it’s definitely harder to enter data on a watch. Google Fit (left) and Google Assistant Android Wear 2.0 interfaces (click images to enlarge) Speaking of creepy things that can actually save you time, the new release now offers Google Assistant built in. The Alexa- and Siri-like voice interface, which is built into the Amazon Echo like Google Home, and which may be heading for the Raspberry Pi, is initially available in English and German, with more languages coming. Google has updated the Google Fit app to let you track your pace, distance, calories burned, and heart rate. You can also track weight-lifting reps, push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. Android Wear 2.0 watches can now be fully autonomous, including LTE voice telephony, assuming your watch supports it. However, some functions are enhanced when a smartphone is tethered. When Google Fit is dominating local operations, for example, a tethered phone lets you continue to call, check messages, use apps, or stream music from Google Play Music. In addition to customizing watchfaces, you can now choose which apps you want, and download them directly onto the watch from Google Play Store. This improves upon the clumsy old app installation and management system, which required a tethered phone iPhone support now appears to have drawn even with Android. Even if you have both an iPhone and an Android Wear watch — which is unlikely — you can locally run apps including AccuWeather, Android Pay, Bring!, Foursquare, Google Fit, Google Messenger, Google Play Music, Lifesum, Robinhood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Telegram, and Uber. There’s also built-in Android Pay support, which requires an NFC chip. If you typically shop at retailers with Google’s payment scheme, then you may agree with The Verge when it says: “Android Pay might be the best reason to buy an Android Wear watch this year.” On the other hand, The Verge dinged Android Wear 2.0 for “being buggier than it should be, especially given the fact that it had an extended public beta period and its launch was delayed by months.” Google Assistant was said to be particularly error prone.   LG Watch Style and Sport Neither of the first two Android Wear 2.0 watches are luxury watches, but neither represents a price breakthrough, either. The more rugged, $349 LG Watch Sport supports all of the new 2.0 features, while the $249 Watch Style is more limited. LG Watch Style (left) and LG Watch Sport, both with titanium styling (click images to enlarge) Both watches feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 SoC, which first appeared last year on the Android 1.4-ready Casio Mission. The 1.2GHz, quad-core Cortex-A7 SoC is joined by 768MB LPDDR3 on the Sport and 512MB on the Style, as well as 4GB eMMC. The Sport features a 480 x 480-pixel 1.38-inch display, while the Style has a 1.2-inch 360 x 360 display. Both are round, P-OLED touchscreens. Common features include WiFi-n and Bluetooth 4.2 LE, while the Sport adds LTE, NFC, GPS, and heart sensors. The watches provide a “rotating power button that lets you easily scroll through your stream, bring up the app launcher, or get help from your Google Assistant,” says Google. This newly supported feature, similar to the Apple Watch bezel, is joined on the Sport by two customizable quick-launch buttons that by default load Google Fit and Android Pay. There’s a 430mAh battery on the LG Watch Sport and a 24mAh on the LG Watch Style, and they offer IP68 and IP67 protection, respectively. The Style is thinner, at 10.8mm, compared to 14.8mm on the Sport. The Style is available in silver, rose gold, and titanium finishes while the Sport offers titanium or dark blue. They both support Android Wear swappable straps. The two watches, and especially the Sport, have already received some enthusiastic reviews. In the case of a positive Engadget review of the Sport, which praises the watch for its speed and features, but dings it for a “lackluster battery and a thick body,” the best feature is Android Wear 2.0 itself.   Further information Android Wear 2.0 is available now. More information may be found at Google’s Android Wear 2.0 announcement and Android Wear product page. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style will be available Feb. 10 on Google Play, starting at $349 and $249, respectively. Verizon has posted a page for the Sport selling it for $330 on a two-year LTE contract or for $380 on its own, and AT&T has a coming soon page for the Sport. BestBuy has the Style for $250 in titanium or silver, or $279 in rose gold.   Related posts: Android Wear adds WiFi support, always-on apps, emojis Android Wear and Tizen smartwatches light up IFA Samsung rolls out a round, Tizen-based Gear S2 watch WebOS pops up in LG SmartWatch leak MIPS-based Android Wear watch pulled from Indiegogo Linux smartwatch offers luxury stylings and a novel… Android Wear watches go chrono-a-chrono with Apple Watch Samsung's 14nm wearable SoC debuts on Gear 3 watch Modular smartwatch runs Tizen on Edison Tizen-based Samsung cameras and round smartwatch leaked (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

The six Android Wear 2.0 changes you should check out first Android Wear 2.0 is a big improvement. Here are the things you'll want to do first to get acclimated. Michael Simon on 09 February, 2017 06:55 0 - - - - print email In case you haven’t heard, Android Wear 2.0 is here. Well, almost here. The first two watches to run it will be released on February 10, and within weeks, a whole assortment of new and old watches will be able to take advantage of the new features, which are nearly nine months in the making. But while the new version of Android Wear isn’t all that different from the version that was previewed at Google I/O last May, it is a pretty major upgrade to the long-in-the-tooth wearable OS on current watches. It’s not a complete overhaul of Google’s original concept, but it adds and changes enough things to make the overall experience feel fresh and new, and whether you have an old watch or plan on buying one of the new ones, you’ll be able to dive right in without needing to learn a whole new set of instructions. Here are some of the highlights of the new Android Wear overhaul you should check out first. Google It’s easier to navigate menus and change watch faces in Android Wear 2.0. Learn the layout The first version of Android Wear wasn’t exactly complicated, but it also wasn’t as intuitive as it could be. With the second release, Google has simplified things all throughout the system, from the way we change watch faces to how we access notifications. There’s a new circular interface for selecting apps, direct access to Google Assistant via the power button, and, with the new LG-Google watches, easier scrolling and selecting with the rotating crown. Everything is friendlier and simpler, and this time around, your first instinct is probably the right one. Greenbot With a Play Store right on your watch, Android Wear 2.0 makes it easy to discover new apps. Check out the Play Store Apps on our watches aren’t as necessary as they are on our phone, but it’s still fun to check out what’s new in the Play Store. With Wear 2.0, you won’t even need a phone to do it. Head into the app screen and you’ll find a new Play Store icon, which will let you explore and install apps just like you would on your phone. It’s fast and convenient, and it also means you won’t need to clutter your phone up with a bunch of apps you might not need. And now, even iPhone users can get in on the fun. Only a handful are available at launch—among Google’s own offerings, AccuWeather, Foursquare, Telegram, and Uber—but many more will surely be landing soon. In previous versions of Android Wear, you had to load an app on your phone, which would push the watch component over. Now, watch apps stand alone, which means you can have an app on your watch without a corresponding app on your phone at all. Google Google Fit does more to keep you healthy in Android Wear 2.0. Start a workout Google Fit has always been a fine workout companion in Android Wear, but in version 2.0 it’s become a full-fledged personal trainer. In addition to step counting and bicycle riding, the new app tracks a ton of extra activities, including pace, distance, and calories burned, in addition to measuring weight-lifting reps, push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. Some features will require new watches with new sensors, but even for older watches, Google Fit should be able to do more to keep you in shape. Google With Google Assistant on your Android Wear watch, the world is at your fingertips. Ask a question Previous Android Watches could execute a set of voice-controlled actions and answers, but with Android Wear 2.0, Google has built Google Assistant right into your wrist. Available via “OK Google” or by long-pressing your watch’s power button, Google Assistant opens up Android Wear to a whole new world of hands-free information. Google provides a few examples to get you started: “Ask your Google Assistant about the weather or remind yourself to bring an umbrella. Make a restaurant reservation or navigate to work. You can even update your shopping list right from your wrist.” But as Google Assistant matures and integrates with more apps, the possibilities are endless. Google Responding to messges on your wrist is easier than ever with Android Wear 2.0. Write a message One of the best features of wearing a smartwatch is being able to get notifications on our wrists, but responding to them has always been an issue. With Android Wear 2.0, Google has made it easier to interact with notifications as they arrive, letting you write and return messages just by tapping an incoming alert. And with dictation and handwriting support, and even a new on-screen keyboard, you can draw letters and even emoji to create quick replies. You’re probably not going to want to use it to write anything more than a few words at a time, but you won’t need to pull out your phone anymore just to tell your friend that you’re on the way. Google You can buy stuff with Android Pay and Android Wear 2.0, but you’ll need a new watch. Buy something One of the coolest features of Android Wear 2.0 is support for Android Pay, provided your watch has a built-in NFC chip. And most don’t—including the smaller LG Style watch that is just going on sale. But it’s sure to be a feature that makes its way into most future releases. All you need to do to pay with your watch is verify your cards in the Android Pay app, press the side button to bring up your available cards (or open the app), select the one you want to pay with, and hold your watch next to the payment reader. And your wallet won’t even know what happened. We’re Hooked on Our Devices, But Can We Handle the Eye Strain? More from Essilor Australia Join the PC World newsletter!

TECHNOLOGY Fake Amazon Ad Shows Why You Should Use Caution When Clicking Ads in Google Search Results Clicking the ad led users to a fake computer service alert. By Minda Zetlin Minda Zetlin is a business technology writer and speaker, co-author of The Geek Gap, and former president of the American Society of Journalists and Authors. Sign up here for a once-a-week email and you'll never miss her columns. @MindaZetlin Co-author, 'The Geek Gap'@MindaZetlin WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Ever search on Google? If you do you've often seen how ads can ads can show up at the very top of the results, clearly marked with a tiny green square that says "Ad" on it. On Wednesday, when users searched "Amazon" (which happens to be the most-searched retailer on Google), something that looked like an ad for Amazon appeared at the top of the list. But, as ZDNet's Zack Whittaker discovered, it was a fake. If you clicked on the ad, rather than taking you to Amazon, it would take you to an "alert" page that says there is something very wrong with your operating system. The ad would detect whether your computer was a PC or a Mac and provide either a scary Windows alert or a scary Mac alert as appropriate. In some cases, if you then tried to close the page, it would freeze your browser, and possibly your computer. The good news is that, as fake ads go, this one seems to have been relatively benign. Rather than infect your computer with malware (as some fake ads do if you click on them) this one simply tried to compel users to call a supposed Microsoft or Apple number for support. Even if you clicked on the ad, if you didn't call that number, you're probably safe. The bad news is that this ad got through Google's ad-verifying security systems, even though they were smart enough to stop 1.7 billion bad ads last year, according to Google's blog. Of course, some of those ads were simply for products Google doesn't accept ads for, such as payday loans and illegal gambling, but the company says it took down 900,000 ads that led to sites containing malware as well. The algorithms that bring a website that isn't an ad to the top of your Google search results are complex, and the company does not divulge their full details. But one element that drives high search ranking is inbound links from other sites, making it unlikely that a scam website could be ranked among your non-ad top search results. Ads are different, though, since advertisers pay for search ranking and can sometimes buy their way to the top. Obviously, if the company pulled down 1.7 billion bad ads, Google is pretty good at finding these. But as these events illustrate, once in a while something bad can slip through. Common sense suggests a few simple precautions: 1. If you have the choice between a non-ad and an ad, pick the non-ad site. Let's say you search "Macy's" and both an ad for Macy's and a Macy's website that isn't an ad show up at the top of your results. Clicking the non-ad Macy's is likelier to get you the store's home page, assuming that's what you want. This is particularly important if you're planning to download software from a site you're searching. One time I made the mistake of clicking on an ad, trying to download a browser, and the website I went to (which looked like a legit company website) attempted to sneak several types of unwanted software onto my computer, along with the browser I was looking for. 2. Float your cursor over a link before you click. In most major browsers, if you place your cursor on a link but don't click it, a preview of the URL will appear somewhere at the bottom of the browser window. Using this technique will often allow you to see what web page you'll actually be sent to if you click. This isn't a foolproof check, though. The creators of the fake Amazon ad apparently managed to make the destination look like a real Amazon page. 3. Read the page description attentively. Google search results come with a bit of text about each page, put there by whoever created it. Before you click on an ad, make sure to read that description. It may not alert you if there's a problem, but then again it could. For reasons known only to them, online scammers are notoriously bad spellers and apparently never bother to use spell check, so there's a decent chance that a spelling or grammatical error might show up in the description of a fake ad. In this case, there were no such errors, but the ad said Amazon was "100% safe" and I have never seen the company describe itself that way in any of its real ads. The fake Amazon ad on Google has been taken down, and Google told ZDNet that it does not comment on individual ads. However, the scam website that the ad linked to is still active, which suggests that the scammers may have more fake advertising planned. Or possibly someone else is planning something worse, such as an ad linking to a web page that will infect your computer with malware if you click on it. Either way, it's smart to be careful.

The tech giant now rolls out first ever update to its Android wear OS after an interval of about 3 years. Since its revelation in 2017, the software has not witnessed any major updates till date. Google just revealed Android Wear 2.0 OS update which will allow users to take the advantage of artificial intelligence. According to The Sun, the Android wear 2.0 OS will include Google Assistant, Google's latest artificial intelligence driven agent which can sense the workforce and implement various measures as per the need of any situation. This would surely make things easier for the users of Android wears. The Chief Engineer of Android Wears David Singleton expressed his wide expectations alongside the official release of this supreme update. He also said, “While traditional watches tell the time, Android Wear watches make the most of your time.” As per a report by Tech Crunch, Google has also named the first device lineups which will be getting the update as prior participants. These are the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport. The update is said to be implemented by the upcoming week. However, experts are also expecting now to see the Android Wear 2.0 on other Android OS based wears and gears as well. Some insiders have even regarded this step as an effort by Google to stand tall against its most relevant rival Apple, which has also managed to claim much attention with its Apple Watch. Advertisement The AI-driven Google Assistant and smart replies will enable users of Android Wears to trace their daily activities, to know their total time of being online on daily basis. It is also expected to support them by notifying important news, weather reports, travel updates, traffic conditions while on road and many other sorts of stuff as well.  SEE ALSO Apple May Start Making iPhone 8 Much Before Its Schedule Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X First Ever Snap Leaks; The Phablet To Release Today MWC 2017: Know What To See In This Year's Biggest Smartphone Fair Google Nexus 7 May Turn Out To Be A Potential Rival To Apple iPad Pro 2 New Chrome Extension Gets Free Access To All Hidden Netflix Categories TagsGoogle Assistant, Artificial Intelligence, AI driven Smartwatch, Android Wear 2.0, LG Watch Style Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement © 2015 Latin Post.

Name: Subject: Message: Chrome OS update will fix full-screen issues for Android apps Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 3 413 6 This post was originally published on TabTimes.com. Google announced a few weeks ago that all of the Chromebooks that will be released in 2017 will support running Android apps. However, there are still problems with being able to use those apps in their natural, full-screen mode. Now there’s word that Google is planning to fix those issues in an upcoming update to Chrome OS. Related Articles   Pixel XL is (mostly) back in stock on the Google Store site15 hours ago   The Google Street View leader hits the road to join Lyft&...1 day ago Currently, if a Chromebook starts running an Android app in laptop mode, you can get it to run in its full-screen viewpoint by pressing the F4 key. If you have a 2-in-1 convertible Chromebook, you can’t run Android apps directly from tablet mode; it will still show a top bar. You have to switch to laptop mode, hit the F4 key and then flip the screen around to continue playing in full-screen view while in tablet mode. Obviously, that’s a bit of an annoyance, but there is good news. According to what Kan Liu, the Director of Product Management for Google, told UnboxedChrome, there are changes coming. In the future, Chrome OS will immediately launch Android apps in full-screen mode. It’s not yet clear if this move will be just when a Chromebook is in tablet mode or if it will also be included when it is running in normal laptop mode. It’s currently unknown how Chrome OS will be updated to accommodate full-screen Android apps. It’s also not know when this update will be released. Hopefully, we won’t have to wait too long to play Candy Crush Saga on a 12-inch display. It will also be a benefit for any upcoming tablet-only Chrome OS devices that may launch sometime in the near future. Read: What are the best budget laptops?

The upgrade was announced last year during Google I/O 2016 and the update is a few months late than what was originally planned. The company has not made any revolutionary changes to the smartwatch experience to change how we look at smartwatches. Instead, the company has added updates to many key components of the operating system which will enable faster access to the things that you performed on your Android Wear-powered smartwatch. Image Credit: Google Android Android Wear 1.0 was a bit complicated and most of the operations that you wanted to perform seemed more complex than they should be. Google focused on improving this by removing the complexity. The first important change that you will se is the presence of better Watch Faces and an easier way to change Watch Faces. Image Credit: Google Google has changed the fundamentals of watch faces by adding space to show information from the system as well as third-party apps like Uber, Nike and other fitness or weather apps. This is done by collecting the information using the Complications API. The process to change Watch Faces is as easy as flicking left or right instead of long pressing on the screen to go to a screen where you can change the watch faces. Image Credit: Google Android The second most important improvement is the introduction of standalone apps that don’t need companion apps on your smartphone. You don’t need to install separate apps on your smartphone to help run the Android Wear apps. You can now access Google Play Store on the watch and install new apps without the need of a smartphone. The interface of Android Wear 2.0 is more in line with the Material design guidelines with more emphasis on cards where each notification will get a full screen for its expanded view. Image Credit: Google Another significant improvement is the addition of Android Pay to Android Wear 2.0. You can use your Android Wear 2.0 powered Smart watch to pay using Android Pay. One thing to note is that the smart watch should be equipped with NFC  and your smartphone must have a locked bootloader. Image Credit: Google Google has improved other things like the Google Fit app for Google Android Wear where it now supports more type of workouts and exercises. One interesting thing to note is that Android Wear 2.0 comes with a keyboard to type your responses on. One would obviously not use that keyboard to write long articles or something huge in size. The major thing that makes the keyboard on Android Wear 2.0 significant is that you no longer need to swipe across a Qwerty layout screen to type a message. Instead, the keyboard is powered using the powerful prediction engine of Google Keyboard which works surprisingly well. You can also handwrite messages or use smart reply for Google Assistant. #AndroidWear 2.0: Quickly respond to messages with a new on-watch keyboard, handwriting recognition, or Smart Reply. https://t.co/DOXGYQMtJj pic.twitter.com/UcLikvGr4Q — Android Wear (@AndroidWear) February 8, 2017 Last but not the least, Google has added Google Assistant to Android Wear 2.0 making it a significant improvement over Android Wear 1.0 and Google Now. This is almost like Google Assistant on Google Home or Google Pixel smartphone. One thing to note is that Google has changed its philosophy after realising that one does need some physical input to operate Android Wear, making the presence of buttons and dials mandatory on the new models of watches; a far cry from what it was earlier.

It’s a fast Wi-Fi initiative that aims to bring high-speed internet access to public areas. While India is the lucky country to get the station, the lucky city where the service will first be deployed in Pune. Google Station is a collaborative project between IBM, Larsen and Toubro and RailTel. It’s a Rs 150 crore project that’s won by these companies as part of Pune’s Smart City initiative, reports The Economic Times. Unlike Google’s earlier Railwire project with RailTel, the purpose of Google Station is to provide fast access to the internet in public areas and then eventually monetise the whole system. The smart city council will take a share of this revenue. As with Railwire, Google will primarily provide the platform support required to integrate Wi-Fi access across a multitude of locations with a single sign-on process. Users will simply need to authenticate via OTP. L&T is reportedly the ‘master system integrator’ for the project and will provide much of the infrastructure required. Public call boxes, PA systems, environmental sensors and more will be integrated into the system. ET reports that Google is working with the Pune government for the deployment of variable messaging displays as well. IBM’s solutions will provide the “backbone” for Pune’s Smart City Network, the report adds.
