If, per Waze's motto, the goal is "outsmarting traffic, together," then what better way to do so than by taking cars off the road? A small pilot program in and around Mountain View was first, then last summer Waze, which operates as a unit of Google parent Alphabet, announced its San Francisco launch. As of this week Waze Carpool is now in all nine Bay Area counties and has entered a partnership with Kaiser Permanente, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and Bay Area Toll Authority, and UCSF. That was announced on Facebook yesterday, and Forbes had the inside story. For Waze Carpool, which already operates across Israel, participants provide information like a Facebook or LinkedIn profile and car details to be paired with others who might be headed the same way. Rather than competing with Uber and Lyft on its own turf, Josh Fried, head of business development for Waze, tells Forbes that "We have no intention of going above the 54-cent IRS cap as that brings us into a whole other type of service and we're very committed to keeping this as a not-for-profit, share the expense type of carpool, for regular people going to and from work... There's no way to become a professional Carpool driver -- it's about a ride to work and a ride home." Further, drivers can't make more than two rides per day, so there's no incentive to drive more than you would already plan on. And, as for Waze's cut: "We are not collecting a fee, but eventually we will," Fried says, as is the case in Israel. Major employers like UCSF and Kaiser see the Waze system as in keeping with their own goals, as, predictably, does the MTC. “The transportation option with the greatest available capacity in the Bay Area remains the empty seats in people’s cars,” John Goodwin, a spokesperson for that transit agency, tells the Business Times. “Encouraging carpooling is a heavy lift. We are hopeful that partnerships that involve major employers can make it a little bit lighter.” Taking a casual carpool across the Bay Bridge or with a coworker to the office is one thing, but Waze users picking up the stranger equivalent of hitchhikers seems more unlikely or at least far off.

The company revealed some surprises and important details about its business in a new filing. Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 09 February, 2017 09:32 - - - - print email Comments Snap, the maker of Snapchat, is no longer shrouded in mystery. The company filed its long-awaited S-1 and revealed many unknown details about its financial status. Snap hopes to raise $3 billion next month in an initial public offering that could value the company at $20 billion to $25 billion. The company disclosed an array of achievements, liabilities and enduring challenges. These are the five most surprising and illuminating details Snap shared as it prepares to hit the road during the coming weeks to generate interest from potential investors. 1. Ad revenue is growing rapidly Snap was founded in 2011, but made no attempts to earn revenue until it sold its first ad in late 2014. The company earned $58.7 million in revenue in 2015 and recorded revenue of $404.5 million in 2016. The ramp to revenue has been quick -- it jumped by more than 6 times in 2016 -- and every indication suggests the company will continue growing its ad operations to drive more revenue in the years ahead. [ Related: What Snap can learn from Twitter ahead of its IPO ] 2. Snap is burning through cash Snap has yet to turn a profit and its operational costs, including cost of revenue, have hampered the company’s ability to achieve meaningful progress on that front. The business incurred a net loss of $514.6 million last year and $372.9 million in 2015. In the risk factors section of the S-1, the company wrote: “We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability.” 3. Snap is heavily indebted to Google Cloud Snap has committed to spend at least $2 billion on Google’s cloud infrastructure during the next five years, including a minimum annual payment of $400 million. “We rely on Google Cloud for the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth and other services,” the company wrote in the filing. “Any disruption of or interference with our use of the Google Cloud operation would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business.” The company said there are no alternatives for some of the services provided by Google and transitioning to another cloud provider would be “difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense.” [ Related: Snapchat's Groups let you chat with 16 friends at once ] 4. Rate of user growth declined throughout 2016 Snapchat has an average of 158 million daily active users (DAU) and continues to grow its user base, but the rate of growth dropped significant during the second half of 2016. The app gained 5 million DAUs in the fourth quarter of 2016, down from 10 million in the third quarter and 21 million in the second quarter. “If our [DAUs] growth rate slows, our financial performance will increasingly depend on our ability to elevate user engagement or increase our monetization of users,” the company wrote in the filing. “We anticipate that the growth rate of our user base will decline over time. If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users engage less with Snapchat, our business would be seriously harmed.” 5. User engagement statistics are phenomenal Snapchat borders on addictive behavior for many of its users. Snapchat’s users collectively send 2.5 billion “snaps” per day, more than 60 percent of the app’s DAUs use the chat feature to send snaps and talk with friends and 25 percent of Snap’s DAUs post to their “Story” every day. Users also visit Snapchat an average of 18 times each day, but the level of return engagement fluctuates largely according to the age of each user, according to Snap. Users 25 and older visited Snapchat 12 times and spent 20 minutes on the app every day during the final quarter of 2016. Younger users, however, visited Snapchat more than 20 times and spent more than 30 minutes on Snapchat every day during the same period. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

What we do know is they're reevaluating the whole network here in San Antonio," said Deputy San Antonio City Manager Peter Zanoni at a Jan. 18 council briefing. Listen Listening... / 1:22 Now three weeks later, city staff say, while they have been in touch with Google, there's still no word on how the tech giant will address city and community concerns over the placement of their huts that house the fiber interface equipment. The city halted construction of the remaining 15 Google huts and identified 8 that will need to be relocated, which city staff say could mean a redesign of the fiber network in some areas. City Manager Sheryl Sculley says the city doesn't know how the city's action will impact Google's deployment. "I'm not really sure, I'm unfamiliar with their timeline. They haven't shared that with us yet but I'm optimistic." Councilman Mike Gallagher was optimistic in January after the initial pause, at the time saying he thought it would only be a month or two before things were back on track. Haskin Park, the site of the first Google Fiber Hut and of the first backlash to them, is in his district. Now Councilman Gallagher's optimism has been tempered a bit. "Yeah, I think we need to add another month or two onto that," he says. But--until Google brings an updated plan--no one knows. When contacted by TPR, Google fiber representatives say they have no updates on their timeline. Last week, Google Fiber started taking orders for internet service in Raleigh North Carolina, where it is building in several municipalities in the so-called research triangle. Raleigh -- like San Antonio -- was named a Google fiber expansion city in late 2015.  Tags:  Google Fiber TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. Related Content San Antonio Pushes Pause on Google Fiber Deployment By Paul Flahive • Jan 12, 2017 Google San Antonio pushed pause on Google Fiber construction Wednesday.  In an email between Sheryl Sculley and San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor, the city manager outlined how city staff, council and Google had all agreed on the placement of 17 Google fiber huts. But after completing just two - and receiving neighborhood opposition to their placement - the locations of the remaining 15 are under review and all hut construction has halted. How Will City-Ordered Pause In Construction Impact Google Fiber? By Paul Flahive • Jan 18, 2017 City of San Antonio TCI San Antonio City Council members got a few more details Wednesday about delays in building a Google Fiber network.  The city paused construction after residents complained about the size of the 12-by-30 feet Google “huts,” that house the infrastructure for the project.  Where Will Google Fiber's Backbone Be? Here's A Map. By Paul Flahive • Jan 4, 2017 Google Fiber In November, TPR reported on the future of Google's high-speed Internet network in San Antonio. In an update to the City Council, city staff presented a map of the fiber-optic cable route the tech giant was installing. Light on detail, the map left many neighborhood members wondering where the cable would be laid, and how it would impact them. "It's uh...It's a good map, but it's not as detailed as I was looking for," says Douglas Boom. Yes, Google Fiber Will Continue In San Antonio, Says Google And City By Paul Flahive • Nov 3, 2016 City of San Antonio A little over a week after their CEO stepped down, they announced layoffs and the suspension of expanding in other cities Google Fiber once again reaffirmed its commitment to offering their high-speed internet to San Antonio at the City Council's B-session Wednesday. Tyler Wallis, Google Fiber manager for  San Antonio, echoing earlier statements to the press, says San Antonio will still receive the high-speed service and the reported 9 percent layoffs from the company won't impact the roll out here. © 2017 Texas Public Radio About TPR Support TPR Financial Reports Public Events Calendar Employment/EEO Community Advisory Board Nominations Privacy Policy Contact TPR

Is Pioneering a New Cloud Strategy. Will It Work? Everyone is watching. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 8, 2017 at 5:28PM Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be leading the growing market for cloud infrastructure, but Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is still putting up a fight. Cloud infrastructure vendors have been crucial in enabling smaller start-ups, particularly those that are building mobile apps, to get up and running without having to worry as much about the back end. It's an appealing model since it allows smaller companies to simply pay for what they need without having to invest in building the infrastructure themselves. In other words, it's an OpEx model versus a CapEx model, and Google is betting big that the market is going to shift to the OpEx model in a major way in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images. But as companies grow, they often choose to invest in their own cloud infrastructure. This gives them much more control over their own destinies, reduces risk, and over time the cost efficiencies improve after the large upfront investment. Social media peers Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter both operate their own data centers; Facebook announced its seventh data center a few months back, while Twitter's infrastructure operations are expanding more slowly, as it operates in co-located facilities. Data centers are so strategically important to Facebook that it helped create the Open Compute Project back in 2011, publicly sharing Facebook's infrastructure innovations for the greater good. But not Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Hey, big spender Snap primarily relies on Google Cloud for its infrastructure needs. While this is entirely par for the course for mobile app start-ups, Snap has grown to a size (nearly 160 million daily active users) that would typically warrant investing in infrastructure. The sheer scale of Snap's use of Google Cloud is what's unprecedented here. The Information reports that Google landed Snap with numerous discounts and other benefits, and Snap very much relies on Google Cloud at this point, although it also uses Amazon's AWS to a lesser degree. Back in 2014, Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said the company picked Google Cloud over AWS because the company could scale better on Google Cloud. Snap poached AWS' head of data centers in October of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may imply that Snap has longer-term ambitions to build out its own infrastructure. But for now, Snap is firmly in bed with Google Cloud, and spends quite a bit of money. Infrastructure costs comprise the bulk of Snap's cost of revenue. From the S-1: "Cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products. Hosting costs primarily include expenses related to bandwidth, computing, and storage costs." Cost of revenue in 2016 was $452 million, and Snap has committed to spending $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years. But at what cost? In discussing its operating leverage, Snap believes that using a capital-light business model will translate into "lower costs for us in both the short and long term." That's definitely true in the short term, but much more debatable in the long term. Having a larger proportion of fixed costs actually helps with operating leverage as the business grows, since those fixed costs get spread out over an increasing revenue base over time, reducing total average costs. In contrast, if a company's cost structure has a larger proportion of variable costs, those costs will scale commensurately with revenue, so you don't get as much margin expansion. It's already telling that Snap's cost of revenue exceeded revenue in 2016 ($405 million), resulting in negative gross margin. We saw this all play out years ago in the semiconductor industry, with the rise of the "fab-less" and "fab-lite" models that are dominant today. Building a chip fab costs billions of dollars, which was a significant barrier to entry. Then contract chip manufacturers came around and allowed companies to focus more on designing the chips while the manufacturing partners would produce them. By outsourcing production to a few large chip manufacturers, the industry collectively saved billions and innovation flourished. Semiconductors mostly shifted to the OpEx model long ago, and there are only a handful of companies that currently manufacture their own chips these days. Snap is wading into uncharted territory by relying on third-party infrastructure partners at this scale. Whether or not this proves right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grows from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspiring start-ups and infrastructure vendors will be watching closely to see how this experiment unfolds.

Given that LG and other Android Wear OEMs chose to pass on releasing new devices last year, we guess the release of new smartwatches this year shouldn’t be that surprising, and if you are curious about the watches, you’ll be pleased to learn that they are now official. In an announcement on Google’s blog, both the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport have been officially announced alongside Android Wear 2.0. Both watches will naturally come with Android Wear 2.0 preloaded onto them, which according to Google will come with more personalized and helpful watch faces, a better way to workout with Google Fit, more ways that users can respond to messages, and it also brings Google Assistant onto your wrist. Out of the two watches, it seems that the LG Watch Sport comes loaded with more features. The LG Watch Style, based on Google’s description, sounds like a very typical smartwatch and nothing more. If you’re after something that is functional and aesthetically pleasing than the Watch Style might be for you. However if you’re after more robust features, the Watch Sport could be a better choice as it comes with NFC that will help with mobile payments, GPS for tracking and navigational functionality, a heart rate sensor, cellular connectivity, and also dedicated buttons for Google Fit and Android Pay. Both the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport are expected to be made available come 10th of February, 2017. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Android Wear, LG, Smartwatch and Wearable Tech.

SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link A photo posted to the ''Say NO to Sanija Fashion'' page. Photo: Facebook A University of NSW conference on industrial relations issues will on Thursday hear that fashion models are increasingly at risk of exploitation in the gig economy with little legal protection against being underpaid or unpaid or sexually harassed. Many fashion and photographic models do not formally have an employer or a fixed place of work to qualify for protection under the Fair Work Act. If this trend continues into the future it will mean the total collapse of modelling as a form of employment. Michael Walker Michael Walker, a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney and communications officer at the modelling union – the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association – will present a paper to the conference raising concerns about an increasing proportion of models engaged in informal employment. "If this trend continues into the future it will mean the total collapse of modelling as a form of employment and a degeneration into informal employment," he said. "The protections of the Fair Work Act, with respect to pay, simply do not apply in an industry where almost no one works a 40-hour week and the small number who do are paid well above the award." After flying back early from a family holiday in Canada for the photo shoot in August last year, Ms Fern asked for a contract and more details about where the photos would be used. "I felt that I had done everything I could to make an informed, business savvy decision that aligned with my morals and would not impede on my career as an actress," she said. "I was told during the shoot that some poses were needed for lighting and reference and that at the poses I wanted would be done after. Three hours were spent on these "reference" photos and 15 minutes on the shots that I had asked for." After receiving a copy of some of the photos Ms Fern was "horrified at the results". "None of the lighting or poses I had expressed in my wishes were delivered in the photos and instead the ones the client used were the "reference" shots," she said. "I was extremely unhappy with the photos and they made me feel exploited, used and I doubted I would ever have a career in the modelling industry, given the unethical way this "job" was conducted." Mr Walker said traditional modelling agencies are now often bypassed by models who accept jobs through social media, which provides little protection against exploitation. He said modelling, like acting and performing, is a form of "gig" employment. "Having a lot of Instagram followers means that a person can become a recognised face without having to go through the traditional gatekeepers, the agencies," he said. "People can put themselves directly out there on Facebook and Instagram and get work directly from that. "It gives people more control over their personal brand, which is a good thing, but the down side of it is, it is just a payment for service." Because modelling was such a competitive career without barriers to entry, many models were underpaid or not paid at all. Some were paid in the form of product samples. If they are not paid at all, they are told that the exposure may help build their career. "It may be that some people, including some of the models in question, don't really care and that modelling is not seen as a paid job as long as people have fun and learn from the experience," Mr Walker said. "This is a defeatist argument that could be just as easily said of actors and musicians. "It could be said of any job that a person enjoys." 29 comments Log in to comment New User?

Six years after it lost the crown to Apple Inc., Google Inc. has reclaimed the title of the most valuable brand in the world. For Android fans, the reversal of fortune is especially gratifying given that much of Apple’s luster was largely due to the success of its iPhone. “Google won out mainly because Apple’s fall was even more dramatic. The iPhone company saw its value drop by 26%,” said HowMuch.Net. As of 2017, Alphabet’s GOOGL, +0.58% GOOG, +0.51%  Google brand is worth $109.47 billion, and Apple AAPL, -0.23%  is valued at $107.14 billion. See larger map “The market is volatile and their survival is precarious. Huge, wealthy brands can stumble and shrink to a ghost of their former selves,” HowMuch said. Brand value is more than just how much money companies are worth, according to the cost-estimating website. It also captures the abstract quality of how much confidence consumers have in the brand, as well as name recognition. Following closely on Apple’s heels is Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.74%  at $106.37 billion. AT&T Inc. T, +0.17%  comes in at fourth with $87.2 billion and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.09%   rounds out the top five at $76.27 billion, underscoring the dominance and the prestige of U.S. brands across the globe. Samsung 005930, -0.10% the Korean conglomerate that makes everything from Galaxy smartphones to apparel, was sixth with a brand value of $66.2 billion. The only other non-American brand to crack the top 10 list was Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, at $47.8 billion, Brand Finance data show. Brand Finance Aside from the predominance of tech names in the U.S., banks were the most valuable in eight countries, although with the exception of Santander in Spain, most did not have much global recognition, according to HowMuch. Energy companies and telecommunication brands also popped up fairly often on the map. More from MarketWatch What’s really behind Trump’s bungling of the immigration-ban order?

His credit score - a number reflecting credit worthiness based on past financial behaviour - has always been over 800. So he was staggered to see in January his score had plunged by 110 points to 737, which is below the national average. "I was very disappointed because I haven't applied for any credit since September 2015 and I believe my score should have stayed where it was," said David, who asked for his surname to be withheld. Related Content Peer-to-peer lenders lead increase in personal loans Veda ruling shows need for oversight "I feel Veda should have notified all its customers to say the scoring model has changed, because I was told thousands have been affected." Veda has confirmed to Fairfax Media that it changed its scoring model in January, meaning some people's scores may have increased or decreased. It maintains credit reports for millions of Australians. Advertisement A spokeswoman said it notified subscribers of the change at the end of last year. She said it could only notify subscribers because of constraints under privacy laws. It's understood the new model incorporates Comprehensive Credit Data. Veda now uses account limits and repayment history for the past two years. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Veda, a credit reporting bureau, was bought by US credit reporting behemoth Equifax for $2.5 billion in early 2016. Photo: Anthony Johnson "This new model allows for the inclusion of Comprehensive Credit Reporting information as this builds over time and also gives new weighting to the key behaviours that may impact an individual's credit worthiness," a spokeswoman said. "Most people won't have seen a change in their VedaScore, or an impact in their ability to secure credit." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Most consumers aren't aware that making multiple credit inquiries can reduce their credit score because it can indicate financial stress. Photo: Jessica Shapiro She reminded consumers that shopping around for credit and making multiple inquiries in a short period of time can indicate financial stress and therefore impact the score. A bad credit score can reduce a consumer's ability to borrow from banks, mortgage companies, and other credit providers. Credit scores sit between zero to 1200, and the national average is 757. An "excellent" VedaScore is between 833 to 1200, "very good" is between 726 to 832, "good" is between 622 to 725, "average" is between 510 to 621 and "below average" is 509 or less. David regularly checks his credit score and credit report and was disappointed to see his credit worthiness status had dropped from "excellent" to "very good". "They said they're not going to look at this again, so I'm not sure what I can do," he said. Fairfax Media is aware of one person who expected her credit score to have increased. Instead, it had dropped by 20 points. Alexandra Kelly from the Financial Rights Legal Centre said the changes were further evidence the scoring system was "completely opaque". "It's not a good indicator of anything as there is no reliability as to the methodology of the scoring due to the lack of transparency," she said. "For most consumers it would feel completely arbitrary and completely outside of their control making it almost useless as any real indicator." Ms Kelly said few credit providers had started reporting repayment history, for example, and those that are may not be doing so consistently. "There will be greater capacity for errors simply because of the increase in the amount and regularity of information able to be reported," she said. "Issues around how financial hardship will be dealt with under the new regime are still the subject of debate and we are concerned that consumers may be detrimentally affected." In December, the Australian Privacy Commissioner found Veda had breached privacy rules when it sold commercial products to consumers who simply wanted a copy of their credit report, which, by law, they're able to access for free once a year. Consumers should obtain a copy of their report each year to make sure all the information is correct.

There have been small incremental updates to the first generation OS along the way, but this is by far the largest upgrade since the operating system's launch in 2014. Wear 2.0 was announced last year at Google I/O in May, but after a few developer previews the release has been delayed for months. Today's launch also comes with two new flagship devices from LG. The new LG Watch Style ($249) and LG Watch Sport ($349) use rounded P-OLED displays powered by the Snapdragon Wear 2100 SoC, 4GB of internal storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, wireless charging along with dust and water resistance. Android Wear 2.0 brings improvements to material design, Android Pay support, fitness tracking, notification updates, new watch faces, and brand new standalone apps. Overall, the new user interface replaces complex gestures with more intuitive swipes and presses. Google Now can be launched right from the watch with the push of a button. Other new home screen features include support for 3rd party elements like stock tracking, weather, and favorite contacts. Google has had to face some fierce competition in the fitness tracking market, so this was another key addition for the upgrade. GPS enabled watches no longer require a phone for location tracking, and Google Fit can automatically detect your workout and give you tips along the way. Smartwatches have historically been good for viewing notifications, but not exactly the most practical for actually replying to them. Wear 2.0 introduces new response features to hopefully change that. The new Smart Reply feature generates generic responses based on the app you're using. This means replies to a business email will be different from a text to your buddy. If the canned replies don't fit what you're trying to say, you can always dictate your response or try the new swiping keyboard and handwriting recognition system. Android Pay has received new integrations to compete with Apple Pay. NFC-enabled watches, of which only one available model exists, can now be used at smart point-of-sales stations. It still takes time to load the app and confirm the payment, but if can save you if you're caught without a wallet, so look for better adoption of this feature in the near future. The final key improvement, and possibly the biggest from a technical perspective, is the addition of standalone apps. With Wear 2.0 you can install apps directly onto the watch itself without the need for a phone. The update to Android Wear 2.0 is a big one, improving on just about every feature previously available. Noted, there are a few bugs at launch of course, but once time settles on the new software and newer hardware is released, we'll be able to see how the new breed of smartwatches fare on the market.

Visitors can view and read the Dead Sea Scrolls in high definition, including some of the earliest known versions of the Ten Commandments and the Book of Genesis. Google and the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Tuesday the launch of the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library. The library features 5,000 high-definition images of the scrolls. In an announcement made on Google's blog, Eyal Miller, head of new business development at Google Israel, and Yossi Matias, head of Israel research and development, said the Dead Sea Scrolls were “written more than 2,000 years ago on pieces of parchment and papyrus; they were preserved by the hot, dry desert climate and the darkness of the caves in which they were hidden. The scrolls are possibly the most important archaeological discovery of the 20th century.”  [[nid:948738]] The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in a cave near the Dead Sea in the 1940s, the Associated Press notes. Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls include the earliest known versions of the Book of Deuteronomy, as well as the first chapter of the Book of Genesis. Other scrolls contain texts that discuss life during the time of Jesus and his teachings as well as Judaic history, notes Google. Each image of the Dead Sea Scrolls is presented in 1215 dpi resolution, letting viewers zoom in and look at them in amazing clarity. Putting the Dead Sea Scrolls online lets scholars, historians and the curious examine these important manuscripts with ease. According to Shuka Dorfman, director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, “Only five conservators worldwide are authorized to handle the Dead Sea Scrolls. Now, everyone can touch the scroll on screen around the globe,” notes AP. It took two years for Google to get the Dead Sea Scrolls online, according to AP. Each image of the Dead Sea Scrolls will feature a translation as well as a map indicating where the text was discovered. A video describing the history of the Dead Sea Scrolls, their discovery and Google's effort to put the manuscripts online is below. Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Six years after it lost the crown to Apple Inc., Google Inc. has reclaimed the title of the most valuable brand in the world. For Android fans, the reversal of fortune is especially gratifying given that much of Apple’s luster was largely due to the success of its iPhone. “Google won out mainly because Apple’s fall was even more dramatic. The iPhone company saw its value drop by 26%,” said HowMuch.Net. As of 2017, Alphabet’s GOOGL, +0.58% GOOG, +0.51%  Google brand is worth $109.47 billion, and Apple AAPL, -0.23%  is valued at $107.14 billion. See larger map “The market is volatile and their survival is precarious. Huge, wealthy brands can stumble and shrink to a ghost of their former selves,” HowMuch said. Brand value is more than just how much money companies are worth, according to the cost-estimating website. It also captures the abstract quality of how much confidence consumers have in the brand, as well as name recognition. Following closely on Apple’s heels is Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.74%  at $106.37 billion. AT&T Inc. T, +0.17%  comes in at fourth with $87.2 billion and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.09%   rounds out the top five at $76.27 billion, underscoring the dominance and the prestige of U.S. brands across the globe. Samsung 005930, -0.10% the Korean conglomerate that makes everything from Galaxy smartphones to apparel, was sixth with a brand value of $66.2 billion. The only other non-American brand to crack the top 10 list was Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, at $47.8 billion, Brand Finance data show. Brand Finance Aside from the predominance of tech names in the U.S., banks were the most valuable in eight countries, although with the exception of Santander in Spain, most did not have much global recognition, according to HowMuch. Energy companies and telecommunication brands also popped up fairly often on the map.

His credit score - a number reflecting credit worthiness based on past financial behaviour - has always been over 800. So he was staggered to see in January his score had plunged by 110 points to 737, which is below the national average. "I was very disappointed because I haven't applied for any credit since September 2015 and I believe my score should have stayed where it was," said David, who asked for his surname to be withheld. Related Content Peer-to-peer lenders lead increase in personal loans Veda ruling shows need for oversight "I feel Veda should have notified all its customers to say the scoring model has changed, because I was told thousands have been affected." Veda has confirmed to Fairfax Media that it changed its scoring model in January, meaning some people's scores may have increased or decreased. It maintains credit reports for millions of Australians. Advertisement A spokeswoman said it notified subscribers of the change at the end of last year. She said it could only notify subscribers because of constraints under privacy laws. It's understood the new model incorporates Comprehensive Credit Data. Veda now uses account limits and repayment history for the past two years. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Veda, a credit reporting bureau, was bought by US credit reporting behemoth Equifax for $2.5 billion in early 2016. Photo: Anthony Johnson "This new model allows for the inclusion of Comprehensive Credit Reporting information as this builds over time and also gives new weighting to the key behaviours that may impact an individual's credit worthiness," a spokeswoman said. "Most people won't have seen a change in their VedaScore, or an impact in their ability to secure credit." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Most consumers aren't aware that making multiple credit inquiries can reduce their credit score because it can indicate financial stress. Photo: Jessica Shapiro She reminded consumers that shopping around for credit and making multiple inquiries in a short period of time can indicate financial stress and therefore impact the score. A bad credit score can reduce a consumer's ability to borrow from banks, mortgage companies, and other credit providers. Credit scores sit between zero to 1200, and the national average is 757. An "excellent" VedaScore is between 833 to 1200, "very good" is between 726 to 832, "good" is between 622 to 725, "average" is between 510 to 621 and "below average" is 509 or less. David regularly checks his credit score and credit report and was disappointed to see his credit worthiness status had dropped from "excellent" to "very good". "They said they're not going to look at this again, so I'm not sure what I can do," he said. Fairfax Media is aware of one person who expected her credit score to have increased. Instead, it had dropped by 20 points. Alexandra Kelly from the Financial Rights Legal Centre said the changes were further evidence the scoring system was "completely opaque". "It's not a good indicator of anything as there is no reliability as to the methodology of the scoring due to the lack of transparency," she said. "For most consumers it would feel completely arbitrary and completely outside of their control making it almost useless as any real indicator." Ms Kelly said few credit providers had started reporting repayment history, for example, and those that are may not be doing so consistently. "There will be greater capacity for errors simply because of the increase in the amount and regularity of information able to be reported," she said. "Issues around how financial hardship will be dealt with under the new regime are still the subject of debate and we are concerned that consumers may be detrimentally affected." In December, the Australian Privacy Commissioner found Veda had breached privacy rules when it sold commercial products to consumers who simply wanted a copy of their credit report, which, by law, they're able to access for free once a year. Consumers should obtain a copy of their report each year to make sure all the information is correct.

More videos Samsung addresses exploding phones Samsung started off its CES event in Las Vegas with a mea culpa over its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. A fire broke out at a Samsung SDI factory in China this week when faulty, discarded batteries ignited, setting trash and other items ablaze. The fire at the Samsung Electronics affiliate's factory in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin has been extinguished, a Samsung spokesman said, adding that there were no casualties or significant impact to the plant's operations. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Social media users posted pictures of the factory fire online. Photo: Weibo According to the spokesman the fire broke out not on the production line itself but in a part of the facility used for waste, including faulty batteries. He added that most of the factory was running as normal. The local fire department, however, said on social media that the fire was caused by batteries inside the facility. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The local fire brigade confirmed faulty batteries were to blame. Photo: Weibo The "material that caught fire was lithium batteries inside the production workshops and some half-finished products", the Wuqing branch of the Tianjin Fire Department said in a post on its verified Sina Weibo account. It added it had sent out 110 firefighters and 19 trucks to put out the fire. SDI is set to start supplying batteries for Samsung's upcoming flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 in the first quarter of this year. The S8 comes after the Galaxy Note7, which suffered a global recall last year due to battery defects. Samsung said last month that SDI and China's Amperex Technology, the two battery suppliers for the Note7, were to blame for the product failure that cost it $US5.3 billion in operating profit. The Tianjin plant is one of five production centres by SDI in China and a major one for small batteries used in phones. Reuters, with Fairfax Media 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

The new launch will allow users to search across G Suite products, including Drive, Gmail, Sites, Calendar, Docs and Contacts. The service was previously known as Springboard and was only available in a limited preview. The service has been rebranded as Cloud search and is designed for larger companies where different members of the corporation are able to access different files. TechCrunch reports that the service respects file sharing permissions so users are only able to access the content that’s been made available to them. Furthermore however, Cloud Search also functions as a directory service, Colleagues can also use the service to find each other’s contact information, while viewing the events and projects they’re both a part of. This is just one example of how Google has incorporated machine learning into its products in the past few months. The ‘Quick Access’ feature in Drive is another example of this initiative. The system uses a card-sorting interface that Google claims utilizes machine intelligence to help users be more productive by predicting the information they’re currently need to access. Cloud Search will be rolling out globally for customers using G Suite Business and Enterprise products.

Verizon, not to be outdone by the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, announced the Wear24 on Wednesday, a watch running Google’s Android Wear operating system. The Wear24 was made in partnership with ODM Quanta, a Taiwanese company better known by the branded laptops, desktops, and media players it builds for commissioning companies like HP, Dell, and Lenovo. It’s a Verizon exclusive, unsurprisingly, and one of the first smartwatches to ship running version 2.0 of Google’s Android Wear operating system. More: Will your watch get Android Wear 2.0? Read our guide to find out The Wear24’s a compelling package, to be sure. Its “slim and modern” 13.5mm body is IP67-rated, meaning it can withstand up to 3.3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. And under the hood lies 512MB of RAM, a beefy 450mAh battery compatible with off-the-shelf wireless chargers, a NFC chip that supports tap-to-pay mobile transactions, and a 1.39-inch AMOLED display with 290 pixels per inch. It boasts full compatibility with Verizon’s LTE network, too, meaning the Wear24 can make and receive phone calls and texts without the need for a smartphone. Thanks to Android Wear 2.0, the Wear24 ships with loads of useful features. New watch faces boast “Complications,” miniature widgets for notifications and shortcuts for apps that put upcoming calendar appointments, fitness goal progress, and more at a glance. A new version of Google Fit, Google’s cross-platform fitness tracker, tracks your pace, distance, heart rate, and the calories you’ve burned during workouts. And new messaging features let you respond to texts and messages with a keyboard. One of the bigger additions is the Google Assistant, cloud-powered AI software capable of performing actions like setting reminders, finding directions to a specified point of interest, telling you the weather, booking a restaurant, and more. More: Android Wear is back in business with two new watches from LG The Wear24 will launch online and in Verizon stores next month for $300 with a two-year contract, which lines up roughly with the carrier’s Watch Sport pricing ($330 on a two-year contract or $380 full retail). It might seem odd that Verizon’s effectively competing against its partners with the Wear24, but it’s not the first time. In 2013, it launched the Ellipsis, an Android tablet designed to compete with affordable 7-inch tablets like the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7. That lineup has since expanded to include an 8-inch Model, the Ellipsis 8, and the 10-inch Ellipsis 10. Verizon notes that the Wear24 is compatible with its $10 Single Device Plan, which provisions 1GB, unlimited talk, and unlimited text for a connected device. Alternatively, existing subscribers can add the Wear24 to their plan for an extra $5 per month. Android Wear is back in business with two new watches from LG Will your watch get Android Wear 2.0?

Name: Subject: Message: Google combines YouTube Music and Play Music teams, may merge apps later Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 11 1013 37 Right now, Google has two music streaming apps, YouTube Music and Google Play Music. If you’re wondering why the two apps aren’t combined into one, well, it looks like the company has the same questions as well. Today, Google confirmed that it has decided to combine its YouTube Music and Google Play Music teams into one unit. This move likely means Google will be merging both apps at some point so it can have one unified music streaming experience. See also: Problems with Google Play Music and how to fix them 2 weeks ago The report comes from The Verge, who received a statement from Google saying that music as a whole is “very important” to the company. It added that it is now “evaluating how to bring together [its] music offerings to deliver the best possible product for [its] users, music partners and artists.” Google didn’t announce any plans to merge the YouTube Music and Google Play Music apps, though it did say that it will reveal its plans with “plenty of notice before any changes are made.” The company previously combined the business development teams of YouTube Music and Google Play Music into one in 2016, in order to quickly make deals with music artists and record labels. It would seem the writing is on the wall in this particular case. Google Play Music is certainly the more popular service out of the two, so we wouldn’t be surprised if YouTube Music was folded into Play Music. After all, the YouTube brand is better known for its video offerings anyway. In fact, signing up for a Google Play Music subscription already gives you full access to YouTube Music and YouTube Red, which ditches all those pesky video ads on the service. And while we don’t have any details on the future of Play Music/YouTube Music at the moment, this move does make quite a bit of sense. In a world where Apple Music and Spotify exist, Google needs to have one unified streaming service that can take on the other heavy hitters in the space. Speaking of YouTube, earlier this week it announced that it had opened up live mobile video streaming on the service, but only if your channel has more than 10,000 subscribers. Since both Facebook and Twitter offer the same thing with no such restrictions, we wonder what’s keeping Google from offering this to everyone.

If Magistrate Thomas Rueter's ruling stands, anyone using US-based internet companies will have to live with the knowledge that, as far as the US government is concerned, it's America wherever they operate. That's a dangerous approach that hurts the international expansion of US tech companies. Privacy-minded customers in Europe are already suspicious of the US government's cooperation with the tech giants, revealed by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Nationalist politicians in some countries -- for example, Marine Le Pen of the French National Front -- want to ban cross-border personal data transfers, arguing that such data must be stored on servers inside the internet user's country. That, however, does not appear to guarantee that the US won't get at it, either. Last July, Microsoft won a landmark case against the US government, in which it argued it didn't have to hand over e-mails stored on a server in Dublin to investigators working on a drug case. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the corporation, ruling that the US Congress never meant the Stored Communications Act to apply extraterritorially. Just two weeks ago, the court allowed the ruling to stand. The government may yet appeal it to the Supreme Court, but in the meantime, US internet firms have assumed that if communications are stored abroad, they are out of the US authorities' reach. Acting on that understanding, Google refused to disclose two users' data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI went to court in Philadelphia. Unlike Microsoft, Google doesn't even know the physical location of a file: its artificial intelligence-based system constantly optimises storage, so bits of one file can be stored in several geographic locations at once. Judge Rueter refused to be bound by the Microsoft precedent. In his ruling, he disagreed with it, arguing that as long as an American Google employee gets the data using a computer located in the US, nothing extraterritorial is taking place: "When Google produces the electronic data in accordance with the search warrants and the government views it, the actual invasion of the account holders' privacy -- the searches -- will occur in the United States." Within that logic, any information, public or private, that the US government can locate using computers on US territory is fair game. And if the logic applies, the European Union (EU) wasted its time last year as it tried to establish an acceptable privacy standard for US companies operating in Europe. A new framework for these companies became necessary after the European Court of Justice struck down the EU's so-called safe harbour agreement with the United States, which allowed internet companies to shuttle personal data back and forth between the two jurisdictions based on an understanding that the US provided adequate protection for users' privacy. The so-called Privacy Shield, which replaced the "safe harbour" arrangement, is still pretty permissive, allowing companies to self-certify their commitment to user privacy, but it simplifies redress and gives European data privacy authorities more power over cross-border communication. If, however, the US decides that it can just take the data from foreign servers, the new agreement will be rendered meaningless. For US companies, this will mean a need to invent new private arrangements to protect European customers, the kind Microsoft proposed in 2015. It appointed Deutsche Telekom "data trustee" for two data centres in Germany, making it impossible for anyone, including Microsoft itself, to obtain any information from the servers without the permission of the trustee and, ultimately, the client. Such tricks, however, may not stand up in US courts, if other judges agree with Mr Rueter. The US Supreme Court will probably have to take a stand on the issue: Google has already decided to appeal Mr Rueter's ruling, and now that there are conflicting precedents, the government, too, will definitely want to pursue the battle to the bitter end. Waiting for a decision, millions of foreigners must decide whether to cut their losses in this front of the online privacy wars: It may no longer be okay to expose their lives to US corporations. Those who are uneasy about the degree of the US government's reach into their private files and communications need to start thinking about alternatives, no matter how hard it may be to replace Google, Microsoft or Facebook. As the US becomes more hostile toward foreigners under President Donald Trump, there's no telling why the US government may be asked to collect information. Some travellers to the US are already being asked to reveal their social network histories in a broad search for terrorist connections. What if the government didn't even have to ask? ©2017 Bloomberg View Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Prior to Google/Alphabet, Barratt was president of Qualcomm Atheros.   RELATED: Google Fiber Pauses Expansion Plans, Laying Off Some Staff He is joining Barefoot Networks amid the development of Tofino, a 6.5 Tbps Ethernet switch chip, which is in sampling mode, and Capilano, a software platform.   "I'm excited about Barefoot's vision to transform networks by enabling programmability in high-performance switching," Barratt said in a statement. "I'm delighted to join the team and to help them build on the incredible progress they are making in achieving that vision."   Barefoot launched in 2016 after spending two years in the product development phase. It’s backed by Google, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategic Investments, Alibaba, Tencent, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Andreessen Horowitz. It has raised about $155.35 million, according to CrunchBase. Want to read more stories like this? Get our Free Newsletter Here!

We’ve yet to get our hands on units (our reviews are on the way!), but so far it looks like the consensus is about what I expected: There’s lots of new useful features in the latest — albeit delayed — version of Android Wear, but in a variety of ways, these watches don’t show it off as well as they could… Engadget notes that Android Wear is all grown up with 2.0 in its review of the LG Watch Sport, which is about what we would expect with a software update that Google worked on for more than a year. During the week I’ve been testing the Watch Sport, there’s one thought I’ve kept coming back to: Android Wear is all grown up. More importantly, performance is mostly smooth now. Obviously, the robust hardware helps keep things running nicely, but Android Wear has never felt this fast or flexible, even on watches with basically the same components. And Time says Android Wear 2.0 is a lot easier to navigate: Among Android Wear 2.0’s biggest improvements is how much easier it is to navigate. It’s simpler to launch apps, manage notifications, and customize watch faces. On round watches, like the LG Watch Style I used to review the upgraded software, the app menu leans into the device’s curves as you scroll, resulting in a smooth aesthetic I prefer over the Apple Watch’s bubbly launch screen. Android Wear 2.0 also opens up a lot of possibilities for those who use an iPhone as the device they want to pair their Android Wear watch to. The Verge notes the benefits of Android Wear 2.0’s built-in Play Store: If you are using a Wear 2.0 watch with an iPhone, you’ll be able to install apps on the watch without having to go through Apple’s App Store. This makes Android Wear a much more feasible option for iPhone users than before, but it still doesn’t support iMessage, so not everything is golden. But while Android Wear 2.0 might have a lot of useful improvements across the board, it’s still not revolutionary. It mostly just brings Android Wear up to par with the competition as TechCrunch notes: Wear 2.0 doesn’t feel revolutionary. It is, however, a perfectly adequate update that addresses many of the issues with Android Wear. It also puts it on parity with its competitors, like Apple’s watchOS or Samsung’s Tizen. Ron Amadeo at Ars, in his over 7,000 word review of the two watches and their software, touched on one of the bigger downsides with Android Wear 2.0, however, which is that Google/LG hasn’t fixed the problem of slowness when cold booting. Apparently, Assistant is a frustrating experience: If you open Assistant and run several queries in a row, it will start to speed up, but you’ll mostly need it during a “cold boot” scenario, and this is where the Assistant fails. It will be off for a long time and loaded out of memory, and you’ll shout “OK Google” or press the crown, and it will laboriously load onto the screen. Even the animations stutter and skip—it’s like it was designed for much more powerful hardware and forced onto a low-end device. On the hardware side, Amadeo takes note of the LG Watch Sport’s thick and non-exchangeable bands: As a result of the embedded antennas, the band isn’t entirely flexible—the first inch of the band on each side is rigid. There is no actual hinge connecting the band to the watch, and the rigid band only starts flexing after the antenna section. It might not fit as snugly on smaller wrists as you would expect. But notes that using the “Digital Crown” is actually a joy: Scrolling with the crown is a joy. In addition to not obstructing the screen, it’s fast and more precise than touch scrolling. With one or two hard spins, you can be at the bottom of any list. When you need to be more precise, it’s easy to slowly spin the wheel. It’s also great for reading longer messages on the tiny screen. The Verge says that the LG Watch Sport is — as can be seen in photos — a pretty huge timepiece that probably won’t fit too well on average size (or smaller) wrists: It’s a big, honking timepiece on your wrist that’s thick, chunky, and has a stiff rubber strap that can’t be swapped out. It isn’t particularly comfortable to wear, either, even on my medium-to-large sized wrist. One common theme seems to be that overall performance for both watches, while — once again — not revolutionary, has seriously benefitted from Google’s hands-on involvement in some areas. And Richard Gao at Android Police says that performance on the Style is better than expected: In terms of performance, the Watch Style blows any other Android Wear watch I’ve ever used out of the water. Animations are insanely smooth, lag is virtually nonexistent, and the whole experience just felt effortless. Wired notes that neither watch really solves the problem of battery life: Neither model fixes the biggest, thorniest smartwatch problem: battery life. With fairly tame use, I got 24 hours of battery life, though a workout or phone call sends the battery plummeting. Whichever model you get, you’ll charge it every night. Nobody needs another device to charge every night. Engadget also touches on battery life for the LG Watch Style, but adds that it falls short in a lot of other ways: no NFC (meaning no Android Pay), and some might find its design bland: Ultimately, the LG Watch Style feels more like a proof of concept than a smartwatch for consumers. It shows how well Android Wear 2.0 can perform when Google collaborates with a device maker to make sure new hardware input methods are integrated properly into the interface. But almost everything else about the Style, from its bland design to its dismal battery life, is disappointing. Overall, it sounds like these watches are good — and just that. If you look at them spec for spec, you’ll see that they are a lot like what we’ve seen in watches over the last couple years. And while Android Wear 2.0 is definitely a big step forward, it doesn’t really put Google ahead. NFC payments have been available on the Apple Watch for years, for example, and they’re just now coming to Google’s platform — and only to the larger, more bulky watch. It seems like Google has run into a bit of a technological hurdle with these watches. People want the price and size and design of the LG Watch Style, but they also want NFC (Android Pay) and good battery life. Neither of these watches really have great battery life, and even the larger of the two has a lot of compromises. And I think that’s the conclusion we can take from these reviews: there’s still no smartwatch on the market that doesn’t have substantial compromises. We’ll have our hands on the watches this week and we’ll let you know our own thoughts soon. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

The combined team is working to eventually unify Google’s music services. Google informed its staff about these changes Wednesday morning, and confirmed them with the following statement sent to press: “Music is very important to Google and we’re evaluating how to bring together our music offerings to deliver the best possible product for our users, music partners and artists. Nothing will change for users today and we’ll provide plenty of notice before any changes are made.” The Verge was first to report on the changes Wednesday, but Google CEO Sundar Pichai actually dropped a hint at these changes during last week’s Alphabet earnings call, where he said: “I would think about it as we’re investing a lot in developing this premium experience. We have YouTube Red, YouTube Music and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well. You will see us invest more. More countries, more original content. And we’ll bring together the experiences we have over the course of this year so it’s even more compelling for users.” Google is known for often having multiple teams working on the same problem, and music subscriptions have been no different for the company. Google Play Music was initially under the helm of the Android group, which was spearheaded by Android founder Andy Rubin. After Rubin’s departure, a power shift led to YouTube gaining influence, and the two teams started to use some shared resources under YouTube’s helm. Most notably, all of the music partnership and licensing work has already been done by YouTube for some time, multiple sources told Variety this week. The big question for Google going forward is how it will eventually market and brand its paid music service. YouTube has a far stringer brand than Google Play Music, but most users also associate YouTube with free content — which could make it harder to get people to sign up for a paid service.   Filed Under: Alphabet Google Google Play Music Youtube Want to read more articles like this one?

Rob Petry says: February 10, 2017 at 10:51 am When are the music labels and artists going to notice their falling subscriber numbers and views. Many of the top acts of Vevo were in the top 25-50 youtube artists in the daily subs and viewers lists. Now they aren’t even in the top 500 obviously the algorithm changed and the Vevo group got clobbered huge loss in subs and views, numbers down. If Pewdiepie’s complaining your in the same boat. Taylor Swift get on this one youtube changed the algorithm and now your never in the top 500 views or subs? Wakeup and smell the money is being taken away.

Zeman   @phonescooper updated Wednesday, 12:31 PM Updated: updated text; added correct link. Google today officially made Android Wear 2.0 available to device makers and the public. The wearable platform has been in preview status since May 2016 and its release has been delayed for several months. Android Wear 2.0 includes a handful of key improvements over earlier versions of the operating system. First, Android Wear apps can now run directly on wearables without a nearby smartphone. Standalone apps will make Android-based wearables more useful on their own. This goes hand-in-hand with added support for LTE data connections built directly into the OS, allowing users to install watch apps directly to their wearable via WiFi or cellular connections. Android Wear 2.0 also adds the Google Play Store, where smartwatch owners will be able to browse for apps via keyword and voice search directly from their wrist. Other features include a circular user interface with swipe-to-dismiss behaviors, one-click Google sign-in, and improved complications. Watch faces, for example, will be able to show data from other apps, such as fitness info. The messaging app gains a significant update, too, thanks to better handwriting recognition, voice controls, and an on-device keyboard. Android Wear 2.0 also supports Apple's iOS so iPhone owners can use Android Wear watches. Last, Android Wear 2.0 brings the new Google Assistant to user's wrists, where people will be able to speak the "OK, Google" command to perform voice-based searches. Android Wear 2.0 will ship on the new LG Watch Sport and Watch Style, which were announced separately, beginning Feb. 10. Google says the platform will reach a number of existing supported devices in the weeks ahead. Some include the Asus ZenWatch 2 and 3; Casio Smart Outdoor and Pro Trek Smart; Fossil Q Found, Marshal, and Wander; Huawei Watch; LG G Watch R, Watch Urbane, Watch Urbane 2nd Ed; Moto 360 (2nd Gen and Sport); New Balance RunIQ; and the Tag Heuer Connected. more info at Google » Related LG Watch Style Is Less Bulky, More Fashionable more LG news   LG phones LG Watch Sport Targets Fitness Buffs, Supports Android Pay more Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

(Google) Chris Fox and Rachael D'Amore, CP24.com Published Wednesday, February 8, 2017 4:15PM EST Last Updated Wednesday, February 8, 2017 6:50PM EST About 20 tenants at a Parkdale apartment building are refusing to pay rent in protest of a five per cent increase being sought by their landlord. The tenants of the building, located at 87 Jameson Avenue, began the rent strike on Feb. 1 after landlord MetCap Living notified them that it would seek approval from the Landlord and Tenant Board to raise rents by five per cent. The maximum allowable rent increase without approval from the Landlord and Tenant Board is 1.5 per cent and tenants say that the large increase is being sought while needed repairs go unaddressed. There are approximately 90 tenants living in the building at this time. “I think they are trying to push away people. Maybe by neglecting some maintenance issues they are trying to push people out,” tenant Aliza Kassam told CTV News Toronto on Wednesday. “It is an eviction with another name and there is definitely a lot of anger. We are not going to step back.” Tenants at the building have complained about faulty heating, problems with pest control and the lack of a wheelchair accessible entrance. They are asking the landlord to abandon the rent increase until improvements are made. “We feel like this is a fight against our community of Parkdale and we are all in this together,” Kassam said, noting that she has heard about similar issues at other buildings in the neighbourhood. Diane Rajaren told CTV News Toronto that she’s lived in her one bedroom apartment at 87 Jameson Avenue for nearly 40 years. She too has joined the effort to bring the repair to the landlord’s attention and, for the first time, has refused to pay her rent this month. “They don’t deserve it because they don’t do a good job,” she said. “If you’re paying rent, you deserve a better living.” Rajaren said she’s been forced to duct tape part of her balcony door to keep cold air from creeping in. Though she says she’s contacted the landlord about getting it fixed, it hasn’t been. She said she often finds her water shut off, as well. Back in 2014, the property manager installed new balconies along the exterior after receiving a work order request from the city. The property manager says that the rent increase is a necessary step to pay off current and future repair needs.

Name: Subject: Message: Google might be planning a purge of zombie apps on Play Store Newsby Brian Reigh2 days ago 15 622 14 According to The Next Web, Google has started sending out an email to developers whose apps do not have a privacy policy, warning that their apps may eventually be removed if no action is taken. This move might finally get rid of millions of so-called “zombie apps” in the Play Store. See also: 7 things the Google Play Store does better than the Apple App Store 2 weeks ago If you own an Android phone, you may already know this: the Play Store is filled with zombie apps that are awful or useless or both. Well, Google knows this, and it seems the latest notices it’s been sending out to developers are an effort to clean up the Play Store. As you can see from the image above, the developers that are receiving this email from Google are lacking one thing: a privacy policy. Google is giving them until mid-March to fix it, or else the visibility of these apps might be restricted or they may be removed from the Play Store altogether, Google warns. Now, it’s entirely possible that a developer might have unintentionally left out a privacy policy; however, what’s far more likely is that Google’s move specifically targets those poor-performing, unverified, amateur filler apps. Without proper maintenance or without proper expertise, these apps will remain without a privacy policy and eventually be removed. This move is great news for several reasons. For the end-user, it means that you know exactly what you’re signing up for. Whichever app you’re using, it should be made clear the terms to which you are agreeing and to what extent you are forfeiting your privacy. Not only that, this means search results won’t be filled with irrelevant, useless or sometimes even harmful apps. Your keyword searches will render more accurate results, benefitting the developers that follow Google’s guidelines. Whereas Apple has a tight control over which apps enter its App Store, Google has always been laxer. However, as its platform matures, so must its Play Store. Although it’s unclear just how effective this potential purge will be, it definitely seems like a step in the right direction.

Features like the Pixel Launcher, round icons, new nav bar buttons, and Google Assistant are still exclusive to the Pixel phones. The good news is that Android is incredibly customizable. With just a few handy apps and some tweaking, you can get most of the Pixel features on your phone. Let’s get started. Pixel Launcher To achieve the look of the Pixel Launcher, we’ll be using one of our favorite Android apps of all time: Nova Launcher. Now, it’s true that you can download the Pixel Launcher APK and get it working on most devices, but Nova offers more options. Plus, it will still get updates. In the video above I ran through all the things you need to change to get the Pixel look, but you don’t actually have to go through all that. There’s an easier way. Install Nova Launcher Download this Nova backup file on your phone Select the downloaded file Open with Nova Launcher Tap OK to Restore backup Note: This will replace your current set up completely. If you don’t want to rearrange your icons again, follow the steps in the video. Round App Icons Next, we need the round icons that Google introduced on the Pixel. There are plenty of icon packs with round icons, but we found the aptly named Pixel Icon Pack to have the closest look. This icon pack has nearly 5,000 (!) custom icons and it’s completely free. For apps that don’t have custom icons, you will see a white circle behind the default icon. Just like the Pixel. Install Pixel Icon Pack Open the app Open the menu and select Apply Tap Nova Launcher Tap OK to Apply icon theme Google Wallpapers The official Pixel Launcher has a special wallpaper app built-in. Google released this app to the Play Store for all devices. If you’re really dedicated to getting the complete Pixel look, you should use the official Google wallpapers. Install Google Wallpapers Open the app Go to the Earth category The default Pixel wallpaper can be found near the bottom. It’s from Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate, Oman. Download it here if you can’t find it. Pixel Nav Bar For most phones, the customization stops at the wallpaper, but if you have a stock Android phone you can go a step further. A new app called Pixbar makes your nav bar buttons look like the Pixel without the need of root. It only works on stock Android phones with Lollipop or above. Pretty much just Nexus and Motorola phones. The app works by putting an overlay on top of the nav bar buttons. Install Pixbar Toggle Show button fill Adjust the scale and spacing to match your nav bar buttons Tap APPLY We’re still waiting for Google Assistant to be available for more Android phones, but in the meantime, you can at least pretend you have the Pixel. The great thing about Android is you can make your phone look like anything you want. Your LG phone can look like a Pixel, or your Pixel can look like an LG phone. Anything is possible.

Sure, the Apple Watch sold well enough that people don’t consider it a total disaster, and enough Android Wear watches are floating around that it seems like at least a few people care, but they’ve hardly been the runaway success that some thought they would be. Always ready for a challenge, Google is doing its best to reinvent its smartwatch platform with the Android Wear 2.0 update, which is finally rolling out after being teased and tested for months. Here’s why it’s a big deal, even if you don’t own a smartwatch (yet). It’s faster than ever Okay, so this is an obvious one, but Android Wear 2.0 makes navigating the interface and launching apps much quicker than it’s been in the past. It still won’t rival your smartphone in terms of boot-up time — that can still take a while, unfortunately — but on-the-go interactions with the watch are now noticeably less bogged down with waiting screens and loading bars. Google Assistant Google Assistant is one of the slickest AI assistants around, so having it on your wrist is pretty much ideal. It works via the same “Ok Google” voice command as it does elsewhere, and can create lists, calendar notifications, and grab directions without having to tap through any menus. Revamped complications Apple Watch devotees blew their collective lids when Apple showed off customizable complications for the first time, and for good reason: Having more information that you actually use on the watch face is never a bad thing. Android Wear 2.0 lets users customize their primary watch screens with calendar alerts, alarms, pedometer data, weather, and other information that requires much less digging than it ever has before. Better messaging Replying to a message without having to take your phone out of your pocket is a pretty huge benefit of owning a smartwatch, but Android Wear’s first attempt at replies was pretty lackluster. In 2.0, replies are both quicker to compose and faster to send thanks to built-in reply buttons for Android Wear-compatible apps, and Google’s handy Smart Reply feature that auto generates possibly replies for you to choose from. Smarter fit For anyone coming to an Android smartwatch from a dedicated fitness band, Google Fit was often lacking smarts. 2.0 sees Fit get a big upgrade. There’s now third party app sharing so that your favorite Android fitness app can play nice with your workout data, and the app is now smarter about knowing when you’ve started working out and when you stop, and has a much better sensor algorithm for figuring out the kind of exercise you’re actually doing, without being told. You don’t need your phone The dream of all smartwatch fans is to eventually have a device that doesn’t even need to be connected to a phone in order to do everything you need it to. Android Wear 2.0 lays the groundwork for that future with support for WiFi and LTE. However, since almost all current Android smartwatches don’t have LTE capabilities — LG’s new Watch Sport is leading the charge in this regard — taking advantage of this feature requires that you invest in an entirely new watch. Still, it’s a promising sign of things to come.

Nothing will change for users right now, and both apps will continue to exist independently for the moment. But the move is likely to pave the way for a single unified music app from Google. The business development teams behind these two apps actually combined last year. That made it simpler for Google to negotiate deals with labels and artists. And subscribing to YouTube Red already gave you access to both services. The rational behind producing two distinct apps has always been a little muddy to me. Here’s what I wrote when YouTube Music first launched: “The fact that YouTube Music and Google Play Music both exist is a touch confusing, especially since you can use them both for free, but they both add a bunch of features if you subscribe to YouTube Red. The best way to understand the new music app is to think of Facebook. Just as the social network broke out Messenger into its own so it could optimize the experience, YouTube now has dedicated apps for its three most popular verticals: kids, gaming, and music.” A spokesperson for Google confirmed the two teams were combining and offered the following statement: “Music is very important to Google and we’re evaluating how to bring together our music offerings to deliver the best possible product for our users, music partners and artists. Nothing will change for users today and we’ll provide plenty of notice before any changes are made.” Combining apps makes sense at a time when the average consumer has stopped downloading new apps or is actually cutting down the number of apps on their phone. And the streaming music business is increasingly competitive, with Apple and Amazon ramping up their offerings and Facebook reportedly eyeing an entry to the market as well.

So why are they so eager to lock themselves into a cloud platform? By Matt Asay | February 8, 2017, 11:24 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/LeoWolfert Googlers have been gloating ever since Snap was required to disclose its $2 billion dependence on Google Cloud Platform in its filing to go public. By RBC Capital's estimates, Google's cloud business was on a $1 billion run rate in 2016, making Snap arguably GCP's biggest customer by far, as well as the biggest source of Snap's financial shortfall, representing roughly 80% of its reported annual losses. Amazon Web Services doesn't have the same financial dependence on a single customer, but it still wasn't about to allow GCP to hog the customer limelight for long. On Wednesday, AWS announced that Live Nation will move all of its global IT infrastructure to the Amazon cloud, adding to a panoply of existing customer case studies. Most interesting in this customer case study tit-for-tat is that the customers in question are effectively signaling a willingness to completely lock themselves into a given platform. We talk about cloud portability, but these customers don't appear to be interested—they're all in. As I've argued, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just can't get enough (of cloud lock-in) Starting with Live Nation, the company touted the benefits of moving its Ticketmaster sites to AWS, saying it "will use AWS Lambda, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Amazon Aurora, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to simplify management of large-scale databases and for storage of logs and static content." Once in, that data isn't coming back out. Not without a lot of money. SEE: Why AWS Lambda could be the worst thing to happen to open source Snap, for its part, acknowledged its deal with Google has it "buil[ding] our software and computer systems to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by Google," which, in case you were wondering, "do not have an alternative in the market." But, of course there are alternatives! AWS, for one. Or Microsoft Azure. Reality is less kind to this view. As Mesosphere CMO Peter Guagenti has highlighted, "every API at the public cloud providers is proprietary to those systems. So, most of the work a company does to aid with deployment or scaling tends to tie you to each public cloud provider's platforms." Or an enterprise could elect to go through extra motions to clone its cloud infrastructure (as Comcast does) with industry standards like MySQL. Others might opt to focus solely on the basic cloud services to avoid getting locked into vendor-specific services. But most won't go these routes because it's not worth the bother, leaving them free to check out any time they like...but they can never leave. Let's call it 'Master and Servant' The point of these announcements, however, is to showcase the giddy upside to lock-in. In the Live Nation press release, David Huckabay, CIO of Live Nation, stated: "We look forward to the positive impact that going all-in on the AWS Cloud will have on our IT infrastructure across our key business divisions." He's not bothered by the lack of an exit plan. He's giddy. SEE: Why cloud lock-in might actually be good for you Must-Read Cloud Microsoft offers free Windows 10 upgrades to certain customers Video: The hybrid cloud 'condition,' and what Amazon is doing to address it How Mark Shuttleworth became the first African in space and launched a software revolution (PDF download) Subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter One reason is innovation. As Expedia vice president of technology Subbu Allamaraju has argued, the public cloud providers are ground zero for innovation today. Developers who care about getting stuff done, and getting it done well, have no choice but to build on AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Another is simple expedience. Each CIO has spent decades trying to reinvent the IT wheel, with each building out many of the same functions and sharing little to none with peers. Open source was supposed to remedy this massively inefficient hoarding, but largely hasn't. The cloud providers, while closed, do offer a way for enterprises to get the best IT infrastructure (and SaaS) at a lower cost than it would take to roll out their own. Small wonder, then, that Under Armour vice president Jesse Demmel has said, "Going all-in on AWS for Connected Fitness has enabled us to optimize all of our apps." Rather than futzing down in the weeds of infrastructure, Under Armour can focus its resources on innovating its customer-facing apps. We should expect to see more of these "all-in with _____ [insert your cloud vendor of choice]" announcements, until they become so routine that no one pays attention anymore.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Security Courts in Contradiction: Microsoft Doesn’t Have to Comply, But Google Has to? By Rafia Shaikh Feb 6, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit A US judge has ordered Google to comply with search warrants seeking customer emails stored outside the United States, Reuters reported yesterday. The decision comes after Microsoft won a similar case when the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the Redmond software giant could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland. The intelligence officials in the country had sought Microsoft’s data in a drug trafficking case. Google to appeal the decision US Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled that Google must obey domestic search warrants and hand over data that is stored overseas. “Google regularly transfers user data from one data center to another without the customer’s knowledge. Such transfers do not interfere with the customer’s access or possessory interest in the user data. Even if the transfer interferes with the account owner’s control over his information, this interference is de minimis and temporary,” the judge wrote. He added that since the requested data will only be opened by the FBI inside the US, it wasn’t, according to him, a foreign search. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” the judge wrote. The decision puts the privacy of Google users who aren’t American citizens at risk. This means that Google will have to comply with the FBI’s incessant demands of suspect data regardless of where the data is held. The Mountain View search giant has previously refused to comply with two court orders, so it’s unlikely the company will follow the latest order without trying to appeal. Starting Tomorrow, FBI Will Be [Legally] Able to Go on a Mass Hacking Spree with One Single Warrant “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants,” Google spokesperson said. Advertisement The decision is also in stark contradiction with the Microsoft case, where a federal appeals court had reached to the conclusion that the company can’t be forced to hand over data stored overseas. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York voted last month not to revisit the decision made in favor of Microsoft in July last year. However, four judges in dissent called on the US supreme court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurts law enforcement. Both Microsoft and Google cases involve warrants issued under the US Stored Communications Act. The Act is a 31-year old law that many technology companies and privacy activists consider outdated. “We need Congress to modernize the law both to keep people safe and ensure that governments everywhere respect each other’s borders,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said last month. “This decision puts the focus where it belongs, on Congress passing a law for the future rather than litigation about an outdated statute from the past.” Microsoft had successfully argued that the US officials need to go to Irish authorities to request access to files stored on the Irish servers. Judge Susan Carney, who had voted to uphold July’s ruling in favor of Microsoft, said last month that “courts should be particularly solicitous of sovereignty concerns when authorizing data to be collected in the United States but drawn from within the boundaries of a foreign nation.” Court Upholds Warrantless Surveillance of US Citizens Under Section 702 Google has said that the company will appeal this ruling that it has to hand over the emails of Gmail users stored outside of the country. The company said that it complies with warrants it had received by handing over data the company knew was stored in the US. The search giant will likely be using Microsoft’s case in its defense.

Here’s the full text: “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY Google’s plan to take action on offending apps stands to affect millions of so-called “zombie apps” littering the Play Store. Others won’t have the motivation or the know-how to create the privacy policy — especially for poor-performers — and could see their app removed as part of a purge that’s undoubtedly coming. For some, though, the move is a welcome one. Jack Cooney of Nerd Agency — creator of the popular “Hip Hop Ninja!” app says: I think it’s fantastic, this will clear the Google Play store of so many junk and zombie apps that our games will find increased visibility on the store as the search terms will become much less cluttered. This will make it easier for people to be able to find our app’s like Hop Hop Ninja! with better keyword searches like ninja or Nerd Agency and find much more relevant results. (A previous pain point of developing for Android). He’s right. One of the most common gripes among Android developers — aside from segmentation issues — is that of a crowded marketplace that makes it difficult at times to find what you’re looking for. Google’s coming purge — as perhaps a welcome side effect to consumer privacy concerns that forced the issue — helps to clear the noise and help users find the signal, or the app, in this case. App developers have until March 15 to make the privacy policy addition, or Google warns “administrative action will be taken to limit the visibility of your app, up to and including removal from the Play Store.” Read next: French man sues Uber for $45M after privacy bug leads wife to suspect adultery GoogleGoogle PlayTech Share on Facebook (362) Share on Twitter (334) Bryan Clark is a reporter from San Diego, CA.

Brent VerWeyst, Google Cloud product manager, described the tool in a blog post as bringing the "best of Google Search and machine intelligence to G Suite". Cloud Search, which was previously dubbed Springboard, had been in limited review. Small banks' cyber threats Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank president Patrick Harker has said he is worried about cyber threats to small banks, pointing to hackers stealing money by exploiting third-party vendors that provide cyber security, Reuters reports.  The exec said small banks' main concern is cyber security, according to the report. Rometty's bonus IBM CEO Ginni Rometty has received a $4.95 million payout under her annual incentive plan, the largest since she was named to the top post 2012, Bloomberg reports, citing a company regulatory filing. The bonus was tied to goals for operating net income, operating cash flow and revenue from the company's strategic imperatives, the report said. Rometty received a $4.5 million bonus in 2015. Rometty's target for her bonus and her $1.6 million salary will remain unchanged in fiscal 2017, the filing said. She'll also receive equity awards worth about $13.3 million linked to company financial goals. Congress' privacy vote The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure requiring law enforcement to obtain a search warrant before seeking emails or other digital communications older than six months from technology companies, Reuters reports. Both Microsoft and Google have recently challenged the government's power to compel them to turn over emails stored on servers overseas, with the former winning its argument and the latter losing.  Technology companies have pressured Congress for years to pass the Email Privacy Act in order to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act from 1986. Under current law, federal agencies only need to procure a subpoena to request information from a service provider. Revel's exec shakeup Revel Systems, which has raised more than $130 million and deployed its software in thousands of iPad checkout terminals, has dismissed its two founders and been taken over by one of its major investors, the company has announced. Revel co-founder and CEO Lisa Falzone and co-founder and CTO Chris Ciabarra were bought out of most of their shares by private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, which now has a majority stake in the company, BuzzFeed reports.  Scott Betts, a former Procter & Gamble executive, has been installed as the new CEO. Cologix's Stonepeak deal Cologix, a network neutral interconnection and datacenter operator of 24 facilities in nine markets in North America, has announced that private equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners has acquired a majority interest in the company. Under terms of the deal, Grant van Rooyen, Cologix CEO and board chairman, will continue to run the company. Existing investors, including van Rooyen, the van Rooyen Group, company management, Columbia Capital and Greenspring Associates will retain a material interest in the company moving forward and will participate in future growth equity investments, Stonepeak said. Additional board members include Trent Vichie, Brian McMullen, Bill Fathers and Peter Bruce from Stonepeak, Patrick Hendy from Columbia and Neil Hobbs of the van Rooyen Group. CompTIA's digital transformation report IT industry trade association CompTIA is offering a new report, entitled Building Digital Organizations, covering the evolving digital transformation that is prompting companies to revise their operation procedures. The report spans new strategic roles of IT departments, new opportunities for IT teams and shared responsibilities among lines of business and IT.  Microsoft's patent trolls Microsoft has said it will make its storehouse of 10,000 patents available free of charge to safeguard cloud developers from potential legal threats mounted against them by patent trolls, Reuters reports. The company also said it will extend its offer to defend any customers sued over Azure to include open source technology incorporated into its cloud service. For example, Microsoft will defend an automaker lacking mobile apps and other cloud-based products, which could make it vulnerable to a lawsuit by a patent entity, the report said. "They haven't had years to build up that patent portfolio," Julia White, Microsoft corporate VP, reportedly told Reuters. "Cloud innovation is far too important to be stifled by lawsuits." CyrusOne's datacenter acquisitions Datacenter operator CyrusOne has announced plans to acquire two datacenters from enterprise datacenter operator and designer Sentinel Datacenters for $490 million. CyrusOne said it will buy a Sentinel datacenter located in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina and another in Somerset, New Jersey, in moves to boost its presence in the southeast U.S. and reach more customers in the healthcare and financial industries, the company said. With the acquisition, CyrusOne now operates 35 datacenter facilities, 33 of which are located in the U.S. Apple's TV exec Apple has hired Timothy Twerdahl, the former head of Amazon's Fire TV unit, to head its Apple TV product marketing, in a move that could signal the vendor's renewed focus on the platform, Bloomberg reports. Twerdahl will report to Greg Joswiak, an Apple VP in charge of iPhone marketing, the report said. Previous Apple TV marketing VP Pete Distad will now help lead Apple's content initiatives, the report said.

Now, it might be making its way back with Play store for Android apps. The Information reports that the search giant has been approached by Beijing-based online services and gaming firm NetEase to form a joint venture and launch Google Play in China. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY It’s worth noting that the companies haven’t reached an agreement yet, and that Google has been approached by other local companies in the past. The difficulty in entering China has a lot to do with securing governmental approval and navigating regulations concerning censorship and storing data locally. Google had reportedly geared up to launch a censored version of Google Play in China back in 2015, but nothing came of the effort; it’s possible that local laws made that a challenge. If a partnership were to emerge from the talks, Google would certainly have a lot to gain. Its entire range of services are blocked in China, which counts a whopping 479 million Android users across the country. Even if it’s only allowed to run its Play store there (and not offer search, email or other services), it could stand to grab a chunk of app sales and in-app purchases that are currently earned by local stores, including those operated by tech heavyweights like Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and Qihoo 360. For reference, App Annie forecasts that the Asia-Pacific region will account for annual gross revenues of $58 billion by 2020. That’s more than the rest of the world combined. The move would also signal a 180-degree turn for Google, which previously maintained that it wouldn’t bow to governmental pressure to censor content on its platforms. It’ll be interesting to see if NetEase can land the deal – but don’t hold your breath.

 Google just debuted one of the best-looking smartwatches we've ever seen Avery Hartmans Feb. 8, 2017, 12:00 PM 17,345 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google is doubling down on smartwatches. Hollis Johnson With the launch of Android Wear 2.0, the first major update to Google's smartwatch operating system in nearly three years, comes two new smartwatches to run the new OS created out of a partnership with LG. The new watches — the LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style — are simultaneously pared-down and beefed up, with a design to help facilitate Google's focus on on-watch messaging, fitness, and the addition of the Google Assistant. The watches go on sale February 10, retailing for $349 and $249, respectively. I tested the LG Watch Style, the slimmer, more stylish alternative to the Sport, a hulking gadget with its own SIM card and advanced fitness tracking capabilities. The Style, available at both Best Buy and the Google Store, is being marketed as a watch for "trendsetters," a device for daily use that can nearly pass as a standard timepiece. It's not yet the perfect smartwatch — if there is such a thing — but it's a clean, modern, and useful gadget that proves wearables may not be dead after all.  A fashion-conscious approach The LG Watch Style is billed as just that: a style-conscious watch designed to be as unobtrusive as possible.  The watch is thicker than a standard timepiece, but not overly so. In fact, I was impressed by the amount of computing power contained in a device that's less than a half-inch thick. The display is about 1.2 inches in diameter, which I was surprised to learn is actually smaller than the Daniel Wellington watch I wear every day.  The Style also comes in three different finishes — silver, titanium, and rose gold — and comes standard with an Italian leather band, although it can be easily swapped out if you prefer a rubberized band.  Compared to some of its predecessors — and particularly its companion watch, the Sport — the Style watch is stylish. It wasn't over-designed and Google clearly took into account the types of watches that are gaining popularity in the fashion world: an oversized face, only one side dial, and a variety of metal finishes, including rose gold. The launch of the Style watch appears to be an attempt to cater to both women and those who are wary of smartwatches in general. But it's actually from a fashion perspective where the Style watch had two shortcomings, though minor ones: I wasn't impressed by the plastic backing on it, and the Italian leather strap didn't look as high-end as what I'd expect from a $250 watch.   Still, I felt for the most part that the watch cleverly disguised itself as any other piece of jewelry, which is one major advantage it has over the Apple Watch. Men will likely be comfortable with the size and weight of it, while women will find its look more fashion-forward than other smartwatches on the market.  Hollis Johnson A well-rounded gadget Using the LG Watch Style is intuitive and uncomplicated. With the option to scroll by touch, with the dial, or by built-in gesture commands, Google doesn't put pressure on the user to use only the screen to navigate the watch. For the thick-fingered or farsighted, this is a huge plus.  One important difference between the LG Watch Style and its bigger sibling, the LG Watch Sport, is that it's designed to be an everyday watch that can carry you from the gym to work to a night out on the town. For those looking for a full-service fitness tracker, the Style watch is not it — but it's not intended to be. Google built in just enough of those features to make the Style watch a well-rounded gadget.  That said, two major limitations of the Style is the lack of a heart rate monitor and the fact it's not waterproof. It is water-resistant — it can hold up to a heavy soaking in a rain storm — but you can't go swimming with it like you can with the Apple Watch Series 2. (The Apple Watch Series 2 isn't waterproof either, but water-resistant up to 50 meters; the LG Watch Sport is a bit more water-resistant than the Style, as it can only last about 30 minutes in 1.5 meters of water.) Again, the LG Watch Style isn't a heavy-duty fitness-tracking watch. But those features would be nice to have and, frankly, almost expected at this point in the smartwatch game.    Conclusions Using the LG Watch Style was more enjoyable than most other smartwatches I've tried. It expertly straddles the line between staying true to the intention of a smartwatch — the "Always On" feature, which ensures your watch actually tells you the time, is key to that — while paying attention to trends in technology and thoughtfully implementing them on a small device. While it's not the most stylish watch I've ever worn, it is a definite improvement over its predecessors from an aesthetic standpoint. If the Style watch goes head to head with the LG Watch Sport, or even an Apple Watch 2, it's the obvious winner from both a comfort and fashion standpoint.  Still, the LG Watch Style isn't perfect — if there is such a thing — but it's the best smartwatch for most people: It's thin, it's lightweight, and it's aesthetically pleasing, but above all, it's subtle enough so that if you're wearing one, you won't seem like a gadget nerd.  SEE ALSO: Here’s what’s new in Android Wear 2.0, the latest smartwatch system from Google NOW WATCH: 6 things the iPhone can’t do that Android phones can Loading video...

 Here’s what’s new in Android Wear 2.0, the latest smartwatch system from Google Avery Hartmans Feb. 8, 2017, 12:00 PM 4,126 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson It's been nearly three years since Google's smartwatch operating system, Android Wear, got a major update.  Since then, Apple has launched its own watch twice over and Fitbit still makes the best fitness trackers you can buy. Android Wear's production partners, like Motorola, have put plans to make more smartwatches on hold.  This makes the launch of Android Wear 2.0 and the introduction of two new smartwatches (in partnership with LG) a telling signal of Google's commitment to wearables. I used Android Wear 2.0 on one of Google's new smartwatches, the LG Watch Style (more on the watch itself here) to test out the flagship features of the new operating system: on-watch apps, fitness, and a built-in Google Assistant.  On-watch apps One of the most exciting features of Android Wear 2.0 is having the Play Store on a smartwatch. As long as the watch has a cellular connection, you can use apps on the watch and even make calls, regardless of whether your phone is in your pocket or at home. Being able to directly download apps onto the watch and cut out the middleman — your phone — makes using the watch a more fluid experience.  The apps themselves are simplified versions of what's on the phone, a trend that also caught on with Apple Watch Series 2. Rather than squinting at the screen and trying to navigate through a complex app on a tiny screen, the on-watch apps are pared down and provide only the functionality you need. And with the addition of a full keyboard to the watch, you have three options for responding to messages or using apps: typing things out on a standard keyboard, voice search and input, and drawing emoji.  Hollis Johnson The experience isn't perfect yet, but mostly because third-party apps haven't caught up. Some Android Wear apps still require a phone to either set things up or do more minute computing, like typing out a shopping list. But apps' capabilities should only improve over time.  Where the on-watch apps are most important is in the fitness realm. The addition of Google Play Music to the on-watch Play Store means your phone can be left at home during a workout and you can rely solely on the watch for music. There's one major limitation to that — it means you need wireless headphones — but it's a sign that Google is paying attention to the future of fitness technology and the gradual shift away from wired headphones.  Improved fitness tracking Fitness tracking was clearly top of mind for Google in creating the new operating system and building the new watches. I got to try these features when I reviewed the LG Watch Style, one of the two LG-made smartwatches launching alongside Android Wear 2.0. While the Style doesn't have as many fitness-focused features as its bigger, tougher sibling, the LG Watch Sport (read my colleague Steve Kovach's review of that here), it still works as a basic fitness tracker. The new version of Android Wear on the LG Watch Style does count steps and allows you to set goals for yourself, like running twice a week. Its best feature, however, is the ability to count the number of reps for various activities and act as a fitness coach. With the on-watch Fit Workout app, you can track activities like stationary biking or aerobics, as well as try three types of 30-day challenges: push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. While I was originally skeptical that the watch could accurately track the number reps, its built-in gyroscope was able to track both sit-ups and push-ups I completed with perfect accuracy. The watch also coaches you on proper form for each workout, running through a demo of how to complete the move safely and correctly. It tracks your progress each day and makes it a little bit tougher each time you complete the challenge. Hollis Johnson A simplified user experience overall In Android Wear 2.0, Google lets you to keep your watch face as simple and uncluttered or as customized as you'd like. With personalized watch faces, you can add bubbles that show upcoming agenda items, your fitness goals, or add app shortcuts. Choosing the right watch face was one of the more challenging parts of using the device, as there's only so much information you want displayed on the face of your watch.  Google Assistant is also now built into the watch, which, on the LG Watch Style, is activated by holding down the side button. Google Assistant is nice to have, as it quickly navigates to apps and saves a few clicks of the dial, but is somewhat unnecessary on a small device that only holds 4 GB worth of apps.  For those still using watches that run older versions of Android Wear, many of those will also support the new Android Wear 2.0 operating system. Google says 2.0 will roll out to the following watches over the coming months: ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Casio PRO TREK Smart, Fossil Q Founder, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Wander, Huawei Watch, LG Watch R, LG Watch Urbane and 2nd Edition LTE, Michael Kors Access Smartwatches, Moto 360 2nd Gen, Moto 360 for Women, Moto 360 Sport, New Balance RunIQ, Nixon Mission, Polar M600, and TAG Heuer Connected. Conclusion Overall, Android Wear 2.0 provided the best user experience I've ever had with a smartwatch. It's intuitive and modern, with an interface that's both aesthetically-pleasing and functional. The apps load quickly, the battery lasts for more than a full day, and the watch faces are almost infinitely changeable and customizable. The streamlined operating system makes using a smartwatch more convenient than previous versions. In fact, it felt as though Google re-envisioned the new operating system as a companion to a phone rather than a full-fledged computer. At the same time, since the new operating system is capable of messaging and on-watch music, you can leave your phone at home and rely solely on the watch for your basic needs.  The new Android Wear provides everything you need and nothing you don't, and can best be described as a smart, unfussy approach to building a smartwatch. Still, it's tough to tell whether or not Android Wear will help smartwatches in general cross over from "nice to have" to "must have."

Updated February 8, 2017 10:53AM SHARE ALSO SEE Cloud Computing Microsoft Data Storage Azure Amazon AWS Copyright Microsoft is expanding a program to defend customers of its cloud-computing services from copyright lawsuits filed by patent trolls and other companies. Microsoft's customer agreements already included a pledge from the Redmond company to defend users of its Azure cloud-computing platform in cases in which third parties claim that the use of Microsoft's software infringed on their patents. That plan will expand to cover the open-source software sold on Azure, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith [pictured here] said in a blog post Wednesday. The company will also offer customers who are sued for use of Azure the aid of 10,000 Microsoft patents in their defense, Smith said. Microsoft is eager to differentiate itself from its larger rival in the cloud world, Amazon.com, by bolstering its promises to secure customers' data and defend them from legal complications. Cloud-computing, the fast growing business of selling on-demand computing power and data storage, is increasingly a target of patent trolls -- companies that hoard patents for the purpose of lucrative intellectual property lawsuits -- Microsoft says. Smith in a blog post Wednesday cited a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study showing that companies that purchase patents without the intent to develop them are increasingly buying cloud-computing patents. Intellectual property lawsuits relating to the cloud are up 22 percent in the last five years in the U.S., the company said, citing BCG. Microsoft decided to expand its indemnification policy following cases in which financial institutions asked Microsoft for help defending against patent lawsuits related to work on Azure, the company says. © 2017 Seattle Times syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Updated February 10, 2017. Businesses often set up virtual private networks, or VPNs, to protect against IT threats that can be introduced via remote workers using cloud services to access corporate data. Because employees don't always use those VPNs, though, Cisco has launched a new layer of protection: a secure Internet gateway (SIG) dubbed Umbrella. Calling it "the industry's first secure Internet gateway in the cloud," Cisco said yesterday that Umbrella is designed to provide enterprise users with a safe way to access cloud services from anywhere via any device. And because Umbrella is a cloud-based service, it's fast and easy for customers to deploy without the need for new hardware or software, according to Cisco. Built on the OpenDNS platform, Umbrella incorporates other Cisco technologies such as Cloud Web Security and Advanced Malware Protection. Those integrations enable the gateway service to inspect files before they're downloaded from potentially risky domains, and also adds new predictive intelligence capabilities to avoid other potential threats. 'Secure Onramp to the Internet' "Before you connect to any destination, a SIG acts as your secure onramp to the Internet and provides the first line of defense and inspection," Kevin Rollinson, product marketing manager for Cisco OpenDNS, wrote yesterday in a blog post. "Regardless of where users are located or what they're trying to connect to, traffic goes through the SIG first. Once the traffic gets to the SIG cloud platform, there are different types of inspection and policy enforcement that can happen." As a secure Internet gateway, Umbrella offers advantages over other protection strategies such as secure Web gateways, or SWGs, added Brian Roddy, who heads cloud security for Cisco. SWGs can be hard to deploy and "constantly create problems around latency and capacity," he said. By contrast, Umbrella was developed to reimagine how security is delivered, he added. "For us, it wasn't about taking the old technology and just sticking it into the cloud," Roddy said. "We wanted to create a new layer of defense -- protecting users whether they're on and off the corporate network. We want it to be easy to deploy, be highly effective, minimize latency, support world-wide installations and support the open architectures that have made SaaS so effective." Umbrella 'Detects Anomalies' To Predict Threats While software-as-a-service tools such as Salesforce, Box, Google's G Suite, Office 365, WebEx, Trello and others, are widely used today, professionals who access those services from remote locations or mobile devices don't always use them via secure connections such as VPNs. In a survey conducted on behalf of Cisco last year, IDG Research Services found that 82 percent of the corporate laptop users it questioned admitted to sometimes bypassing their organizations' VPNs. "Much of this off-network usage was for personal activities, but nearly 30 percent of the end users said they sometimes access company data without logging into their VPNs," according to IDG. Unlike a VPN, Umbrella uses a customer's existing Cisco hardware, such as AnyConnect clients, routers or wireless LAN controllers, to "easily point Internet traffic to Umbrella whether on or off the corporate network," the company said. Umbrella "resolves over 100 billion Internet requests every day and correlates this live data with over 11 billion historical events," according to Cisco. "This is analyzed to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and create models to automatically uncover attacker infrastructure being staged for the next threat." Cisco did not provide pricing for Umbrella, but the company is offering a free 14-day trial to each customer who signs up for the service.

The SPV was registered in March, and has seven stakeholders and 15 directors. The latest contract is valued at Rs 150 crore, and includes capital expenditure, operating expenditure and revenue sharing elements, Pune Municipal Commissioner Kunal Kumar told ET. “The work order was given on January 6 this year…15-20% revenue generated through this city-wide Wi-Fi network will be shared with the authority,” he said. Under the contract, Google will help monetize the city Wi-Fi network, and will deploy Google Station platform, which has WiFi network management capability, and focuses on monetisation to make WiFi self-sustainable. RailTel, on the other hand, will provide lat-mile fiber connectivity on need basis to enable Wi-Fi hotspots at around 200 strategic locations across the city. “The plan is to integrate all public places on a single platform to aggregate Wi-Fi hotspots that will allow access with one time authentication,” Kumar added. With Google Station platform, the company is extending its Wi-Fi service beyond railway stations to places that frequented by a large number of people, such as malls and transit stations, and in social hangout locations such as cafes and universities. It previously said to be partnering with large venues and organizations, network operators, fiber providers, system integrators and infrastructure companies to provide Wi-Fi in city areas. Google has been working with RailTel and Indian Railways to provide high-speed Wi-Fi at 400 railway stations throughout the country. So far, over 100 railway stations have been equipped with Wi-Fi hotspots. Besides Wi-Fi, Google is also working with RailTel and L&T for variable message displays (VMD) that will be used to deliver important information and messages across 161 locations in the city. “One of the important things that we are doing is WiFi, and then we are also establishing the emergency call box and public drop box and environmental sensors…We are working with RailTel for connectivity and Google for putting advertisements. Google will help us in monetization through advertisements,” Srinivasan Ramamurthy, Lead -Smart World And Communication Business - Larsen & Toubro, told ET. L&T is the master system integrator for the Pune Smart City project and it will help integrate everything together, Sharma said, adding that the company will also set up emergency call boxes and public address systems, environmental sensors, variable messaging displays, network connectivity and video analytics integration. Under the deal, IBM is providing its smart city solutions that will work as the backbone of the Pune smart city. IBM is also helping L&T set up a Smart City Operation Centre (SCOC) to integrate all the services and applications on a single platform, which will be able to accommodate all future needs through integration of various citizen-centric applications. It will integrate 49 applications. Google and IBM didn’t comment on ET queries on the contract. 2017: Know about HR hurdles of the telecom industry Newsletter A A         Tags : Internet, WiFi, smart city, raitel, Pune, L&T, Google WiFi, Google  Comment on this Recommended by Colombia Sponsored Stories Subscribe ETTelecom Newsletter 200000+ Industry Leaders already read it everyday Most Read This Week This Month Good news for Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio!

President Trump. (BigStock Photo) Tech giants, like Amazon, Expedia, Google, and Microsoft, have thrown their considerable weight behind Washington state and Minnesota in a lawsuit challenging President Trump’s executive immigration order. But smaller players have just as much to lose under anti-immigration policies — and now some of them are stepping into the ring. Fifteen startups have added their names to an amicus brief, signed by more than 100 technology companies and other businesses. The original brief backs the states’ case, detailing how the executive order negatively impacts employees and business operations. The supplemental startup brief also describes the important role immigrants play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem: Start-up companies contribute substantially to this country’s economic prosperity and growth potential and for reasons similar to those already set forth by the Technology Companies in their Amici Brief, start-ups are especially affected by the immigration order at issue. Many start-up companies are founded by, and rely heavily on the hard work of immigrants. Orders of the type at issue here cause immediate harm to technology companies, their employees and their families, and the competitiveness of the United States in the global market for innovation. In many instances, the technological innovation driven by U.S. start-ups contributes not only to the national prosperity but also to the national security. Implementation of the immigration order at issue thus has the potential to harm the country’s security as well as its prosperity. As of last year, more than half of U.S. startups valued at  $1 billion or more were founded by immigrant entrepreneurs, according to a study cited in an open letter The National Venture Capital Association sent to President Trump yesterday. The letter, signed by more than 100 investors and entrepreneurs, implores the president to reconsider his existing executive order, which temporarily blocks citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. and suspends refugee immigration indefinitely. “While we recognize the importance of promoting national security and protecting the interests of American workers, we strongly believe that the existing and proposed Executive Orders will not accomplish these goals and in fact, could undermine our ability to found and grow new companies that create jobs here in the U.S.,” the letter says. “We urge you to reconsider these actions and their impact not only on American values, but also on America’s economic future.” The NVCA letter also expresses concerns over a draft of another executive order, originally obtained by Bloomberg News. The draft pledges to overhaul the H1-B visa program, which allows skilled, graduate-level immigrants to work for employers in the U.S. Big tech companies, like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, rely heavily on the H-1B visa to recruit talent. Lending Robot CEO Emmanuel Marot. (Lending Robot Photo) “Preventing immigrants to work in the U.S. will entice employers, including large U.S. corporations, to open shops elsewhere,” said Emmanuel Marot — an immigrant himself and the founder of Lending Robot, a signatory of the startup amicus brief. “I remember Microsoft opening engineering offices in Vancouver, B.C. because of immigration limits in the U.S. Google, Amazon, and Apple will setup engineering offices in other countries, where they will be able to onboard as many Russian, Iranian or Chinese they want. Not only does it not bring jobs to the U.S., but the economic growth around those hires is also going away.” The leaked order also reveals the Trump administration’s plans to kill the “International Entrepreneur Rule,” that President Obama pushed through after Congress failed to create a “startup visa” to encourage foreign entrepreneurs to grow companies in the U.S. Henry Chen. “The startup parole is not against President Trump’s interest to protect domestic workers,” said Henry Chen, a startup founder from China who was considering the Entrepreneur Rule as a way to return the states; Chen graduated from the University of Missouri in 2015. “International Entrepreneurs won’t compete with domestic American workers, instead, we have great potentials to create more job opportunities and boost American economy. I hope President Trump, used to be an Entrepreneur himself, would not shut this door and revoke the rule.” It’s unclear when the draft executive order will be implemented. Meanwhile, the legal battle over Trump’s travel ban is escalating quickly. Yesterday, a panel of judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals grilled representatives of Washington state and President Trump over a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by a federal Judge in Seattle Friday. The TRO immediately halted implementation of Trump’s immigration ban until its legality could be tested in court. The Department of Justice claims the president was well within his authority to suspend immigration of aliens deemed to be a national security threat. The Trump administration says the temporary halt is necessary to study immigration procedures and defend the country against threats of terrorism. President Trump used his favorite platform to express frustration with the legal challenges to his immigration order. If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 The Ninth Circut judges will likely decide whether the travel ban will be reinstated by the end of the week. The high-profile case is expected to rise to the Supreme Court. Washington and Minnesota have been steadily amassing support from other states and members of the business world but this latest brief is the first explicit declaration of support from the startup community. “I don’t think U.S., has an immigration problem, because of the fact that it is a country of immigrants (Donald J. is not exactly Native American) proves that immigrations worked, historically,” said Marot.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google’s Waze expands carpooling to whole Bay Area By Ethan Baron / February 8, 2017 at 9:50 AM Bay Area commuters don’t have to suffer alone — they can get stuck in the region’s abysmal traffic in the company of other folks, and play a small role in reducing congestion horrors. After a pilot project launched last year, Google’s traffic and navigation app firm Waze has just opened up its smartphone-based carpooling service in all nine Bay Area counties, along with the area from Sacramento to Monterey. The move gives commuters another transportation option, and gives Google a platform from which to go after Uber and Lyft, whose UberPool and Lyft Line services allow users to travel in ride-hailing cars together. For Waze Carpool, commuters are matched by their pick-up and drop-off locations, and only two people are pooled together, according to Waze. The service can’t be used in the manner of a typical ride-hailing app: only two rides per day are permitted, to and from work. Drivers receive ride requests from people traveling the same route, and those paired up share fuel cost. Waze suggests a payment rate, which is capped at 54 cents per mile. Money is transferred automatically from drivers to riders. Waze has entered into a partnership with the Bay Area’s Metropolitan Transportation Commission, UC San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente, to encourage use of the carpooling service to cut traffic. While new Waze Carpool users get two free rides, employees of the university and Kaiser get three. “It’s a tool that can help improve mobility and reduce congestion throughout the region,” MTC executive director Steve Heminger said in a statement.   Photo: Traffic stacks up on Almaden Expressway (Karen T.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jennifer Rubin By Jennifer Rubin February 8 Follow @JRubinBlogger Apple chief executive Tim Cook at the Apple event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco in Sept. 2015. (Eric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS/File) On a day the president and vice president are again meeting with high-tech industry leaders, it’s important to recognize how much more active in the public policy debate Silicon Valley has become. “For years, many tech companies tried to ignore Washington. Microsoft in Seattle, Apple and Google in Silicon Valley, went about their business, developing products, selling them to customers, and — happily, legally — making money,” David Boaz of the Cato Institute wrote recently. “But it seems that every successful company eventually finds out that it can’t just work on improving its products and serving consumers. Sooner or later, it’s going to have to deal with politicians and regulators sniffing around its business.” The explanation lies in the necessity of political activism in the Trump era. Remember when conservatives (a few months ago, say) used to argue that big, intrusive government made business into rent-seekers, needing this and that adjustment in order to survive? Well high-tech’s need to engage with Washington, D.C., proves the point, and lays bare Trump’s anti-competitive agenda. “When the federal government restricts trade, limits companies’ ability to hire the best employees and levies the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, it hurts US companies’ growth,” Boaz notes. “When it also launches antitrust investigations of successful companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple, companies feel they have no choice but to get involved in politics and lobbying. And that’s a shame, because the most important factor in America’s economic future — raising everyone’s standard of living — is not land, or money, or computers; it’s human talent.” Apple, Google, Twitter and Microsoft are among nearly 100 tech companies who filed a legal brief opposing President Trump's immigration ban. The brief says Trump's executive order represents a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the U.S. and inflicts harm on American companies. (Reuters) In other words, at a time Trump is promising to “deregulate” (2 regulations go away for every new one) he is engaged in two massive regulatory efforts which threaten our most promising industries. Trade protectionism is in fact an especially intrusion form of regulation insofar as it penalizes companies for making economically smart decisions on everything from which supplier to use to where distribution and manufacturing plants should be located. Likewise, telling companies they cannot hire the best, most talented employees if they happen to come from certain countries is far more intrusive than, say, raising the minimum wage, something Republicans staunchly oppose. The other threat to industries (including high-tech) that pride themselves on being meritocracies is that Trump’s erratic, personalized style of business, replete with conflicts of interest, gives preference to competitors that may have chummier relations with Trump — or his children — rather than the best products or most attractive prices. Chief executives around the country must have shuddered to hear Trump excoriate a company for deciding not to do business with his daughter. He tweeted: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible.” Now, Nordstrom’s shoppers may not include a lot of working-class Trump fans from the Rust Belt but the message is not lost on American business: Don’t think about ending (or refusing to initiate) business with my children or you, too, will feel my wrath. This conduct has a corrosive effect on business ethics and penalizes companies that have no means or desire to fatten the Trump family coffers. When you hear that the Department of Defense is contemplating renting space in Trump Tower (at elevated rates, perhaps?) you see one more instance in which the price of business, quite literally, is tied to doing business with the Trump family. With regard to business leasing space either to (e.g., the Trump hotel) or from Trump, every day brings new questions about whether Trump is getting rich off the government and whether businesses not associated with Trump are at a competitive disadvantage. Jordan Libowitz of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington tells me, “These questions are just another issue raising from Trump’s refusal to divest from his business and put his assets in a blind trust. There shouldn’t have to be questions pitting national security against personal enrichment. This is completely unprecedented.” If high-tech executives have a single message for Trump it should be this: America wins when it can operate smartly, with the best talent and in the most efficient ways possible. Protectionism, immigration exclusion and cronyism (verging on out-and-out corruption) destroy American competitiveness and in turn American jobs. That kind of message in defense of free markets, which used to come from Republicans before Trump took over their party and their souls, would serve not only their own industry, but virtually all American businesses and the workers they employ. opinions right-turn Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Android Wear 2.0 is a major update to Google’s wearables platform. With it, you can personalize your watch face with information from apps that you choose, letting you quickly glance at info like the weather, your fitness tracking, and more. Speaking of fitness, Google Fit will let you track your pace, distance, calories burned, and heart rate (on supported devices) when you walk, run, or cycle. Google Fit can also track your reps when you’re weight-lifting as well as when you’re doing push-ups, sit-ups, or squats. Another big feature of Android Wear 2.0 is the new on-watch Google Play Store. You can use this to browse for and install apps directly on your watch, meaning that you don’t need to pull out your phone and try to figure out if an app will work on your smartwatch. Google has included new messaging features in Android Wear 2.0 as well. When you receive a message, you can dictate, type, or handwrite your response, or you can even draw an emoji. If you’re in a hurry, you can use Smart Reply, a feature that’ll intelligently suggest responses based on the message you received. Finally, Android Wear 2.0 includes Google Assistant. You can launch Google’s Assistant by holding down the power button on your watch or by saying “Ok, Google.” From there, you can ask questions about the weather, sports scores, get directions, and more. Google Assistant on Android Wear 2.0 will launch with support for English and German. It’ll expand to more languages in the coming months. So when can you get Android Wear 2.0? Google says that an update will begin rolling out to existing smartwatches in the coming weeks. There are the Android Wear watches that’ll receive an update to Android Wear 2.0: ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3 Casio Smart Outdoor Watch Casio PRO TREK Smart Fossil Q Founder Fossil Q Marshal Fossil Q Wander Huawei Watch LG Watch R LG Watch Urbane & 2nd Edition LTE Michael Kors Access Smartwatches Moto 360 2nd Gen Moto 360 for Women Moto 360 Sport New Balance RunIQ Nixon Mission Polar M600 TAG Heuer Connected Source:  Google Android Android Wear Wearables Google Previous ArticleVerizon Wear24 is a carrier-exclusive Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch Next ArticleLG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style official, launching in the US on February 10 Don't forget to VOTE!

Google today officially took the wraps off of the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, its new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches that were made in collaboration with LG. The LG Watch Sport is the larger and higher-end of the two watches, boasting a 1.38-inch POLED 480x480 display. Inside the LG Watch Sport’s body is 4GB of storage, 768MB of RAM, and a Snapdragon 2100 processor. Google and LG have thrown in NFC for Android Pay as well as a heart rate monitor, GPS for tracking your workouts, and built-in 4G LTE connectivity that’ll enable it to work on AT&T and Verizon. There’s a 430mAh battery powering the whole package, and on the side of the watch there’s a rotating crown for navigating the Android Wear software as well as dedicated buttons for launching Android Pay and Google Fit. And then there’s the LG Watch Style. This smaller watch runs Android Wear 2.0 on a 1.2-inch 360x360 POLED screen, and its got slightly less RAM (512MB) and a slightly smaller battery (240mAh). The Watch Style also lacks the NFC, GPS, and LTE support found on the Watch Style, meaning there’s no Android Pay here. The LG Watch Style does include 4GB of built-in storage like its bigger LG Watch Sport sibling, as well as a Snapdragon 2100 processor. There’s also a rotating crown on the side of the watch, but there aren’t any dedicated buttons for launching apps like those found on the Watch Sport. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style will both launch in the US on February 10. You’ll be able to get the Watch Sport from AT&T, Verizon, and the Google Store, with pricing set at $349. If you decide to buy the LG Watch Sport from a carrier, AT&T will sell you the LG Watch Sport for $17.50 per month for 20 months on an AT&T installment plan, or $49.99 when purchased with an LG G5 or LG V20. Meanwhile, Verizon will charge $329.99 with a two-year contract or $379.99 full retail. The LG Watch Style will be available from Best Buy and the Google Store with a starting price of $249. When it comes to launches outside of the US, Google says that the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style will be available in Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, UAE and the UK in the coming weeks.

On Wednesday, it announced that the lion's share of the work is done, save for some last user attachments. The company signed up to work with Google, and as part of the migration process, the tech titan sent a team of engineers (in one case, bearing doughnuts) over to work with Evernote to make sure the process was a success. Evernote wanted to take advantage of the cloud to help with features based on machine learning that it has been developing. It also wanted to leverage the flexibility that comes from not having to run a data center. The move is part of a broader trend of companies moving their workloads away from data centers that they own and increasingly using public cloud providers. While the transition required plenty of work and adaptation, Evernote credited Google for pitching in to help with the migration. Why move to the cloud? There was definitely plenty of work to do. Evernote’s back-end was built on the assumption that its application would be running in the company’s twin California data centers, not in a public cloud. So why go through all the work? Many of the key drivers behind the move will be familiar to cloud devotees. Evernote employees had to spend time maintaining the company’s data center, doing things like replacing hard drives, moving cables and evaluating new infrastructure options. While those functions were key to maintaining the overall health and performance of the Evernote service, they weren’t providing additional value to customers, according to Ben McCormack, the company’s vice president of operations. “We were just very realistic that with a team the size of Evernote’s operations team, we couldn’t compete with the level of maturity that the cloud providers have got . . . on provisioning, on management systems, et cetera,” McCormack said.“ We were always going to be playing catch-up, and it’s just a crazy situation to be in.” [ Further reading: Where giant companies are in their cloud journeys ] When Evernote employees thought about refreshing a data center, one of the key issues that they encountered is that they didn’t know what they would need from a data center in five years, McCormack said. Evernote had several public cloud providers it could choose from, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which are both larger players in the public cloud market. But McCormack said the similarities between the company’s current focus and Google’s areas of expertise were important to the choice. Evernote houses a large amount of unstructured data, and the company is looking to do more with machine learning. “You add those two together, Google is the leader in that space,” McCormack said. “So effectively, I would say, we were making a strategic decision and a strategic bet that the areas that are important to Evernote today, and the areas we think will be important in the future, are the same areas that Google excels in.” Machine learning was a highlight of Google’s platform for Evernote CTO Anirban Kundu, who said that higher-level services offered by Google help provide the foundation for new and improved features. Evernote has been driving toward a set of new capabilities based on machine learning, and Google services like its Cloud Machine Learning API help with that. While cost is often touted as a benefit of cloud migrations, McCormack said that it wasn’t a primary driver of Evernote’s migration. While the company will be getting some savings out of the move, he said that cost wasn’t a limitation for the transition. The decision to go with Google over another provider like AWS or Azure was driven by the technology team at Evernote, according to Greg Chiemingo, the company’s senior director of communications. He said in an email that CEO Chris O’Neill, who was at Google for roughly a decade before joining Evernote, came in to help with negotiations after the decision was made. How it happened Once Evernote signed its contract with Google in October, the clock was ticking. McCormack said that the company wanted to get the migration done before the new year, when users looking to get their life on track hammer the service with a flurry of activity. Before the start of the year, Evernote needed to migrate 5 billion notes and 5 billion attachments. Because of metadata included with those attachments -- like thumbnail images -- McCormack said that the company had to migrate 12 billion attachment files. Not only that, but the team couldn’t lose any of the roughly 3 petabytes of data it had. And the Evernote service needed to stay up the entire time. McCormack said that one of the Evernote team’s initial considerations was figuring out what core parts of its application could be entirely lifted and shifted into Google’s cloud, and what components would need to be modified in some way as part of the transition. Part of the transformation involved reworking the way that the Evernote service handled networking. It previously used UDP Multicast to handle part of its image recognition workflow, which worked well in the company’s own data center where it could control the network routers involved. But that same technology wasn’t available in Google’s cloud. Kundu said Evernote had to rework its application to use a queue-based model leveraging Google’s Cloud Pub/Sub service, instead. Evernote couldn’t just migrate all of its user data over and then flip a switch directing traffic from its on-premises servers to Google’s cloud in one fell swoop. Instead, the company had to rearchitect its back-end application to handle a staged migration with some data stored in different places. The good news is that the transition didn’t require changes to the client. Kundu said that was key to the success of Evernote’s migration, because not all of the service’s users upgrade their software in a timely manner. Evernote’s engagement with Google engineers was a pleasant surprise to McCormack. The team was available 24/7 to handle Evernote’s concerns remotely, and Google also sent a team of its engineers over to Evernote’s facilities to help with the migration. Those Google employees were around to help troubleshoot any technical challenges Evernote was having with the move. That sort of engineer-to-engineer engagement is something Google says is a big part of its approach to service. For one particularly important part of the migration, Google’s engineers came in on a Sunday, bearing doughnuts for all in attendance. More than that, however, McCormack said that he was impressed with the engineers’ collaborative spirit. “We had times when . . .we had written code to interface with Google Cloud Storage, we had [Google] engineers who were peer-reviewing that code, giving feedback and it genuinely felt like a partnership, which you very rarely see,” McCormack said. “Google wanted to see us be successful, and were willing to help across the boundaries to help us get there.” In the end, it took roughly 70 days for the whole migration to take place -- from the signing of the contract to its final completion. The main part of the migration took place over the course of roughly 10 days in December, according to McCormack. Lessons learned If there was one thing Kundu and McCormack were crystal clear about, it’s that even the best-laid plans require a team that’s willing to adapt on the fly to a new environment. Evernote’s migration was a process of taking certain steps, evaluating what happened, and modifying the company’s approach in response to the situation they were presented with, even after doing extensive testing and simulation. Furthermore, they also pointed out that work on a migration doesn’t stop once all the bytes are loaded into the cloud. Even with extensive testing, the Evernote team encountered new constraints working in Google’s environment once it was being used in production and bombarded with activity from live Evernote users. For example, Google uses live migration techniques to move virtual machines from one host to another in order to apply patches and work around hardware issues. While that happens incredibly quickly, the Evernote service under full load had some problems with it, which required (and still requires) optimization. Kundu said that Evernote had tested live migration prior to making the switch over to GCP, but that wasn’t enough. When an application is put into production, user behavior and load on it might be different from test conditions, Kundu said. “And that’s where you have to be ready to handle those edge cases, and you have to realize that the day the migration happens or completes is not the day that you’re all done with the effort. You might see the problem in a month or whatever.” Another key lesson, in McCormack’s opinion, is that the cloud is ready to handle any sort of workload. Evernote evaluated a migration roughly once every year, and it was only about 13 months ago that the company felt confident a cloud transition would be successful. “Cloud has reached a maturity level and a breadth of features that means it’s unlikely that you’ll be unable to run in the cloud,” McCormack said. That’s not to say it doesn’t require effort. While the cloud does provide benefits to Evernote that the company wasn’t going to get from running its own data center, they still had to cede control of their environment, and be willing to lose some of the telemetry they’re used to getting from a private data center. Evernote’s engineers also did a lot of work on automating the transition. Moving users’ attachments over from the service’s on-premises infrastructure to Google Cloud Storage is handled by a pair of bespoke automated systems. The company used Puppet and Ansible for migrating the hundreds of shards holding user note data. The immediate benefits of a migration One of the key advantages of Evernote’s move to Google’s cloud is the company’s ability to provide reduced latency and improved connection consistency to its international customers. Evernote’s backend isn’t running in a geographically distributed manner right now, but Google’s worldwide networking investments provide an improvement right away. “We have seen page loading times reducing quite significantly across some parts of our application,” McCormack said. “I wouldn’t say it’s everywhere yet, but we are starting to see that benefit of the Google power and the Google reach in terms of bridging traffic over their global fiber network.” Right now, the company is still in the process of migrating the last of its users’ attachments to GCP. When that’s done, however, the company will be able to tell its users that all the data they have in the service is encrypted at rest, thanks to the capabilities of Google’s cloud. From an Evernote standpoint, the company’s engineers have increased freedom to get their work done using cloud services. Rather than having to deal with provisioning physical infrastructure to power new features, developers now have a whole menu of options when it comes to using new services for developing features. In addition, the cloud provides the company with additional flexibility and peace of mind when it comes to backups, outages and failover. What comes next? Looking further out, the company is interested in taking advantage of some of Google’s existing and forthcoming services. Evernote is investigating how it can use Google Cloud Functions, which lets developers write snippets of code that then run in response to event triggers. Evernote is also alpha testing some Google Cloud Platform services that haven’t been released or revealed to the public yet. Kundu wouldn’t provide any details about those services. In a similar vein, Evernote's Kundu wouldn’t go into details about future Evernote functionality yet. However, he said that there are “a couple” of new features that have been enabled as a result of the migration.

SUBSCRIBE Pinterest’s Lens app turns your phone’s camera into a search bar Pinterest's version of Google's Goggles will roll out to iPhone and Android users in the US sometime soon. Tim Peterson on February 8, 2017 at 1:46 pm More Pinterest is bringing search to the real world. On Wednesday, the social-network-slash-search-engine introduced Lens, a mobile app that uses the phone’s camera to recognize physical objects and pull up related items from Pinterest. The app appears to be Pinterest’s version of Google’s neglected Goggles app. Google’s app is no longer available in Apple’s App Store; it is still available on Android but hasn’t been updated since May 2014. Bing also has the feature built into its app, added last year. Based on some GIFs provided by Pinterest, Lens focuses on objects appearing within a circular window — likely to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio — and then presents tags that it associates with the object(s) as well as relevant pins from its platform. Pinterest had teased the product in June 2016 when it announced enhancements to its visual search tool. Pinterest’s Lens app is still in testing but will be available to iPhone and Android owners in the US sometime soon. While Pinterest claims the company’s technology is able to recognize more than 1 billion objects, for now, Lens “works best for finding home decor ideas, things to wear and food to eat,” according to a company blog post. As Lens extends Pinterest’s search chops to the real world, the company is also extending search beyond the query bar on its own platform. Pinterest’s new Shop the Look feature turns items appearing in pins into products people can buy. Relevant products will be highlighted with a blue circle that people can tap to see related products that are available for purchase, either on Pinterest or through a brand’s own site. CB2, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, Target and Wayfair are among the first brands to market their wares this way on Pinterest; Pinterest is sourcing their products through Curalate, Olapic, Project September, Refinery29 and ShopStyle. Pinterest’s Shop the Look feature is similar to a test Instagram began last year. Another new feature called Instant Ideas will append a white circle to pins in people’s home feeds that, when tapped, will insert related pins into the feed.

Here Are All the Smartwatches Getting Android Wear 2.0 Updates GO The new OS will be rolled out to compatible devices soon Feb 8, 2017 18:57 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Now that Google has taken the wraps off the new Android Wear 2.0 platform, let's take a look at the smartwatches that have already been confirmed to be updated to the new version of the OS. However, before going into details, it's worth mentioning that Android Wear 2.0 will not be available to all compatible wearable devices at the same time. Each manufacturer will roll out updates to their smartwatches as soon as they can. According to Google, Android Wear 2.0 will be available for all supported watches in the coming weeks, so that's the closest to a release date that we've got. The list of compatible Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches contains many Huawei, LG and Motorola products, but some pretty expensive devices made it to the list as well, which shows great customer care from companies that are less known for their experience in the smartwatch industry. On the other hand, the smartwatch market is relatively young, so the experience gap between these companies is almost insignificant. Without any further ado, let's plunge directly into the list of smartwatches soon to receive Android Wear 2.0 upgrades. First of all, those of you who've decided to go for Huawei's smartwatches will be pleased to know the Chinese company will have the following products updated to Android Wear 2.0: Huawei Watch and Huawei Watch Ladies. Tag Heuer Connected Furthermore, Motorola plans to provide the major OS update to its Moto 360 Gen 2 and Moto 360 Sport and Moto 360 for Women smartwatches, though an exact release date hasn't been confirmed yet. Moving on to LG, the South Korean company, just like Fossil and Motorola, has more smartwatches on the list of compatible devices than any other company: LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, LG Watch Urbane, and LG G Watch R. Asus ZenWatch 2 and ZenWatch 3 will get the Android Wear 2.0 update as well, and so will the rugged Casio's Smart Outdoor Watch and PRO TREK Smart. The newly launched New Balance Run IQ smartwatch is supposed to be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0 as well. Here are the rest of the smartwatches confirmed to get the Android Wear 2.0 update very soon: Polar M600, Nixon Mission, Tag Heuer Connected, Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Founder, Michael Kors Access Bradshaw Smartwatch, and Michael Kors Access Dylan Smartwatch.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Android Wear 2.0#LG smartwatch#Android Wear update#Huawei Watch#Tag Heuer Connected subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news LG Watch Style Retail Package and Manuals Leaked Out LG Watch Sport Smartwatch Spotted in Benchmark Android Wear 2.0 and Google's Smartwatches to Be Announced on February 8 LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Prices Revealed Ahead of Launch Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One 2 photos    LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE new android apps HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

LG and Google reveal first Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches in bid to topple Apple $349 Sport and $249 Style will take on Apple with Android Wear 2.0  Following launch, Android Wear 2.0 update will be rolled out to existing devices For iPhone owners, they will also have iOS compatibility  By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 12:49 EST, 8 February 2017 | Updated: 12:55 EST, 8 February 2017 e-mail 27 shares 20 View comments Google is launching a fresh attack on the smartwatch market with a radically upgraded version of its Android wear software.  Made by LG, the $349 Sport and $249 Style will take on Apple with Android Wear 2.0 - and the software is expected to be available on other watches within weeks as well. The new software has an improved interface, including a new Google Maps app, and can also double as a Android Pay credit card. Scroll down for video  The new LG Style smartwatch: It boasts a 1.2-inch display, and is designed with a basic set of features, and supports interchangeable straps. SMARTWATCH SPECS The Watch Sport has a larger, higher-resolution screen (1.38 inches and 480 x 480, versus Style’s 1.2-inch, 360 x 360 face). It also has more RAM (768MB versus 512MB, although internal storage is 4GB across the board), and a larger battery (430mAh versus 240mAh) Both timepieces feature Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and the Sport model throws in cellular connectivity (with both 3G and LTE data) as well as GPS and NFC radios, so it can be used to make payments. Sport will have a built in heart rate sensor     The new Style has a 1.2-inch display, and is designed with a basic set of features.  The wearable sports a 240mAh battery, 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear processor, 4GB of internal storage and 512MB of RAM.  However, only the more expensive Sport has a heart rate sensor and NFC chip for payments.   The larger device also features LTE, for wireless data and calls, which can be made through an on-board speaker and mic system, along with a bigger battery. It has a 1.38inch  always-on display features a pixel density of 348ppi, with better water and dust resistance. Both will be available through Best Buy and the Google Store, along with carrier partners AT&T and Verizon, in the case of the Sport.  The Style supports interchangeable straps but unfortunately the Sport does not because some of the connectivity is built right into the strap RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next A cure for insomnia?

It also features LTE, for wireless data and calls, which can be made through an on-board speaker and mic system, along with a bigger battery. The two watches will go on sale tomorrow in the US, and the rest of the world later in the year, probably following Mobile World Congress which starts on February 27 in Barcelona.  Teasing the upcoming launch, Jeff Chang, product manager of Android Wear at Google, confirmed the future watch plans in a recent interview.  As well as new hardware, Chang, speaking with The Verge, confirmed the new watches would be the first to run the heavily updated Android Wear 2.0 operating system. WHAT IS ANDROID WEAR?  Android Wear is Google's proprietary software designed to run on touchscreen wearable gadgets. It's an offshoot of Android OS, the world's most popular smartphone software. It uses gesture controls to let users swipe through on-screen apps and menu options. Compatible with all recent Android phones, there's also limited support for iPhone owners. By contrast, the Apple Watch only works with Apple's handsets.  Revamping the software's awkward user interface, the update will also introduce a number of new features. These include Android Pay support, standalone apps that don't require a phone to work, and the recently released voice-controlled Google Assistant. Both will also use adigital crown button to navigate as well as a touchscreen.  For iPhone owners, they will also have iOS compatibility.   Despite having been overtaken by Apple and its Apple Watch at the top of smartwatch sales charts, Chang says Google remains 'quite optimistic' about the future of smartwatches. Unlike Apple, Google doesn't make its own watches, instead partnering with third-party manufacturers and licensing out its software, a move it believes gives it the long-term edge. According to VentureBeat's leaks, the 14.2-millimeters thick Watch Sport (left) will come in titanium and dark blue, while the 10.8-millimeter thick Watch Style — with swappable straps — will be available in titanium, silver, and rose gold. 'We've enabled a lot of diversity with our hardware partners to target different types of consumers and preferences,' Chang said. 'This is a marathon, not a sprint. 'This category of products is here with us to stay.' Despite dodging manufacturing duties on the first Android Wear 2.0 watches, Google is no stranger to making its own gadgets.  Although this mystery manufacturer hasn't been named, Chang confirmed the company had previously made Android Wear devices. This lengthy list could include tech firms such as Samsung, Huawei, Motorola and LG. Pictured is Motorola's 360 2 smartwatch  Earlier this year, the company launched its first own-brand smartphone, the Google Pixel. The new watches have been confirmed for release on an unspecified date in Q1 2017, a period that runs from January 1 to March 31. The new software will also roll out to other Android smartwatches With Mobile World Congress, the Barcelona-based mobile technology show, to run between February 27 and March 2, it's likely the new devices will make their first official appearance around this time. Once the new devices are released, Google has confirmed the Android Wear 2.0 update will be rolled out to a number of existing devices.  THE RUMOURED FEATURES OG THE TWO NEW MODELS WATCH SPORT - CODENAMED ANGELFISH Google is building a sporty, feature-packed watch with it's own Google Assistant embedded. It looks similar to the Moto 360 and LG’s Urbane 2nd Edition LTE. The device, with a smooth circular shape that curves where the watch band touches the wrist and just three buttons, will come in a dark matte grey branded 'titanium'. One large circular crown button is placed along the right-side of the watch-face, with two smaller and circular buttons above and below it.   While the Motorola appears similar to a puck, both Google watches have a lighter frame.

Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers, which featured heavily in many Christmas Day unwrapping frenzies, are bringing voice recognition into people’s homes. The tech also dominated conversations at this year’s CES. This kind of interface may have been around for a while on mobile, but consumers will feel far more comfortable using it within their four walls. Once users realise the effortlessness of using speech to ask for ingredients when cooking or to check the traffic quickly, it’s only a matter of time before voice controls are as normal as tapping on an app. The launch of Google Assistant, the most important feature on the company’s new Pixel phone, along with constant improvements to Siri, mean conversational interfaces are now much more useful than their previous iterations. It could be tempting to dismiss this technology as a gimmick, but several factors are working directly in its favour. First, many of the new smart speakers have a low price point — with the Amazon Echo Dot starting at less than £50 — and the software can work on mobile devices that most people already own. Considering the minimal barriers to entry, and some of the world’s biggest marketing budgets supporting these interfaces, they’ll be at the forefront of consumers’ minds. Even non-techies can use voice commands easily, potentially opening up digital services to a new demographic. Rather than a fad, all signs point to a revolution in user experience. Specific touch-based apps focusing on one service will appear outdated when stood next to this new way of interacting, placing pressure on others to follow suit. If you can't beat them, join them Luckily, third parties will be able to integrate with voice-enabled assistants, rather than reinventing the wheel. Capital One has become the first bank to connect with Amazon Echo, allowing consumers to check balances and pay for goods, while Uber’s partnership allows customers to order rides using their voice. In fact, it will be these third-party apps that will transform conversational interfaces from being useful to essential. As more and more services are added, consumers will come to expect this from other businesses. Those looking to link up to these assistants will rely on open APIs, the publicly accessible part of an application, to accommodate transfers of data and personalise the experience for the consumer. APIs certainly have their benefits, opening up more possibilities to developers than ever before, but they present significant programming challenges too. While things are getting easier and more convenient for the customer, the increasing number of connections will inflate application complexity, making the job much harder for IT teams. Unfortunately, the third-party businesses linking up to these interfaces will bear the biggest compatibility burden, having to ensure the optimum level of performance. Conversational UX is meant to increase convenience, meaning any performance glitches will leave customers frustrated, and potentially prompt them to abandon transactions or go elsewhere. Efficiency will, therefore, be essential. Making applications invisible Creating conversational UX won’t be as easy as connecting to just one of these platforms, either. The whole nature of the conversational interface will rely on going where the customer is, and not the other way around. This means it could go beyond voice to include messaging apps and social media too. MasterCard has already integrated with Facebook Messenger to allow customers to manage their finances using a chatbot. This trajectory will see applications become almost invisible, waiting on standby for whenever the customer needs them. With this ecosystem relying on an intricate network of individual microservices, monitoring and analytics tools that give full application visibility will be necessary to understand what is going on. That said, software alone won’t be enough. There will need to be strong communication between development, operations and the wider business teams to make this work. It’s important to understand not only how things are performing, but also how applications are impacting the business. Technology teams can work out how processes can be improved, but it will ultimately be the wider business that decides whether it gets investment. To ensure everyone is on the same page, teams can establish a common language, focusing on business transactions to make sure they’re driving revenue while improving the experience for the customer. This way, if there is a problem with Amazon’s Echo API, it means that everyone, technical and non-technical, can understand the context of the issue – spelling out how customer experience is taking a hit and how this impacts the bottom line. This is a challenging time for technology teams, but most of them will see results from conversational UX if they move to a more advanced way of maintaining applications. Evidence suggests that voice interfaces are here to stay, and for every company that rejects the idea, another one will take its place. Brands that adopt this technology can now truly impress their customers and keep them from going elsewhere.

LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style with Android Wear 2.0 Officially Introduced GO Available for purchase for $380 and $270, respectively Feb 8, 2017 18:23 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The LG Watch Sport and Style are the first smartwatches powered by Google's new Android Wear 2.0 operating system. They have been teased for about a month now and will make their debut on the market on February 9. They are considered Google's first foray into smartwatch territory, hardware-wise. Although they have been built and are branded by LG, the design is made with the help of Google's engineers. Google and LG have a long partnership history, so there's no surprise that the search giant chose the South Korean company to build its first smartwatches. That being said, it's worth mentioning that LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style smartwatches will be available for purchase beginning February 10 for $380 and $270, respectively. LG Watch Sport will be available in titanium and dark blue, while the LG Watch Style will sell in three different colors: silver, rose gold, and titanium. They will be launched in the United States, but their availability will expand to other countries in late February and March. You can expect them to arrive in Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, UAE and UK in the coming weeks. Spec-wise, the LG Watch Sport is the better-geared of the two. It sports a 1.38-inch OLED display with 480 x 480 pixel resolution. Also, it packs 768MB RAM, 4GB storage and a 430mAh battery. LG Watch Style On the other hand, the smaller LG Watch Style features a 1.2-inch OLED display with 360 x 360 pixel resolution, while at the core of the smartwatch sit 512MB RAM, 4GB internal memory, and a tinier 240mAh battery. Although both smartwatches come with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, those who buy the LG Watch Sport will also be able to take and make calls since it comes with cellular connectivity (3G and LTE support). Of course, GPS and NFC (Near Field Communication) are included as well. The LG Watch Sport also offers Android Pay support and comes with a heart rate sensor inside. As previously reported, both smartwatches benefit from deep Google Assistant integration, as well as enhanced iOS support. Also, the Watch Sport comes with two additional buttons that enable users to quickly open Google Fit and Android Pay apps. Last but not least, LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style feature IP68 and IP67 certifications for water and dust resistance.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (24 Images) #LG Watch Sport#LG Watch Style#Android Wear 2.0#Google smartwatch#LG watch subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style (24 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Releases Android Wear 2.0, Here Is What's New LG Watch Style Retail Package and Manuals Leaked Out LG Watch Sport Smartwatch Spotted in Benchmark Android Wear 2.0 and Google's Smartwatches to Be Announced on February 8 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One 24 photos    LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style New Android APKs HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Google Officially Brings WebVR to Chrome on Android more on: Google i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By Jason Cipriani | February 8, 2017 -- 17:00 GMT (09:00 PST) | Topic: Mobility LG Watch Sport is one of two new Android Wear watches launching alongside Android Wear 2.0. Google Nearly a year ago, we saw our first glimpse of Android Wear 2.0, Google's smartwatch operating platform. It's now finally becoming a reality. Android Wear: What you need to know What is Android Wear? Here's what you need to know about Google's plan for wearables Google's Android Wear wants to make smartwatches more usable and attractive to the masses. Here's what you need to know. Read More Originally scheduled for release alongside Android 7.0 Nougat in fall of 2016, Android Wear 2.0 was eventually delayed until "early 2017." Last month, Google confirmed the operating system would see a public release in February, and true to its word, Android Wear 2.0 will start rolling out on Feb. 10. Complete rollout will depend on the manufacturer of supported watches, with complete availability expected to take a few weeks. Android Wear 2.0 includes standalone apps users can use without a phone nearby, relying instead on a direct Wi-Fi connection or LTE signal depending on the watch's capabilities. A revamped interface throughout Android Wear 2.0 aims to make the watch easier to use and navigate, with support for a rotating digital crown similar to what's found on the Apple Watch. Also included is support for Android Pay on watches equipped with NFC capabilities, and watch faces gain complications, putting more information on a watchface at a glance. At launch, Android Pay will not work when paired with an iOS device. However, Google is working on adding the service as soon as possible. LG Watch Style. Google Google Assistant will also play a key role in Android Wear 2.0, giving users a voice-activated assistant on his or her wrist to answer questions, send messages, start timers, and so on. As Google has done in the past when releasing a major operating system update, the company teamed up with a company to create new devices. This time, Google and LG collaborated on two Android Wear watches. The LG Watch Style and Sport will be available starting Feb. 10 at Best Buy and through Google's online store. With the Sport supporting LTE connectivity, it will also be available at AT&T & Verizon Wireless retail locations. The Watch Sport will retail for $349, while the Style is priced at $249. The difference in pricing is justified when you look at the specs of each watch. Watch Sport Watch Style Size 45.4 x 51.21 x 14.2mm 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm Processor 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 Display 1.38-inch full circle P-OLED (480 x 480 / 348ppi) 1.20-inch full circle P-OLED (360 x 360 / 299ppi) RAM 768MB 512MB Storage 4GB 4GB Battery 430mAh with wireless charging 240mAh with wireless charging Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Sensors Accelerometer, gyroscope, PPG, barometer, ambient light sensor Accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor Color Titanium, Dark Blue (Google Store exclusive) Silver, Titanium, Rose Gold Waterproof Dust and water resistance (IP68) Dust and water resistance (IP67) Both watches will feature a rotating dial for navigation. A dedicated button on the Watch Sport will launch Android Pay, with another button acting as a shortcut to Google Fit. Google and its hardware partners have a lot of work ahead if they want to take on Apple and its smartwatch. The Apple Watch currently accounts for half of the smartwatch market -- and over 80 percent of profit.

The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport have been unveiled and bring a classic look to your wrist, while offering the latest that Android Wear has to offer. LG Watch Sport The LG Watch Sport is the big brother of the two new smartwatches, as it features many add-ons that you would expect from a smartwatch. Other than being powered by Android Wear 2.0, the Watch Sport features a 1.38-inch POLED display, with a resolution of 480 x 480. Powering the Watch Sport is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, along with 768MB of RAM. LG also added 4GB of storage to the smartwatch, if you want to be able to keep music directly on your wrist. In order to take advantage of everything this smartwatch has to offer, you’ll be happy to know that you can leave your smartphone at home as the Watch Sport also includes cellular radios, and GPS. Other features that are packed into the Watch Sport include an NFC chip for Android Pay, as well as a heart rate sensor. If you’re worried about how the Watch Sport will withstand the elements, then you’ll be happy to know that this smartwatch includes an IP68 certification. Finally, the Watch Sport features a 430mAh battery, which can be recharged thanks to wireless charging. The new smartwatch is also available in 2 different colors: Titanium and Dark Blue. LG Watch Style The LG Watch Style is the little brother of the group, with a display that measures in at 1.2-inches with a resolution of 360×360. The Watch Style includes the same Snapdragon 2100 Wear processor and 4GB of storage, but LG reigned back the RAM a bit (512MB). Considering that the Watch Sport is the “flagship” of these two new smartwatches, there aren’t as many extra features packed into here. However, the Watch Style does include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and ambient light sensor. As for the battery, the Watch Style includes a smaller 240mAh battery which can also be recharged wirelessly. Finally, the Watch Style will also be able to withstand some of the elements, as it is IP67 certified. Android Wear 2.0 The latest version of Android Wear has been delayed for sometime after being shown off at Google I/O 2016. Today marks the first day that you can download the new software onto your compatible smartwatch. As for the features that are included, we are looking at an array of new capabilities. The biggest new feature is the addition of Google Assistant. You will be able to quickly ask Assistant to perform any tasks without ever taking out your phone. In order to activate Assistant, you can either hold down the power button on your watch or say “OK Google”. Another big feature of Android Wear 2.0 is the inclusion of new watch faces. These watch faces are interactive and can be personalized to your liking, depending on what time of the day it is. All you’ll need to do, is switch to the watch face that best fits the activity that you’re performing. Google Fit has also seen an upgrade as you can now keep track of your pace, distance, calories burned or heart rate (if you have a compatible smartwatch). These metrics can be measured whether you’re walking, running or cycling. You’ll be able to even measure your various reps that are being taken in the gym, including weight-lifting, push-ups, sit-ups, or squats. Perhaps the other biggest feature coming to Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches is the addition of the Play Store onto your wrist. You will be able to download an array of applications to your smartwatch, including Uber, Android Pay, Runkeeper, and Google Messenger. Pricing & Availability The LG Watch Sport will be available at numerous outlets, including AT&T, Verizon, and the Google Store. The Watch Style will only be available through Best Buy or the Google Store for the time being. Pricing for the LG Watch Sport starts at $379.99, but Verizon is currently offering the smartwatch for $329.99 when purchasing through a 2-year contract. As for AT&T, the Watch Sport will be available for $49.99 with a 2-year agreement with purchase of either the LG G5 or LG V20. AT&T is also offering the Watch Sport for $17.50 per month for 20 months through the carrier’s installment plan. The LG Watch Style is priced at a respectable $249.99, if you’re willing to forego any of the other features packed into the Watch Sport. Both smartwatches will go on sale in the United States starting on February 10th. local_offer    Android Wear   Android Wear 2.0   LG   LG Watch Sport   LG Watch Style   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (4) stars Further Reading LG Watch Syle and Sport now available Wells Fargo and CITI cards don't work with AW 2.0 Mobile Roar 161: What to Wear 2.0 Everything we know about the LG G6 LG releases another invitation for the LG G6 at MWC 2017 stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertHow to Pixel-ize your phone closeHow to make any Android phone look like the Pixel Features like the Pixel Launcher, round icons, new nav bar buttons, and Google Assistant are still exclusive to the Pixel phones.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW DELHI: Internet major Google has won its first city Wi-Fi deal in collaboration with companies like IBM, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and RailTel from Pune Smart City Development Corporation (PSCSCL), a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed for the smart city mission in the city. The latest contract is valued at Rs 150 crore, and includes capital expenditure, operating expenditure and revenue sharing elements, Pune Municipal Commissioner Kunal Kumar told ET. “15-20% revenue generated through this citywide Wi-Fi network will be shared with the authority”. Under the contract, Google will deploy its Google Station platform, which has Wi-Fi network management capability, and focuses on monetisation to make the service self-sustainable. RailTel, on the other hand, will provide last-mile fiber connectivity to enable Wi-Fi hotspots at around 200 strategic locations across the city. “The plan is to integrate all public places on a single platform to aggregate Wi-Fi hotspots that will allow access with one-time authentication,” Kumar added. Larsen & Toubro is the master system integrator for the Pune Smart City project and it will help integrate everything together, Srinivasan Ramamurthy, Lead -Smart World And Communication Business at the company, told ET. He added that the company will also set up emergency call boxes and public address systems, environmental sensors, variable messaging displays, network connectivity and video analytics integration. With Google Station platform, the US major is extending its Wi-Fi service beyond railway stations to places that are frequented by a large number of people, such as malls and transit stations, and in social hangout locations such as cafes and universities. The company had previously said that it will be partnering with large venues and organisations, network operators, fiber providers, system integrators and infrastructure companies to provide Wi-Fi in city areas. Google and IBM didn’t comment on ET queries on the contract. Google has so far been working with RailTel and Indian Railways to provide high-speed Wi-Fi at 400 railway stations throughout the country. So far, over 100 railway stations have been equipped with Wi-Fi hotspots. As part of the Pune project, Google is also working with RailTel and L&T for variable message displays (VMD) that will be used to deliver important information and messages across 161 locations in the city. “One of the important things that we are doing is Wi-Fi, and then we are also establishing the emergency call box and public drop box and environmental sensors…We are working with RailTel for connectivity and Google for putting advertisements,” L&T’s Ramamurthy said. “Google will help us in monetisation through advertisements." Under the deal, IBM is providing its smart city solutions that will work as the backbone of the Pune smart city. IBM is also helping L&T set up a Smart City Operation Centre (SCOC) to integrate all the services and applications on a single platform, which will be able to accommodate all future needs through integration of various citizen-centric applications.

Google Releases Android Wear 2.0, Here Is What's New GO It will be rolled out to compatible watches this month Feb 8, 2017 18:17 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  As expected, Google has just launched the new Android Wear 2.0 operating system, which is to be rolled out as an update to all compatible smartwatches beginning today. The new platform has been in the works for less than a year, but the search giant had to postpone its release for a few months. Alongside Android Wear 2.0, Google introduced its Nexus-like smartwatches, the result of the collaboration with LG: the Watch Sport and Watch Style. Both wearable devices will go on sale tomorrow for $380 and $270, respectively. Android Wear 2.0 brings lots of new features into the mix, and enhances some of the already existent features such as iOS support for example. Among the most important improvements added in Android Wear 2.0, we can mention Google Assistant, which will provide you with answers to all your questions directly on your wrist. You can now hold down the power button on the watch or say “Ok Google” to activate it. Play Video Obviously, Google Assistant is only available in English and German on Android Wear, but support for other languages will be added in the coming months. Google Fit is one of the apps that come pre-installed on just about any Android Wear watch, allowing you to track your pace, distance, calories burned and heart rate while you're running, cycling or simply walking. Android Wear 2.0 also allows users to download apps directly on their watches from the new on-watch Google Play Store. In addition, those watches that feature cellular connectivity will also allow users to make calls and use their watch apps regardless of where the smartphone paired with the watch is. All watches running Android Wear 2.0 will work independently with the following apps: AccuWeather, Android Pay, Bring!, Foursquare, Google Fit, Google Messenger, Google Play Music, Lifesum, Robinhood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Telegram, and Uber. Other apps will be added to the list in the coming weeks. Android Wear 1.x vs. Android Wear 2.0 The new version of the OS enables more options to reply to messages directly from the watch. For example, you can now expand any notification received on the phone and tap to reply by typing, handwriting, dictating, or drawing an emoji. The new notification options will be available for many apps including Facebook Messenger, Glide, Google Messenger, Hangouts, Telegram and WhatsApp. A new Smart Reply option has been added too, which provides users with suggestions based on the messages they have received. Last but not least, Android Wear 2.0 brings even more customized watch faces that provide users with additional options to personalize their wearable devices. You can just swipe to switch the watch face to another one that's more suitable to your next activity (gym, dinner, office, home).   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Android Wear 2.0#Google smartwatch#Android Wear#LG Watch#LG Watch Sport subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Android Wear 2.0 and Google's Smartwatches to Be Announced on February 8 LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Prices Revealed Ahead of Launch Google's Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Leaked in Low-Res Renders Android Wear 2.0 to Supposedly Arrive on February 9 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One 2 photos    Android Wear 2.0 new android apps HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

On Wednesday, it announced that the lion's share of the work is done, save for some last user attachments. The company signed up to work with Google, and as part of the migration process, the tech titan sent a team of engineers (in one case, bearing doughnuts) over to work with its customer on making sure the process was a success. Evernote wanted to take advantage of the cloud to help with features based on machine learning that it has been developing. It also wanted to leverage the flexibility that comes from not having to run a data center. The move is part of a broader trend of companies moving their workloads away from data centers that they own and increasingly using public cloud providers. While the transition required plenty of work and adaptation, Evernote credited Google for pitching in to help with the migration. Why move to the cloud? There was definitely plenty of work to do. Evernote’s backend was built on the assumption that its application would be running on the company’s twin California data centers, not in a public cloud. So why go through all the work? Many of the key drivers behind the move will be familiar to cloud devotees. Evernote employees had to spend time maintaining the company’s data center, doing things like replacing hard drives, moving cables and evaluating new infrastructure options. While those functions were key to maintaining the overall health and performance of the Evernote service, they weren’t providing additional value to customers, according to Ben McCormack, the company’s vice president of operations. “We were just very realistic that with a team the size of Evernote’s operations team, we couldn’t compete with the level of maturity that the cloud providers have got…on provisioning, on management systems, et cetera,” McCormack said.“ We were always going to be playing catch-up, and it’s just a crazy situation to be in.” When Evernote employees thought about refreshing a data center, one of the key issues that they encountered is that they didn’t know what they would need from a data center in five years, McCormack said. Evernote had several public cloud providers it could choose from, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which are both larger players in the public cloud market. But McCormack said the similarities between the company’s current focus and Google’s areas of expertise were important to the choice. Evernote houses a large amount of unstructured data, and the company is looking to do more with machine learning. “You add those two together, Google is the leader in that space,” McCormack said. “So effectively, I would say, we were making a strategic decision and a strategic bet that the areas that are important to Evernote today, and the areas we think will be important in the future, are the same areas that Google excels in.” Machine learning was a highlight of Google’s platform for Evernote CTO Anirban Kundu, who said that higher-level services offered by Google help provide the foundation for new and improved features. Evernote has been driving toward a set of new capabilities based on machine learning, and Google services like its Cloud Machine Learning API help with that. While cost is often touted as a benefit of cloud migrations, McCormack said that it wasn’t a primary driver of Evernote’s migration. While the company will be getting some savings out of the move, he said that cost wasn’t a limitation for the transition. The decision to go with Google over another provider like AWS or Azure was driven by the technology team at Evernote, according to Greg Chiemingo, the company’s senior director of communications. He said in an email that CEO Chris O’Neill, who was at Google for roughly a decade before joining Evernote, came in to help with negotiations after the decision was made. How it happened Once Evernote signed its contract with Google in October, the clock was ticking. McCormack said that the company wanted to get the migration done before the new year, when users looking to get their life on track hammer the service with a flurry of activity. Before the start of the year, Evernote needed to migrate 5 billion notes and 5 billion attachments. Because of metadata, like thumbnail images, included with those attachments, McCormack said that the company had to migrate 12 billion attachment files. Not only that, but the team couldn’t lose any of the roughly 3 petabytes of data it had. Oh yeah, and the Evernote service needed to stay up the entire time. McCormack said that one of the Evernote team’s initial considerations was figuring out what core parts of its application could be entirely lifted and shifted into Google’s cloud, and what components would need to be modified in some way as part of the transition. Part of the transformation involved reworking the way that the Evernote service handled networking. It previously used UDP Multicast to handle part of its image recognition workflow, which worked well in the company’s own data center where it could control the network routers involved. But that same technology wasn’t available in Google’s cloud. Kundu said Evernote had to rework its application to use a queue-based model leveraging Google’s Cloud Pub/Sub service, instead. Evernote couldn’t just migrate all of its user data over and then flip a switch directing traffic from its on-premises servers to Google’s cloud in one fell swoop. Instead, the company had to rearchitect its backend application to handle a staged migration with some data stored in different places. The good news is that the transition didn’t require changes to the client. Kundu said that was key to the success of Evernote’s migration, because not all of the service’s users upgrade their software in a timely manner. Evernote’s engagement with Google engineers was a pleasant surprise to McCormack. The team was available 24/7 to handle Evernote’s concerns remotely, and Google also sent a team of its engineers over to Evernote’s facilities to help with the migration. Those Google employees were around to help troubleshoot any technical challenges Evernote was having with the move. That sort of engineer-to-engineer engagement is something Google says is a big part of its approach to service. For one particularly important part of the migration, Google’s engineers came on a Sunday, bearing doughnuts for all in attendance. More than that, however, McCormack said that he was impressed with the engineers’ collaborative spirit. “We had times when…we had written code to interface with Google Cloud Storage, we had [Google] engineers who were peer-reviewing that code, giving feedback and it genuinely felt like a partnership, which you very rarely see,” McCormack said. “Google wanted to see us be successful, and were willing to help across the boundaries to help us get there.” In the end, it took roughly 70 days for the whole migration to take place from the signing of the contract to its final completion. The main part of the migration took place over a course of roughly 10 days in December, according to McCormack. Lessons learned If there was one thing Kundu and McCormack were crystal clear about, it’s that even the best-laid plans require a team that’s willing to adapt on the fly to a new environment. Evernote’s migration was a process of taking certain steps, evaluating what happened, and modifying the company’s approach in response to the situation they were presented with, even after doing extensive testing and simulation. Furthermore, they also pointed out that work on a migration doesn’t stop once all the bytes are loaded into the cloud. Even with extensive testing, the Evernote team encountered new constraints working in Google’s environment once it was being used in production and bombarded with activity from live Evernote users. For example, Google uses live migration techniques to move virtual machines from one host to another in order to apply patches and work around hardware issues. While that happens incredibly quickly, the Evernote service under full load had some problem with it, which required (and still requires) optimization. Kundu said that Evernote had tested live migration prior to making the switch over to GCP, but that wasn’t enough. When an application is put into production, user behavior and load on it might be different from test conditions, Kundu said. “And that’s where you have to be ready to handle those edge cases, and you have to realize that the day the migration happens or completes is not the day that you’re all done with the effort. You might see the problem in a month or whatever.” Another key lesson, in McCormack’s opinion, is that the cloud is ready to handle any sort of workload. Evernote evaluated a migration roughly once every year, and it was only about 13 months ago that the company felt confident a cloud transition would be successful. “Cloud has reached a maturity level and a breadth of features that means it’s unlikely that you’ll be unable to run in the cloud,” McCormack said. That’s not to say it doesn’t require effort. While the cloud does provide benefits to Evernote that the company wasn’t going to get from running its own data center, they still had to cede control of their environment, and be willing to lose some of the telemetry they’re used to getting from a private data center. Evernote’s engineers also did a lot of work on automating the transition. Moving users’ attachments over from the service’s on-premises infrastructure to Google Cloud Storage is handled by a pair of bespoke automated systems. The company used Puppet and Ansible for migrating the hundreds of shards holding user note data. The immediate benefits of a migration One of the key benefits of Evernote’s move to Google’s cloud is the company’s ability to provide reduced latency and improved connection consistency to its international customers. Evernote’s backend isn’t running in a geographically distributed manner right now, but Google’s worldwide networking investments provide an improvement right away. “We have seen page loading times reducing quite significantly across some parts of our application,” McCormack said. “I wouldn’t say it’s everywhere yet, but we are starting to see that benefit of the Google power and the Google reach in terms of bridging traffic over their global fiber network.” Right now, the company is still in the process of migrating the last of its users’ attachments to GCP. When that’s done, however, the company will be able to tell its users that all the data they have in the service is encrypted at rest, thanks to the capabilities of Google’s cloud. From an Evernote standpoint, the company’s engineers have increased freedom to get their work done using cloud services. Rather than having to deal with provisioning physical infrastructure to power new features, developers now have a whole menu of options when it comes to using new services for developing features. “Essentially, any GCP functionality that exists, they’re allowed to access, play with — within constraints of budget, obviously — and be able to build against.” In addition, the cloud provides the company with additional flexibility and peace of mind when it comes to backups, outages and failover. What comes next? Looking further out, the company is interested in taking advantage of some of Google’s existing and forthcoming services. Evernote is investigating how it can use Google Cloud Functions, which lets developers write snippets of code that then run in response to event triggers. Evernote is also alpha testing some Google Cloud Platform services that haven’t been released or revealed to the public yet. Kundu wouldn’t provide any details about those services. In a similar vein, Kundu wouldn’t go into details about future Evernote functionality yet. However, he said that there are “a couple” of new features that have been enabled as a result of the migration. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google Bug Shows Desktop URLs In Mobile Results Google Bug Shows Desktop URLs In Mobile Results Feb 8, 2017 • 7:44 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Yesterday, I posted fake news around the potential of Google testing the mobile-first index in the wild. Well, I did say maybe and this is what people were asking. But it seems to be wrong and rather a bug with Google showing desktop URLs in the mobile results. In fact, it may be that Google deindexed the mobile URLs by accident. John Mueller of Google somewhat confirmed the bug on Twitter this morning saying "we noticed too and are looking into it on our side." "Seems like a quirk on our side," John added. Here are the tweets: @razbithume yeah, looks weird :). We noticed too and are looking into it on our side. Seems like a quirk on our side.— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) February 8, 2017 In short, if you searched for some sites that ran over the m-dot version, i.e. m.ikea.com or m.youtube.com Google would show the desktop URL and not the mobile m-dot URL. This obviously doesn't impact responsive sites but it does impact m-dot sites. Many noticed this: Has all m. domains had their front-pages de-indexed? Even https://t.co/lxcEyhwCpu seems to have trouble. @methode or @JohnMu?— Bernt Johansson (@berntjohansson) February 7, 2017 In fact, Tejas Thakkar posted a more detailed look at this issue over here. I suspect this bug will be fixed soon but it is good to know Google is aware of it and working on it. Forum discussion at Twitter.

If you have one review, Google will typically just not show the review or star rating. But Neal Resnik spotted and posted on Twitter an example of a local listing in the local pack with one review and Google showing stars. Here is a screen shot: Neil said "today must be a testing day at Google. Here's a star rating for a business with one review." Joy Hawkins also posted about it on Twitter, citing Neil and overall, it confuses the local community. Maybe this is an example of there use to being more reviews and then some of the reviews drop but Google keeps the ratings? Maybe not? I am not sure. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google Updates > Google Search Algorithm Update February 7th Google Search Algorithm Update February 7th Feb 8, 2017 • 8:21 am | (123) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google PageRank & Algorithm Updates Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story We just had some Google algorithm update a week ago potentially targeting spammy links I believe. And now a week later, around February 7th, yesterday, it seems there was another algorithm update. This update doesn't seem specific to links or spam but rather just a normal unconfirmed Google update where ranking changes shift based on something changing at Google. I do not believe it is related to the mobile bug because most of the automated tracking tools only track desktop search. There is some chatter, the chatter in the SEO community is not YET that hot but it might heat up throughout the day as people check their analytics and tools. An ongoing WebmasterWorld thread has these posts: SERPs movements again in our vertical. We're seeing some recoveries from previous penguin casualties and some domain crowding. Spam STILL having a huge positive impact. Yesterday (Tue 7th) I saw a huge spike in organic traffic, ~30% over avg, and 18% increase from previous record day in November. It's a Canadian financial-related site. Increases from both Google.ca as well as other search engines/ Here is a post on Twitter that even caught Gary Illyes attention: @vladrpt ack— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) February 8, 2017 And here are the tracking tools showing changes on the 7th, note Mozcast is well behind in terms of tracking so this might be related to the link spam update we covered last week? Mozcast: SERP Metrics: Algoroo: Accuranker: RankRanger: Have you noticed any changes over the past 24 hours? Forum discussion at WebmasterWorld.

With the launch of Android Wear 2.0, the first major update to Google's smartwatch operating system in nearly three years, comes two new smartwatches to run the new OS created out of a partnership with LG. The new watches — the LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style — are simultaneously pared-down and beefed up, with a design to help facilitate Google's focus on on-watch messaging, fitness, and the addition of the Google Assistant. The watches go on sale February 10, retailing for $349 and $249, respectively. I tested the LG Watch Style, the slimmer, more stylish alternative to the Sport, a hulking gadget with its own SIM card and advanced fitness tracking capabilities. The Style, available at both Best Buy and the Google Store, is being marketed as a watch for "trendsetters," a device for daily use that can nearly pass as a standard timepiece. It's not yet the perfect smartwatch — if there is such a thing — but it's a clean, modern, and useful gadget that proves wearables may not be dead after all.   A fashion-conscious approach The LG Watch Style is billed as just that: a style-conscious watch designed to be as unobtrusive as possible.  The watch is thicker than a standard timepiece, but not overly so. In fact, I was impressed by the amount of computing power contained in a device that's less than a half-inch thick. The display is about 1.2 inches in diameter, which I was surprised to learn is actually smaller than the Daniel Wellington watch I wear every day.  The Style also comes in three different finishes — silver, titanium, and rose gold — and comes standard with an Italian leather band, although it can be easily swapped out if you prefer a rubberized band.  Compared to some of its predecessors — and particularly its companion watch, the Sport — the Style watch is stylish. It wasn't over-designed and Google clearly took into account the types of watches that are gaining popularity in the fashion world: an oversized face, only one side dial, and a variety of metal finishes, including rose gold. The launch of the Style watch appears to be an attempt to cater to both women and those who are wary of smartwatches in general. But it's actually from a fashion perspective where the Style watch had two shortcomings, though minor ones: I wasn't impressed by the plastic backing on it, and the Italian leather strap didn't look as high-end as what I'd expect from a $250 watch.   Still, I felt for the most part that the watch cleverly disguised itself as any other piece of jewelry, which is one major advantage it has over the Apple Watch. Men will likely be comfortable with the size and weight of it, while women will find its look more fashion-forward than other smartwatches on the market.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc Hollis Johnson A well-rounded gadget Using the LG Watch Style is intuitive and uncomplicated. With the option to scroll by touch, with the dial, or by built-in gesture commands, Google doesn't put pressure on the user to use only the screen to navigate the watch. For the thick-fingered or farsighted, this is a huge plus.  One important difference between the LG Watch Style and its bigger sibling, the LG Watch Sport, is that it's designed to be an everyday watch that can carry you from the gym to work to a night out on the town. For those looking for a full-service fitness tracker, the Style watch is not it — but it's not intended to be. Google built in just enough of those features to make the Style watch a well-rounded gadget.  That said, two major limitations of the Style is the lack of a heart rate monitor and the fact it's not waterproof. It is water-resistant — it can hold up to a heavy soaking in a rain storm — but you can't go swimming with it like you can with the Apple Watch Series 2. (The Apple Watch Series 2 isn't waterproof either, but water-resistant up to 50 meters; the LG Watch Sport is a bit more water-resistant than the Style, as it can only last about 30 minutes in 1.5 meters of water.) Again, the LG Watch Style isn't a heavy-duty fitness-tracking watch. But those features would be nice to have and, frankly, almost expected at this point in the smartwatch game. Conclusions Using the LG Watch Style was more enjoyable than most other smartwatches I've tried. It expertly straddles the line between staying true to the intention of a smartwatch — the "Always On" feature, which ensures your watch actually tells you the time, is key to that — while paying attention to trends in technology and thoughtfully implementing them on a small device. W hile it's not the most stylish watch I've ever worn, it is a definite improvement over its predecessors from an aesthetic standpoint. If the Style watch goes head to head with the LG Watch Sport, or even an Apple Watch 2, it's the obvious winner from both a comfort and fashion standpoint.  Still, the LG Watch Style isn't perfect — if there is such a thing — but it's the best smartwatch for most people: It's thin, it's lightweight, and it's aesthetically pleasing, but above all, it's subtle enough so that if you're wearing one, you won't seem like a gadget nerd.

Google has finally revealed its latest Android Wear 2.0 operating system to all, and with it comes two new watches to show it off to its fullest: The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style. Both offer the latest design and specs to display the OS at its best. With variations in price and sensors, LG is giving you the option of a design-focused smartwatch or a more tech-heavy, sports-focused wearable. Watch: Trusted Explains – Wearables and Fitness Buying Guide LG Watch Style and Watch Sport – Design, Build and Display When it comes to design, as the name suggests, the LG Watch Style is the one to go for. This is the smallest Android Wear watch yet, which means it feels good on the wrist. Slipping it under a sleeve and back out is a doddle, making it a genuine wear-all-day kind of watch. LG Watch Style in its three different finishes The LG Watch Style looks attractive: it has a brushed metal frame finish and a new 1.2-inch 360 x 360 P-OLED display that makes the bezels fall away. Designed specifically to show off the Android Wear 2.0 operating system, it uses that entire face to offer maximum use of space for information delivery, without compromising on the aesthetics. The Watch Style is available in three colours: silver with natural leather, rose gold with cream leather, or black on black. Thanks to quick-release straps, combinations can be mixed and new straps are likely incoming. Related: Best Smartwatches The LG Watch Sport has two extra side buttons and a larger display The LG Watch Sport is also a well-designed bit of kit, featuring the same P-OLED display. But here it's larger at 1.38 inches and higher resolution at 480 x 480, and crams in more sensors. As such, its sits at 14.8mm tall, which is understandable when you consider all this watch does. LG has managed to keep its size under control by squeezing the antennas into the bands. It also features extra side buttons that are nestled into the watch so they don't protrude too much, meaning you’re left with a comfy fit that I’d imagine remains so even when running, but will require a longer period of time testing. The Watch Sport will be available in titanium and dark blue options that are exclusive to the Google Store. Both watches feature rotating crown buttons that allow for easy access to apps, while also keeping fingerprints away from the watch faces. A similar interaction method to the Apple Watch. LG Watch Style and Watch Sport – Specifications, Connectivity and Sensors Both the Sport and Style use Qualcomm's 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor. Their specs differ when it comes to RAM, however, with the Sport packing in 768MB and the Style making do with 512MB. Both models come with 4GB of storage on board, which is common for Android Wear devices. Differences also arise when it comes to batteries, though. The Sport has a large 430mAh battery, while the Style's is only 240mAh. This makes sense considering the Sport has so many more sensors. Both watches will supposedly get you through a day of use. The LG Watch Style is all about about the look and therefore includes more basic sensor capabilities with step counting about the extent of what you’ll get without being connected to a phone when it comes to fitness. The LG Watch Sport, however, is crammed full of tech. It features GPS, NFC with Android Pay, an optical heart rate monitor and antennas built into the band for LTE network connectivity. This means, alongside the improvements with Android Wear 2.0, there's far less dependency on your connected smartphone. So you can go out for a run and track it using GPS, pair wireless headphones using Bluetooth, keep tabs on your heart rate, and even stream Spotify music using the built-in LTE modem. You can even make payments using NFC – so no need for your wallet, either. Despite all that, it should still offer all-day battery life – the same as the Watch Style model – but this will require more time being spent with the watch to test. We’ll have to wait for a review unit to decide just how accurate that heart rate monitor is, too. LG Watch Style and Watch Sport – Android Wear 2.0 Google has released a whole host of updates for its new mobile wearable OS and the LG Watch designs are all about showing off those features. The new watch face personalisation means everything can be far more accessible from the watch face. Now you can set third-party app data to appear, resulting in at-a-glance information beyond just time, date and perhaps battery or steps. You'll be more easily able to view the time of your next meeting, how far away your Uber is, quickly call a contact, and more – the options are plentiful and exciting. Related: Android Wear 2.0 Guide The new interface is minimal, drawing on Google's Material Design aesthetic, but with greater information available. It looks super-impressive and will likely make the watch a viable alternative to taking your phone out, saving both battery and hassle. For the LG Watch Sport, Google Fit has been improved and even has a dedicated quick-start button. You can track your running pace, speed, time, heart rate and more while running or cycling, but you can even measure weight training reps at the gym. Android Wear 2.0 can potentially track press-ups, deadlifts, chin-ups, bicep curls – the whole package. Google Fit also plays nice with other apps, so you should be able to share data with likes of MapMyFitness more easily. Android Wear 2.0 is built for network connectivity, so you can use the watch for training or similar, while still being alerted to calls and messages – minus a connected phone. It won’t matter if you have an iPhone or Android phone, either, with greater cross-compatibility. Responding to messages should be simple, too, thanks to voice dictation, typing and handwriting recognition options. All work well. Which you choose to use will come down to personal preference and, perhaps, the situation you’re in at the time. As ever, even in noisy environments, the Google Assistant voice recognition is excellent and, thanks to network connectivity, should remain that way even without a phone. So controlling everything using your voice is a reality now, one that will only get better as the Assistant builds greater familiarity. To access the Assistant, just hold the side button or say “OK Google” and you’re good to go. LG Watch Sport and Style – Release Date and Pricing With regards to the availability of the watches in the UK, LG has stated that “they will be available in the coming weeks”. US details are at least more concrete: the LG Watch Style will cost $249, while the LG Watch Sport will cost $349. Both watches will be released on 10 February – which is very soon indeed. First Impressions The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style really could spell the beginning of properly useful smartwatches, which take away the need for always carrying your phone. Both watches have so far shown themselves as excellent showcases for Android Wear 2.0's big new features. Of course, which watch will be for you will depend on whether you need the extra sports functionality of the more expensive watch. It's still a shame that NFC hasn't made it to the cheaper Watch Style model, as it therefore misses out on the convenience of Android Pay. Be sure to check back for a full review as soon as we're able to test out both watches on our wrists.

Android Wear 2.0 is an evolutionary update to Google’s smartwatch OS Posted Feb 8, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story SumUp co-founders are back with bookkeeping AI startup Zeitgold Advertisement Google is officially launching Android Wear 2.0 today — the biggest update to the company’s wearable operating system since its launch in 2014. If you’re not a Wear aficionado who has been patiently waiting for this release, you probably remember Wear 2.0 from its Google I/O announcement last May. Even though in day-to-day use, the updated version feels very much like the next logical evolution of Wear, it took Google far longer than expected to launch it. “The approach that we took as we got started was to build an ecosystem of partners — so not just do a one-size-fit all solution,” David Singleton, the head of the Google Wear project, told me. “But build an ecosystem of partners to create a diverse set of styles and sizes. We felt strongly that it was time to work with our traditional — but also non-traditional — partners to create this ecosystem.” While the overall outlook on the market doesn’t always look positive, Singleton argues that Google saw double-digit growth in activations year-over-year. Only looking at the holiday season, Google says it saw 70 percent year-over-year growth. Today, however, Wear 2.0 is launching with two new flagship watches from LG: the gargantuan, feature-rich LG Watch Sport and the comparatively demure and pared-down LG Watch Style. You can find our respective reviews here and here. A number of existing Wear watches will also get this update in the coming weeks and months. Even though it took Google a few months longer than expected to roll out Wear 2.0, which meant its partners missed the ever-important December shopping season, the final version that’s launching today still sticks to the basics Google announced last year. New features include support for standalone apps, Android Pay, dials and — of course — the Google Assistant. As Singleton stressed, the idea behind all of this work was to take what the team learned from how people used the previous version and focus on making exactly those things easier. Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes The one thing Singleton and his team seemed to be especially excited about was the ability to quickly change watch faces in Wear 2.0. In earlier versions, you had to perform a long press on the watch face to switch faces. Now you can simply sweep left or right to change them. I admit that I don’t fully share their enthusiasm for this feature, but, to be fair, it does make switching between a work-centric watch face with your calendar and a fancier one for after work a bit easier. As far as the watch faces go, though, the one feature I definitely was able to get excited about is that the new designs now have slots for showing data from third-party applications. Maybe you want to see your battery life there, or your steps from Google Fit, or how much water you drank from Lifesum, or the outdoor temperature based on data from the Weather.com app. This is now a deep, built-in feature of Wear 2.0 that allows third-party services to make this data available on the watch face. It’s up to the designers to decide how they want to display this info, and the new LG watches already show a couple of different options for this. Before any of this, though, the first thing you’ll notice when you get a 2.0 watch is the overall update to its design — both in terms of the overall look but also the user experience. The look of Wear 2.0 now skews closer to Google’s Material Design guidelines. While the overall look will still feel familiar to Wear 1.x users, the update put a stronger emphasis on cards, for example. This means every notification now gets a full screen to show its preview and you can use the watch’s dial to scroll through them (assuming your watch has a dial, of course. — otherwise you can obviously still use the touch screen to scroll). The other marquee feature of Wear 2.0 is support for standalone apps that don’t need a companion app to run on your phone. That means developers can write apps that are purely geared toward the watch and they can then publish it on the Google Play store, which is now also available directly on the watch. That sounds more useful than it is — unless you plan on getting an LTE-enabled watch and leave your phone at home. That’s an option now that you could run Hangout or Google Music directly on the watch, but, except for runners, that’s likely not a typical use case. At the end of the day, the most important use case for a smartwatch remains dealing with notifications. Everything else often feels like an unnecessary complication. For the most part, the standalone apps that are available right now aren’t all that exciting either. There also aren’t all that many available right now. Some of the apps Google promised for the launch include Foursquare, Robin Hood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Todoist, Nest and Uber. The team specifically singled out Google’s own Fit app, too, which now supports more exercises than before, in addition to an interactive coaching experience. To be fair, Wear 2.0 does make it easier to use these apps. To get to them, you only have to push the watch’s dial. In addition, you also can use the dial to scroll through them. Instinctively, I assumed that I could then start an app by pressing the dial again, but that just takes you back to the home screen. Still, the additional support for dials and buttons is an admission on Google’s part that smartwatches should have some kind of physical button. The Wear 1.0 launch device — the LG Watch — famously didn’t have any physical buttons (not even to turn it on). The new LG Watch Sport however has two buttons and a dial and Wear 2.0 makes it easy to assign various functions to them, too. That makes using these watches easier at times, but it’s not exactly a revolutionary breakthrough. Android Wear now also features a keyboard. That may sound like an insane idea, given how small these watches’ screens are, but because it uses Google’s predictive technology, it works surprisingly well. You wouldn’t want to use if for typing long messages, and it’s really more about swiping than pecking for individual letters, but if you’re in a place where using voice input isn’t an option, it’s a good alternative. Wear has gotten significantly smarter, though. It now features support for the Google Assistant and smart replies. The Assistant on the watch works just as well as on any other device, including the Google Home or the Pixel. There really isn’t much more to say here. Google Now on Android Wear was already pretty useful, too, after all (and where Now ends and the Assistant starts isn’t always clear anyway). It would be nice if you could also type questions so that you could use the Assistant in a quiet room. Singleton says that’s something the team is thinking about. Smart Replies may actually be the more exciting feature here. It looks at your conversation and then suggests possible replies based on its understanding. I never found that very useful in Inbox, where this made its debut, but on the go, it sure makes answering messages easier. Singleton told me that the algorithms for Smart Replies actually run right on the watch. It’s an evolution Looking at the list of features, this may not sound like a major update and more like a series of incremental updates to existing parts of Wear 1.x. We also ran into our fair share of bugs while testing the new LG watches. After first setting the LG Watch Style up, for example, we got stuck in tutorial mode and didn’t receive any notifications until we reset the watch. An emergency patch Google released over the last weekend fixed most of these issues, however, so I assume the final version that rolls out to consumers won’t have these issues.   The new LG watches are interesting in their own ways and they showcase the new features of Wear 2.0. The LG Watch Sport, especially, feels like Google and LG wanted to show off every possible feature of Wear 2.0, but that doesn’t necessarily make for a great watch. The smaller and cheaper LG Watch Style, on the other hand, shows a more restrained approach. The Android smartwatch market could use a revolution to kickstart what now occasionally feels like a moribund ecosystem. Wear 2.0 doesn’t feel revolutionary. It is, however, a perfectly adequate update that addresses many of the issues with Android Wear. It also puts it on parity with its competitors, like Apple’s watchOS or Samsung’s Tizen. It does also introduce some new use cases for LTE-enabled watches, but I can’t help but feel that this will remain a niche category. Much, however, will depend on Google’s hardware partners who will now have to bring Wear 2.0 to life. 0 SHARES Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 13 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 14 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 15 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 18 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From Gadgets Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 9 hours ago | Anthony Ha VAVA’s new dash cam lets you video while you voom 18 hours ago | John Biggs A Nike HyperAdapt teardown might hint at what’s to come for the self-lacing shoes yesterday | Brian Heater Zuckerberg shows off Oculus gloves for typing in VR yesterday | Josh Constine Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next SumUp co-founders are back with bookkeeping AI startup Zeitgold Posted Feb 8, 2017 CrunchBoard Job Listings Data Migration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) Integration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE at Waxman Strategies (Washington, DC, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Data Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Roll that all up and you're left with an extremely alluring presentation that makes a mighty strong argument for Google's wearable platform. But there are some familiar wrinkles here. Battery life is still a low point, and, as independent as Android Wear 2.0 claims to be, Google is still in the early days of filling the new Play Store with compatible apps that are enticing enough to bother with aside from its own. The Style's appeal lies more in what it will be soon, rather than what it is at launch. That said, it’s easy to express why the Style is the only smartwatch we want to put on our wrists. For $249 (UK and AU pricing haven't been announced yet, but converts to £200 / AU$325), it offers just as much utility as prior smartwatch attempts, but ups the ante with a slim, dashing design and several welcome features, like the voice-activated Google Assistant and a refreshed user interface that's full of clever tweaks. The LG Watch Style is priced aggressively compared to past smartwatches and even many of the best fitness trackers out there. The Style may not be quite as independent from your phone as the cellular-ready LG Watch Sport , but it's currently one of the smartest wearables around, and one of the smartest purchases you could make this year.  LG Watch Style release date and price The LG Watch Style will be available on February 10 in the United States at Best Buy retail and online stores, as well as from the Google Store.  Unfortunately, Google hasn’t provided us with specific release date or pricing information for regions outside of the US, but has shared that it “will be available at carriers and retailers across Canada, Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, UAE and U.K. in the coming weeks”. We’ll update this section when we know more. As mentioned, the Style sells for $249, which is the same price the original Moto 360 launched at, and $20 higher than the Asus ZenWatch 3 . But for a smartwatch with the most recent Android Wear software out of the box and some cutting-edge smartwatch features, this doesn’t seem like a ridiculous price to ask. Design It’s like the Pebble Time Round and Moto 360 2nd Gen had a baby The thinnest Android Wear smartwatch yet at 10.8mm and light, too As such, it essentially disappears on the wrist On the wrist the Style is minimal indeed, which is something we've been dying to say about an Android Wear smartwatch for years. The soft and rounded sand-blasted stainless steel chassis definitely plays a big part in that. But it's also one of the lighter smartwatches we've worn at 46 grams; for the sake of comparison, the LG Watch Sport is nearly double the weight at 89 grams. Around the watch you'll find familiar classic timepiece accents like a circular build and a prominent hardware button. A few other smartwatches, like the Moto 360 2nd Gen, the Huawei Watch and others feature such design traits.   But you'll also stumble upon some features that are unique to this watch, most notably the colorful 1.2-inch P-OLED 360 x 360 resolution (299ppi) display, which has an ambient light sensor (ALS) embedded beneath the screen. Remember the dreaded flat tire? LG and Google have figured out how to get rid of it.   Next up, the button here doubles as a twistable crown that puts a new spin on navigating through Android Wear (think: Apple Watch ’s Digital Crown). So far, the only other Google watch to feature this functionality is the LG Watch Sport, but expect to see this feature coming to many others, both new and old, in the future.  Moving to the bottom of the watch, the smooth matte plastic bottom that allows for conductive charging also aids in keeping it light on the wrist and cool to the touch after charging . Fortunately, steel makes up a large part of its build, so the use of plastic doesn’t detract from the premium look and feel. Basically, the LG Watch Style is equal parts Pebble Time Round and Moto 360 2nd Gen in its design. LG and Google supplied TechRadar with a rose gold review unit, which stands apart from the current fleet of Android Wear smartwatches a little more clearly than the silver and black options. Credit: Google The 42mm watch measures up at 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm and comes with a cream colored leather band, but accepts any and all 18mm bands – including Google’s own Android Wear Mode bands, which are available in both leather and silicone.     Inside the box there’s a magnetic conductive charger and wall plug included – the Style can automatically orient its screen in landscape mode when on its side, so it makes a decent bed-side clock if you’re in a pinch. New Snapdragon chipset mixed with tried and true specs make for a smooth experience LG and Google have figured out how to banish the dreaded flat tire Google Fit’s much-needed update makes Android Wear surprisingly fitness-savvy In the way it's being promoted, you could consider the LG Watch Style as a flagship smartwatch. But a look at the tech inside shows that it doesn’t pack in any more than it needs to. The 360 x 360 display is running at a slightly lower resolution than the Huawei Watch, which runs at 400 x 400, but the pixel density here is slightly greater at 299ppi versus 286ppi – a difference you’ll likely not notice unless you’re really searching. We're well acquainted with the Huawei Watch, and the two look remarkably similar in terms of their display quality. Underneath the screen, LG has thankfully opted for the Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset, instead of the outdated Snapdragon 400 series that powered the first wave of Android Wear smartwatches. Since its launch in late 2016, we’ve seen this long-awaited tech arrive in a few Android Wear 2.0-compatible devices, like the Asus ZenWatch 3 and Fossil Q Wander . But the Style is the first to put it to full use, with the new software and all its perks out of the box. The LG Watch Style features 512MB of RAM and 4GB of onboard storage, two specs that haven’t wiggled much since Android Wear watches were introduced in 2015.  It might seem a bit strange for a cutting-edge smartwatch to stick to old ways, but when paired with the new Snapdragon Wear chipset and Android Wear 2.0, day-to-day use seems to hum along more smoothly and quickly on the whole here than we’ve seen with previous version of the OS. Performance While the LG Watch Style doesn’t break many barriers in terms of its specs (apart from the newer chipset), it has no problem providing a solid experience throughout. The Style gets a special nod for doing so all while handling a greater amount of tasks independently of your paired phone, a new skill bestowed by Android Wear 2.0. That freedom allows you to do things like running native applications through the new Google Play Store that’s integrated right into the watch; sending messages via emoji, voice or swipe keyboard; and playing with watch face complications – an endlessly entertaining and potential-filled addition to Google’s watch OS. And they're just a few of the new tricks to be discovered.  Despite the diminutive upgrades to its spec sheet, our time with the LG Watch Style wasn’t filled with the usual issues we experience with most Android Wear smartwatches.  The new operating system, fresh out of its long developer preview stint, is much more fluid than before; it crashes less often, and although app boot times aren’t instantaneous, it sure beats reaching for our phone. Better yet, compared to Android Wear 1.5, we're now spending more time than ever just having fun with the watch, and executing actions we weren't able to before.  Although doing so puts some serious strain on the battery, we're more than happy to stick it on the charger so we can get back to barking commands to Google Assistant all the sooner – more on this a little later on. Fitness Android Wear isn’t exactly synonymous with fitness tracking, but the latest iteration of the OS looks to change that. Although the Style lacks the heart rate sensor and barometer found in the LG Watch Sport, it’s still a fairly robust fitness tracker thanks to the improvements made to Google Fit. Having also graduated to version 2.0, Google Fit is blended into the new OS at a deeper level, and as a result is more capable than you may remember - with complications now available. Many of the default watch faces (which borrow from the best themes and wallpapers from Google’s Nexus and Pixel lineup) allow you to embed stats like step count, your fitness goals, or a quick shortcut to begin an exercise of your choice in seconds. In addition to making it easier to queue up a workout, Google Fit now offers a greater variety to choose from than before. Instead of some rather binary options, like walking, running, biking and a few challenges, Google Fit now offers more diverse workouts. Here’s the full list of heart-pumping workouts you can track:   Walking Running Treadmill running Biking Stationary biking Aerobics Stair climbing machine Push-up challenge Sit-up challenge Squat challenge Whether you’ve selected aerobics or any other available workout, you can narrow down your focus by adjusting the metrics tracked. Is time spent at the gym more important than the number of calories burnt? Are you gunning for a good pace for a marathon? Then you can choose to prioritize these over steps taken. These types of adjustments are simple. In the case of the Style, the list of workouts supported is limited by the hardware inside. The LG Watch Sport , which features a heart rate sensor and barometer, is able to provide heart-rate targeted training, and can track the amount of steps you’ve taken. According to Google, the Sport’s exclusive 'strength training' exercise utilizes the accelerometer and gyroscope to track the watch’s location on all three axes, to track basically whatever sort of muscle-building activity you might be doing. If those stats are super-important to you then the Sport may be the better option, even if it’s a much larger fit on the wrist. Lastly, the Style is rated IP67 for resistance to dust and water. This comes in handy when working out, as the watch can easily take some sweat or the one-off splash of water; just make sure you take it off before you dive into the pool. Native apps make Android Wear miles better for iOS users Promise of apps is good, but they need to come fast to compete with watchOS Battery is small and its performance isn’t great, a cost to pay for thinness and functionality Historically, this section of a smartwatch review is usually reserved as a place for us to simultaneously celebrate and roast Android Wear.  Previous iterations of the operating system have extended compatibility to Apple’s side of the game, which is awesome, but the experience up to this point has been a far cry compared to what Android phone owners experience. But those days are over, mostly. Now, even iPhone users can realize their non-Apple Watch’s potential (or at least way more of it) thanks to Android Wear 2.0.  Just like with watches paired to an Android phone, iOS users will now be able to download native apps from the integrated Play Store, and reap all of the other benefits of the new software. It remains to be seen if Android users will be treated to new features first, but Google has lowered the divide a great deal. One of the few remaining obstacles is, of course, iMessages and other Apple-specific apps; although when (not if) Google launches Allo for Android Wear 2.0, that will be a good option for cross-communication between iOS and Android users.   Oh, and we're sure you were curious about which watches will receive the update. Here’s the rather exhaustive list of Android Wear 2.0 compatible smartwatches . Apps Apps are thankfully no longer an afterthought for Android Wear – and better yet, many more of them don’t require you to have your phone nearby, or even paired up with your watch over Bluetooth. While you do need to perform the initial pairing with your compatible smartphone (iOS 8.2 or Android 4.3 and above), the Style is leash-free so long as you remain under the umbrella of a Wi-Fi hotspot. This is thanks to the fact that Android Wear 2.0 copies your Google account to the watch, bringing along your downloaded apps, music, text message history and Google Assistant preferences. Of course, if you choose to roam outside and dig into Google Maps, which is one of the few apps that have received a fresh coat of paint for the new software launch, you’ll need to pair up with your phone for accurate tracking – something that the LG Watch Sport can do all on its own through inbuilt GPS and data chips. Google has told  us that it’s working with numerous developers to ensure that the Play Store has more than enough native apps at launch to keep users busy. For starters, expect to see Facebook Messenger, Glide, Google Messenger, Hangouts, Telegram and WhatsApp coming in for messaging.  In addition, AccuWeather, Bring!, Foursquare, Google Fit , Google Messenger, Google Play Music, Lifesum, Robinhood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Telegram, Uber and many more are on their way – and the list will only grow.   But building the app catalog will be an uphill climb, especially when watchOS from Apple is definitely ahead in terms of native apps. It’s worth noting that the LG Watch Style’s hardware may hamper the types of apps you can use. For example, it unfortunately doesn’t feature a built-in speaker, so you won’t be able to take a call. Also, if you were hoping for an Android Pay-ready smartwatch, you’ll want to direct your attention once again to the LG Watch Sport .     But those functions aren't ubiquitous in smartwatches yet, and the Style and many previously released smartwatches will be compatible with most of what the Play Store has to offer. But it’s important to consider, given that not all Android Wear smartwatches are created equal. Battery life “ How big could the battery be ?” we asked ourselves worriedly as we took the stylish LG Watch Style out of its box. As it turns out, not very big at all.  At 240mAh, it’s on the small side as far as battery capacities go in a smartwatch, and it shows. Obviously, the more you use the watch, the less time it will last. And during much of our testing period, we were flicking our wrist around at least once every few minutes. Under that sort of use, we were reaching for a charger before the day came to an end. On the last day of testing, though, we left it alone for the most part, and even with a steady stream of notifications coming in and text messages going out, it easily lasted the whole day. On the one hand, the battery life is no better than it was before, which is hugely disappointing. The Snapdragon Wear 2100 was supposed to change all of that.   But on the other hand we're able to do so much more with the watch while it’s alive that the disappointment is more or less asuaged. A life full is better than a life long, right? That’s not to say that it pleases us to carry around the conductive charger everywhere we go, but this seems to be the price we have to pay after we all loudly demanded thinner and more capable watches last year. Optimists that we are, we won’t rule out the possibility that Google could improve efficiency in future updates to Android Wear 2.0 – but we could very well be seeing the hard limitations of modern battery tech. Once the Style is placed on the puck-like charging dock it can charge halfway in about 40 minutes, and fully in about an hour and a half. LG is no stranger to Android Wear. Its previous smartwatches are among the best around to date, and the LG Watch Style strengthens that pedigree. The LG Watch Sport fills in some of the blanks in the hardware department and, by extension, adds some crucial functionality for hyper-connected people, fitness gurus and Android Pay fans. That said, the LG Watch Style is undeniably a more fashionable device, and cheaper to boot. As this smartwatch was built in close collaboration with Google you can expect its best qualities to set the precedent for what we're likely to see more of this year. And – good news – what's here is more or less exactly what we'd hoped to see. But some of the familiar pain points of Android Wear, like the worse-than-expected battery life, are here, and unfortunately not likely to go away any time soon.  Who's this for? The LG Watch Style is the thinnest Android Wear smartwatch yet at 10.8mm, which alone is enough for some to spring for LG’s latest. But if you need convincing, there are certainly more reasons to be interested. It’s easily the most striking Android Wear smartwatch out there, and will appeal to fashionistas as well as those who don't have time for excess in design. It’s also one of the first non-Apple Watches to essentially be fully compatible with iOS – just one of many perks to be found in Google’s new OS version.  Should you buy it? The Style proves that LG has its finger on the pulse, listening to what customers want in a smartwatch. And with Google’s help, it's had the opportunity to put into practice what it's learned before anyone else. However, it’s entirely possible that its competitors are listening just as carefully, and could outshine LG’s stylish smartwatch before 2017 is half over. If this is your first smartwatch, the value here is exceptional for the $249 (UK and AU price still to be officially compared, but convert to £200 / AU$325) price tag. Although many current smartwatches will be treated to the new Android Wear 2.0 software, that chances are good that LG’s latest is both better looking and slightly more capable with its slick, twistable crown. That goes double for iPhone owners. If you’re looking for a cheaper and more traditional-looking alternative to the Apple Watch, you probably just found it.  Tags: lg watch style LG Google Android Wear ios Android Wear 2.0 android wear Follow Techradar onfacebookLiketwitterFollowgplusFollow Contribute to TechradarWrite for Us More from this author The best fitness trackers for 2017 LG V20 Why new Chromebooks make Android tablets completely irrelevant Why I'm going to buy the Samsung Galaxy S8, even after the Note 7 disaster Related Stories LG Watch Style and Watch Sport with Android Wear 2.0 now official Google delays major Android Wear 2.0 update to 2017 LG looks set to launch two Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches on February 9 This might be our first look at Google and LG's Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches Google confirms two Android Wear 2.0 flagship smartwatches for early 2017 Android Wear just updated your wrist with...

Twitter Facebook Here's how Evernote moved 3 petabytes of data to Google's cloud 70 days, 5 billion notes, 12 billion files, and a whole lot of engineering work Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 09 February, 2017 04:28 - - - - print email Comments Evernote decided last year that it wanted to move away from running its own data centers and start using the public cloud to operate its popular note-taking service. On Wednesday, it announced that the lion's share of the work is done, save for some last user attachments. The company signed up to work with Google, and as part of the migration process, the tech titan sent a team of engineers (in one case, bearing doughnuts) over to work with its customer on making sure the process was a success. Evernote wanted to take advantage of the cloud to help with features based on machine learning that it has been developing. It also wanted to leverage the flexibility that comes from not having to run a data center. The move is part of a broader trend of companies moving their workloads away from data centers that they own and increasingly using public cloud providers. While the transition required plenty of work and adaptation, Evernote credited Google for pitching in to help with the migration. Why move to the cloud? There was definitely plenty of work to do. Evernote’s backend was built on the assumption that its application would be running on the company’s twin California data centers, not in a public cloud. So why go through all the work? Many of the key drivers behind the move will be familiar to cloud devotees. Evernote employees had to spend time maintaining the company’s data center, doing things like replacing hard drives, moving cables and evaluating new infrastructure options. While those functions were key to maintaining the overall health and performance of the Evernote service, they weren’t providing additional value to customers, according to Ben McCormack, the company’s vice president of operations. “We were just very realistic that with a team the size of Evernote’s operations team, we couldn’t compete with the level of maturity that the cloud providers have got…on provisioning, on management systems, et cetera,” McCormack said.“ We were always going to be playing catch-up, and it’s just a crazy situation to be in.” When Evernote employees thought about refreshing a data center, one of the key issues that they encountered is that they didn’t know what they would need from a data center in five years, McCormack said. Evernote had several public cloud providers it could choose from, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which are both larger players in the public cloud market. But McCormack said the similarities between the company’s current focus and Google’s areas of expertise were important to the choice. Evernote houses a large amount of unstructured data, and the company is looking to do more with machine learning. “You add those two together, Google is the leader in that space,” McCormack said. “So effectively, I would say, we were making a strategic decision and a strategic bet that the areas that are important to Evernote today, and the areas we think will be important in the future, are the same areas that Google excels in.” Machine learning was a highlight of Google’s platform for Evernote CTO Anirban Kundu, who said that higher-level services offered by Google help provide the foundation for new and improved features. Evernote has been driving toward a set of new capabilities based on machine learning, and Google services like its Cloud Machine Learning API help with that. While cost is often touted as a benefit of cloud migrations, McCormack said that it wasn’t a primary driver of Evernote’s migration. While the company will be getting some savings out of the move, he said that cost wasn’t a limitation for the transition. The decision to go with Google over another provider like AWS or Azure was driven by the technology team at Evernote, according to Greg Chiemingo, the company’s senior director of communications. He said in an email that CEO Chris O’Neill, who was at Google for roughly a decade before joining Evernote, came in to help with negotiations after the decision was made. How it happened Once Evernote signed its contract with Google in October, the clock was ticking. McCormack said that the company wanted to get the migration done before the new year, when users looking to get their life on track hammer the service with a flurry of activity. Before the start of the year, Evernote needed to migrate 5 billion notes and 5 billion attachments. Because of metadata, like thumbnail images, included with those attachments, McCormack said that the company had to migrate 12 billion attachment files. Not only that, but the team couldn’t lose any of the roughly 3 petabytes of data it had. Oh yeah, and the Evernote service needed to stay up the entire time. McCormack said that one of the Evernote team’s initial considerations was figuring out what core parts of its application could be entirely lifted and shifted into Google’s cloud, and what components would need to be modified in some way as part of the transition. Part of the transformation involved reworking the way that the Evernote service handled networking. It previously used UDP Multicast to handle part of its image recognition workflow, which worked well in the company’s own data center where it could control the network routers involved. But that same technology wasn’t available in Google’s cloud. Kundu said Evernote had to rework its application to use a queue-based model leveraging Google’s Cloud Pub/Sub service, instead. Evernote couldn’t just migrate all of its user data over and then flip a switch directing traffic from its on-premises servers to Google’s cloud in one fell swoop. Instead, the company had to rearchitect its backend application to handle a staged migration with some data stored in different places. The good news is that the transition didn’t require changes to the client. Kundu said that was key to the success of Evernote’s migration, because not all of the service’s users upgrade their software in a timely manner. Evernote’s engagement with Google engineers was a pleasant surprise to McCormack. The team was available 24/7 to handle Evernote’s concerns remotely, and Google also sent a team of its engineers over to Evernote’s facilities to help with the migration. Those Google employees were around to help troubleshoot any technical challenges Evernote was having with the move. That sort of engineer-to-engineer engagement is something Google says is a big part of its approach to service. For one particularly important part of the migration, Google’s engineers came on a Sunday, bearing doughnuts for all in attendance. More than that, however, McCormack said that he was impressed with the engineers’ collaborative spirit. “We had times when…we had written code to interface with Google Cloud Storage, we had [Google] engineers who were peer-reviewing that code, giving feedback and it genuinely felt like a partnership, which you very rarely see,” McCormack said. “Google wanted to see us be successful, and were willing to help across the boundaries to help us get there.” In the end, it took roughly 70 days for the whole migration to take place from the signing of the contract to its final completion. The main part of the migration took place over a course of roughly 10 days in December, according to McCormack. Lessons learned If there was one thing Kundu and McCormack were crystal clear about, it’s that even the best-laid plans require a team that’s willing to adapt on the fly to a new environment. Evernote’s migration was a process of taking certain steps, evaluating what happened, and modifying the company’s approach in response to the situation they were presented with, even after doing extensive testing and simulation. Furthermore, they also pointed out that work on a migration doesn’t stop once all the bytes are loaded into the cloud. Even with extensive testing, the Evernote team encountered new constraints working in Google’s environment once it was being used in production and bombarded with activity from live Evernote users. For example, Google uses live migration techniques to move virtual machines from one host to another in order to apply patches and work around hardware issues. While that happens incredibly quickly, the Evernote service under full load had some problem with it, which required (and still requires) optimization. Kundu said that Evernote had tested live migration prior to making the switch over to GCP, but that wasn’t enough. When an application is put into production, user behavior and load on it might be different from test conditions, Kundu said. “And that’s where you have to be ready to handle those edge cases, and you have to realize that the day the migration happens or completes is not the day that you’re all done with the effort. You might see the problem in a month or whatever.” Another key lesson, in McCormack’s opinion, is that the cloud is ready to handle any sort of workload. Evernote evaluated a migration roughly once every year, and it was only about 13 months ago that the company felt confident a cloud transition would be successful. “Cloud has reached a maturity level and a breadth of features that means it’s unlikely that you’ll be unable to run in the cloud,” McCormack said. That’s not to say it doesn’t require effort. While the cloud does provide benefits to Evernote that the company wasn’t going to get from running its own data center, they still had to cede control of their environment, and be willing to lose some of the telemetry they’re used to getting from a private data center. Evernote’s engineers also did a lot of work on automating the transition. Moving users’ attachments over from the service’s on-premises infrastructure to Google Cloud Storage is handled by a pair of bespoke automated systems. The company used Puppet and Ansible for migrating the hundreds of shards holding user note data. The immediate benefits of a migration One of the key benefits of Evernote’s move to Google’s cloud is the company’s ability to provide reduced latency and improved connection consistency to its international customers. Evernote’s backend isn’t running in a geographically distributed manner right now, but Google’s worldwide networking investments provide an improvement right away. “We have seen page loading times reducing quite significantly across some parts of our application,” McCormack said. “I wouldn’t say it’s everywhere yet, but we are starting to see that benefit of the Google power and the Google reach in terms of bridging traffic over their global fiber network.” Right now, the company is still in the process of migrating the last of its users’ attachments to GCP. When that’s done, however, the company will be able to tell its users that all the data they have in the service is encrypted at rest, thanks to the capabilities of Google’s cloud. From an Evernote standpoint, the company’s engineers have increased freedom to get their work done using cloud services. Rather than having to deal with provisioning physical infrastructure to power new features, developers now have a whole menu of options when it comes to using new services for developing features. “Essentially, any GCP functionality that exists, they’re allowed to access, play with — within constraints of budget, obviously — and be able to build against.” In addition, the cloud provides the company with additional flexibility and peace of mind when it comes to backups, outages and failover. What comes next? Looking further out, the company is interested in taking advantage of some of Google’s existing and forthcoming services. Evernote is investigating how it can use Google Cloud Functions, which lets developers write snippets of code that then run in response to event triggers. Evernote is also alpha testing some Google Cloud Platform services that haven’t been released or revealed to the public yet. Kundu wouldn’t provide any details about those services. In a similar vein, Kundu wouldn’t go into details about future Evernote functionality yet. However, he said that there are “a couple” of new features that have been enabled as a result of the migration.

The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport are meant to reignite momentum around Android Wear, offering thin designs and robust functionality. After being rumoured in the summer of last year, Google's plans to work with LG on a pair of smartwatches were detailed this January. Today, the company formally introduced the two devices, describing its involvement in their creation as a "collaboration" with LG. LG Watch Sport The Sport is the most powerful of the pair, offering the most functionality in an Android Wear watch yet. There's on-board GPS for advanced exercise tracking, letting you precisely monitor your runs. Cellular connectivity is built into the watch too, reducing its reliance on a companion smartphone. Dedicated buttons link directly to Google Fit and Android Pay, reducing time at the checkout or while starting a workout. The circular touchscreen will be used for most other inputs but there's also a rotating power button to control key functions. The latter is clearly inspired by Apple's "digital crown" design. The Sport comes with an elastomer band that's meant to be comfortable while exercising as well as during everyday use. The watch is available in two colours, titanium and dark blue. LG Watch Style The Style is a scaled-back Sport that emphasises design and fashion above raw functionality. It's less powerful than the Sport, leaving out both NFC and GPS. There's a single physical button, the rotating home key that features on the Sport. The lack of dedicated controls for Android Pay and Google Fit could be a concern to some people but is unlikely to affect the Style's overall uptake. Three different designs with varying finishes are available, offering more options to suit your style. The watch is available in silver, rose gold and titanium colours, accompanied by a selection of 18mm leather and silicone bands. Android Wear 2.0 The Watch Sport and Watch Style are significant more for their software than hardware. Aside from being the first Android Wear watches made with input from Google, they're also the first to run version 2.0 of the platform. It's a substantial upgrade that considerably changes the functionality of the OS. Android Wear Google Apps can now be installed directly to the watch, improving performance and allowing you to leave your phone at home. It's possible to respond to messages without picking up your phone too. A selection of input options, including dictation, typing and handwriting, let you reply while on the go. This works for third-party apps including Facebook Messenger, Telegram and WhatsApp as well as Google's own line-up of communication services. Android Wear 2.0 also marks Google Assistant's first foray into wearables. You can ask Assistant questions by holding down the power button or saying "OK Google." It's currently available only in English and German but other languages will arrive "in the coming months." The LG Watch Style and Watch Sport will launch in the U.S. on Friday at AT&T, Verizon and the Google Store. An expansion to stores in Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the UAE and the UK will come in the next few weeks.

LG Watch Style vs Apple Watch 2: Which should you buy? by Joe Roberts 08 February 2017 0 shares Read Comments LG Watch Style vs Apple Watch 2: Google has teamed up with LG to deliver the first smartwatches to feature the new Android Wear 2.0 OS. But is it enough to stand out from the might Apple Watch 2? Here's all you need to know. The first Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches have arrived in the form of the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport – both designed in collaboration with Google. With smartwatches yet to fully enter the mainstream, has Google and LG's collaboration done enough to finally break the barrier? Well, before we start worrying about that, we might as well compare the LG Watch Style with the Apple Watch 2, right? To do so, here are the burning questions that need tackling: How are their designs different? Which has the better screen? How do they compare for performance and OS? When are they released and how much will they cost? Which of these smartwatches is best for you?If you're desperate to get an answer to that last question, head on down to the summary at the end. Otherwise, let the comparisons begin! Related: MWC 2017 LG Watch Style vs Apple Watch 2: How are their designs different? The LG Watch Style has been designed to appeal to those not necessarily interested in all the fitness elements that sportier wearables are (literally) weighed down by. According to LG, it's a "small, slim and stylish Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch that is cleverly designed for urban trendsetters." With its slim design, you should be able to set your "trends" with ease, thanks to the 10.79mm thickness. By comparison, the Apple Watch 2, which comes in a choice of 38mm or 42mm widths, is 11.4mm thick. LG's offering also comes in three different colour options: Silver, Titanium and Rose Gold, and, like the Apple Watch, allows you to use interchangeable "snap-and-swap" straps. Related: Apple Watch 2 vs Apple Watch The Watch Style is built from the same stainless steel as the Apple Watch 2, though you can also get the Apple Watch in a cheaper aluminium version. Unlike Apple's device, however, the Watch Style is only IP67 rated for waterproofing. That means it'll survive if you get caught in the rain, but you don't want to take it swimming with you. The Apple Watch, on the other hand, is water resistant down to 50m, and comes with some swim-tracking software, too. While the most obvious design difference between the two is the shape of the watch face – circular on the Watch Style, and a rounded rectangle on the Apple Watch – both feature a physical "crown" on the right-hand side. LG Watch Style vs Apple Watch 2: Which has the better screen? As mentioned, the LG Watch Style comes with a circular watch face, which gives it a resolution of 360 x 360 with a pixel density of 299ppi (pixels per inch). That should make for a pretty sharp picture on the 1.2-inch display. Apple's got LG beat in this department, however – although only slightly. The Apple Watch 42mm comes with a 1.65-inch display with a 390 x 312 resolution and a 303ppi density. That said, the 38mm version of the Apple Watch 2 comes with a lower pixel density of 290ppi. Related: Best smartwatch In reality, there should be very little difference between LG's and Apple's smartwatches in terms of display, especially considering that both use OLED technology. That means that each individual pixel emits its own lights, making for better energy efficiency and deeper blacks. Another slight difference between the two watches is the fact that LG has opted for Gorilla Glass 3 to protect its display, while the Apple has a sapphire crystal. LG Watch Style vs Apple Watch 2: How does their performance compare? The big selling point of the LG Watch Style is the fact that, along with the LG Watch Sport, it's the first smartwatch to come with the newly launched Android Wear 2.0 operating system. The OS comes with a load of extras including new Complications, which allows third-party apps to display information on the watch face itself. Notifications have been streamlined this time around, too, plus Google's Material Design has been applied to the whole thing, with the addition of an action and navigation drawer. Apple's wearable, on the other hand, runs watchOS 3, which now allows developers to keep their apps in the Apple Watch 2’s memory once opened, meaning they open up many times faster than before. There's also a ton of new watch faces, and the OS is, overall, a huge improvement over Apple's previous efforts. Which you prefer will largely depend on which you're most used to, and whether you have an iPhone or Android smartphone. One area that's easier to compare is the hardware itself. While LG's wearable comes with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor backed up by 512MB of RAM, Apple's Apple S2 chipset powers the Apple Watch 2, along with either 512GB or 1GB of RAM (this is yet to be confirmed). There's also built-in NFC in the Watch Style, so Android Pay can now be used with the wearable. These specs should make for speedy performance in both cases, although we're yet to test out the LG Watch Style. One benefit of using the LG Watch is that you'll be able to hook it up to either an iPhone or Android smartphone. Here's what LG has to say about it: “Another improvement which should open the device to a whole new range of potential wearers is that the watch is compatible with iOS. This means you can combine the benefits of an Apple smartphone with the excellence of LG’s cutting-edge wearable device, regardless of which OS your smartphone is running." Naturally, Apple wouldn't ever allow something as useful as that on its own smartwatch, so you'll need to own an iPhone to make use of the Apple Watch 2. Here's a full spec rundown: Apple Watch 2 (42mm) LG Watch Style Display 1.65-inch AMOLED – 390 x 312 pixels (303ppi) 1.2-inch P-OLED – 360 x 360 pixels (299ppi) Size 42.5 x 36.4 x 11.4 mm 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm Chipset Apple S2 Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 (1.1GHz) Materials Stainless Steel or Aluminium with Sapphire Crystal glass 316L Stainless Steel and Gorilla Glass 3 Straps Numerous styles available Italian Genuine Leather straps RAM 512MB or 1GB (TBC) 512MB Storage 4GB 4GB Battery Size Non-removable (up to 18 hours – claimed) 240mAh Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor, Heart-rate Sensor Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Colours Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver Silver, Titanium, Rose Gold Wireless Charging? Yes Yes Waterproof? Up to 50 metres IP67-certified LG Watch Style vs Apple Watch 2: What's their release date and pricing? Those of you over in the US will be able to get your hands on the LG Watch Style (and Sport) from February 10 for $249. Just head over to Best Buy or the Google Store to pick up the Style. LG has also confirmed that customers in the UK, Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, and the UAE will be able to purchase both watches at carriers and retailers “in the coming weeks”. The Apple Watch 2, of course, is already on sale. Prices start at £369/$369, which makes the LG seem very good value indeed. LG Watch Style vs Apple Watch 2: Conclusion If you're rocking an Android phone, the LG is the obvious choice here. We're yet to try out the LG Watch Style, so obviously we can't say for sure whether it's as good as the Apple, but the LG is the only one of the two to work with both Android and iOS. It seems Google and LG have done a decent job of providing a sleek-looking, functional smartwatch, but at this point it's too early to say for sure. iPhone owners and keen swimmers should probably stick with Apple. The Apple Watch 2's better water resistance makes it more versatile for people who want a smartwatch for both the office and the gym. Also, history tells us that, even though the LG works with iPhones, you'll get a more seamless experience by sticking to the Apple ecosystem. We'll have a more certain conclusion once we've got our hands on the LG Watch Style, so stay tuned.

However, I still prefer the Gear 3 best looking of them all and I love the bezel control, smooth lag free operation and tons of great watch faces.

But it’s also coming to a pretty big list of existing Android Wear watches — and future smartwatch releases (though fewer than you might think, since HTC and Motorola have officially bowed out of making them for the time being). If you have one of those watches, you’ll probably want this upgrade, which is slowly rolling out over the next few months. If you don’t have them — will Android Wear 2.0 be the thing that convinces you? Well, no, probably not. But that’s okay — if we’ve learned anything over the past year it’s that smartwatches have found their purpose. They’re mostly good for notifications, fitness tracking, and little bits of information on the watchface. If that sounds useful to you, you will be happy to learn that Android Wear 2.0 is better than ever at them, arguably on par with the Apple Watch in some cases. These watches can almost live without your phone The big news with Android Wear 2.0 is that these watches are moving ever closer to becoming standalone devices. They’ll work with either Android phones or iPhones, and because they have their own Wi-Fi (and sometimes LTE!), they can go on and get apps and do stuff even if they’re paired to Apple’s locked-down devices. (The biggest thing Android Wear 2.0 can’t do is work with iMessage.) We’ll have a full review of the software soon, but for now think of it this way: it’s gone from being a teenager with a learner’s permit to having a real driver’s license. It’s not quite all grown up and ready to face the world, but it’s at least able to handle itself without needing constant supervision. So here are our favorite features of Android Wear 2.0. Some of them are kind of surprising — who knew a tiny keyboard would actually work in a pinch? Simpler navigation If there’s a big theme with smartwatches in the past year, it’s that their first incarnations were way, way too complicated. Apple figured this out the hard way — having to pare down its initial, high-flying claims about the future of wearable computing to something a little more simple. Google, luckily, never promised that Android Wear would change the entire world. But it did make a UI that gave us way too many options: long-press for one thing, swipe over for another, swipe again for contacts, swipe down for this, up for that, and so on and so on. It was easy to forget what to do and how to do it. With 2.0, Wear is a lot simpler. Swiping left and right switches watchfaces, which is easier and something you’ll want to do more often. Swiping up brings up your notifications, swiping down a little setting shade. You hit the main button to launch the simple app list or long-press it to launch Google Assistant. And that’s kind of it — if you want to do something more complicated, you can launch an app or set something as a custom complication on your watchface. The new UI focuses Wear down to just the stuff that people actually want to do with a smartwatch, and leaves the harder stuff out of your way. It’s there for people who want to set it up, but totally ignorable for people who don’t want to bother. Last but not least, Wear 2.0 supports “rotational” input, in case your watch has a crown you want to spin or a watch bezel you want to twirl. Customizable watchfaces Android Wear has always had an advantage over the Apple Watch in that you could download and use any number of third-party watchfaces. And despite (or maybe because) of the thousands of options, finding the right one was always a little difficult. Some were too nerdy or just too ugly, most were about 10 degrees off from what you really want. So you’d end up installing one of several apps that let you create your own — and in the process discover that your ability to design a nice-looking watchface was far exceeded by your ability to see that you are not a designer. And so you got ugly watchfaces. With Wear 2.0, you can customize the in-built watchfaces directly from the watch, and there are way more options than there used to be. You can easily change colors, complications, backgrounds, and much more. It will probably take a minute for watchface designers to release faces that work with the new system, but when they do we should be able to have round watchfaces that actually look decent while giving us the information we want — all without requiring a degree in both computer engineering and graphic design. Third-party complications This is the big deal for a lot of Android Wear users. As with custom watchfaces, it always seemed like you could get this close to designing the face that you want on your own, only to have some critical element like the weather, time zones, steps, or something else missing. All that should be fixed now. App developers can make complications available to any watchface, and they can both display information and launch apps. In lieu of an impossible (and impossibly slow) contact list, you can just put your favorite contacts right in a complication to send them a quick text. We’ve only been able to test out a handful of these complications, but they work like they’re supposed to. They’re little circles of key information, displayed decently. Hopefully more will be on their way soon. The best part? They work when the screen is in ambient mode, so you can always see them. Apps without your phone This might seem like a weird thing to be excited about, but having the Google Play Android app store directly on the watch is a Big Deal. It means that iPhone users will be able to do much more on their smartwatches without getting blocked by Apple’s restrictions. Because these smartwatches are just Android devices, they don’t have to follow Apple’s rules if they’re paired to an iPhone. There are benefits for Android users, too: namely you can choose which apps you want on your watch separately from what’s on your phone. So for me, I have The Weather Channel installed on my watch because it offers a watchface complication, but Dark Sky on my phone because I prefer its rain alerts. And I can finally (finally!) avoid having Delta’s hot garbage smartwatch app installed on my watch. Good riddance tiny QR code that I will never use taking over my watch screen. Oh, and browsing or searching for apps directly on the watchface is as awkward and weird as you would guess. But the good news is you don’t have to do it on the watch. You can just go to the Google Play website on your desktop, find the app you want on your watch, and click a button there to have it installed on its own. Google Fit seems way better Now that Google has figured out what people actually want to do with their smartwatches, it’s beefing up one of the most important features: fitness. Google Fit on Wear 2.0 has a bunch of new exercise options, and some of them even offer guided “challenges.” Select “Push-up challenge” or “Squat challenge” and the watch will show you a little animation of the proper form and then monitor your actual exercise with its motion sensors. More sensor options than ever Watch makers have just a boggling number of connectivity options when they make Android Wear 2.0 devices. These smartwatches all have Bluetooth, of course, but they can also feature Wi-Fi, LTE, GPS, NFC, and heart rate sensors. Maybe more. Google says that Android Wear will automatically select the best internet connectivity option available to it, depending on the circumstance. Sometimes that’ll be Bluetooth from your phone, sometimes it’ll just straight up be LTE directly from the watch. LG’s Sport and Style smartwatches are basically at the two extreme ends of the spectrum. The Sport is a beast with everything possible in it, including LTE for streaming music during your run so you don’t have to fuss with remembering to load up the smartwatch with songs before you set out. (It will also let you make calls and send texts — and on some carriers it’ll do so with the same phone number as your phone.) The Style, on the other hand, is bare-bones. It has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, but nothing else. That keeps it skinny, but it also means you’re not going to be making any Android Pay transactions with it. Sending messages Replying to message is a key part of a smartwatch, and Google has done a good job of improving those tools in Wear 2.0. For apps custom-designed for Wear, you can tap a little reply button right in the notification. For the rest, you can still reply with a tap and a swipe (it uses whatever it built into your phone’s notification tray). iPhone users will have fewer options. But when it comes time to actually send the message, Google is using the “Smart Reply” feature we’ve seen in Inbox and Allo. The default replies are contextually aware — so Slack replies are more likely to be about work and messaging replies sent at the end of the working day are more likely to be about agreeing to go to the store to pick up milk. Want to compose your own message? Google has included two text-entry options above and beyond what was already there (voice input and emoji). You can draw out characters and it works pretty accurately. But the biggest surprise is there’s an option to use an itty-bitty QWERTY keyboard. It seems ridiculous (it’s kind of ridiculous), but instead of tapping at insanely tiny keys you swipe your finger to type in the words. And... it’s accurate — like shockingly accurate, and we found ourselves actually using this dinky little keyboard way more than we expected.

My guest today is Manoush Zomorodi, the Host of Note to Self that's produced by WNYC Studios. She just launched a new project called The Privacy Paradox, and we're going to talk about privacy, digital media, and the government. We are also going to make sure you know all of the things your phone knows about you. Dan Costa: Before we get into The Privacy Paradox itself, let's talk about what you do because you are a radio personality. You've got a podcast, so it goes out as a podcast as well. You can listen to it online. But then you do these experiments that are not what people might expect from a radio show Manoush Zomorodi: No, they're a little weird. Explain this process of these experiments, these engagements. Okay, so this is the third year that we're doing it. The last two Januaries, what we've done is we've taken a concept, and we've asked people, "Join us for one week, try a behavior change, and see what happens." For the first one, it was called Boredom Brilliant. We had 20,000 people sign up and sort of rethink how they use their phone. We asked them to put their phone down a little bit to try and get bored because I went down this rabbit hole where I was like, "Wait, what happens when we get bored?" I don't think I ever get bored anymore because I have my phone. We ask people to purposefully make time to get bored for a week to see if it would jump-start their creativity, and it worked. Dan, like my favorite comments, were the teenagers who were like, "You know, I don't think I've ever had this sensation before." Because if you think about it, they've had phones their whole lives. They don't know what being bored is actually ... They've never stood in a line and not been able to talk to their friends. Right, without anything to do, had to space out. They've never had to let their minds wander. We did that for a week. It was great. People were really into it. There's a book coming out in September. That was Boredom Brilliant. And then last year we did something called Infomagical. Again, it was a week of every day, a different challenge. What we were trying to do was help people deal with their information overload. This idea that I certainly had every night of just mindlessly scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. I was wondering, how much of this information do I retain in my brain? We talked, again, to neuroscientists, cognitive psychologists, technologists about what the brain can do, how we can use our technology to help us, to enhance our lives rather than like make us feel like drooling idiots at the end of the day. That was great. That was 40,000 people, again, for a week. We made all these behavior changes, and 70% of them said that they felt they were able to handle information overload better than before. Of course, you know, this was last January. It feels like a million years ago because we weren't even talking about echo chambers and filter bubbles and ... Pre-election. .. alternative facts and all of those things. I feel like we need to reprise that one. Yeah, you do. And then here we are again. It's January, and, I mean, it feels like so long ago when I started thinking about this one, The Privacy Paradox, which is more about our digital civil liberties, which ended up being incredibly timely, but not in the way I had expected it to be. I sort of thought this was like in a post-Ed Snowden thing. I also really wanted to talk about this idea of the ad-based economy, the surveillance economy, as some of the experts I spoke to described it to me. It's been a weird couple weeks, and so I feel like people feel a little like, "Ah, what do I ... I can't walk away from breaking news." But actually, I think what we're finding is that people want to sign up for this week of challenges, which is next week, because it's simple, easy, constructive things that they can try every day, and you can do something. You've got the expert sources, traditional reporting, and then you've got all these people doing these experiments and giving you feedback. Giving us feedback, that's the key. That feedback then gets wrapped into your story, too. Yes, exactly. You've got real people that are living it in real time. That's going to happen next week. If somebody misses that first day or two, they'll still be able to catch up. Exactly. What we've had it is that you can do Infomagical, for example ... Like, today you could sign up for it. It triggers. I mean, ideally, you do it with ... You know, you wake up in the morning and you think to yourself, "Wow, tens of thousands of other people are waking up right now, and we're all going to do this weird thing today," and there's a sort of collective community element to it in addition to the on-demand element to it. I'm trying to get the best of both worlds. What was a real surprise to me with these projects is that at the end, we have had so many clinical researchers come to us and say, "Uh, can you share your data with us? Because we think it might help us figure out what we need to be studying as we go forward." I'm like, "Yeah, our data's semi-scientific. It is not ... You know, we don't have a control group. We're not doing it ... certainly not in a lab like this one." They are , I think, looking to people boots on the ground of how technology's changing us as human beings and where they need to be going regarding the actual published research going forward. The Privacy Paradox is a phrase that you sort of intuitively know what it means. But I don't think I've ever heard that phrase before. It perfectly encapsulates what you're talking about. Well, I'd heard the phrase, and then I dug into it. This is a phrase, the privacy paradox, that behavioral economists use, specifically at Carnegie Mellon. They like to throw this one around. Are they claiming ownership? They do. They're allowed to. The idea is that, like, actually, no matter what you hear about millennials telling the most intimate things on Instagram, it's not true. Americans value their privacy immensely. 74% of Americans, this was according to Pew Research, say that it is extremely important to them that they control who has ownership of their personal information and data. Then what happens, though, every day, you know how it is, it's ... They give it away. They give it away. Exactly. The question if we care so much about it, why are we giving it away? You know, it's really not the consumer's fault. It is ... You cannot be a person in the world in 2017 and not be on these platforms. For example, one woman was like ... she, a listener, emailed me, was like, "Well, I'm going back to work. I was a stay-at-home mom. I need to be relevant. I need to be searchable. I used to be really protective of my privacy, and I can't be because I need to get a job. So how do I balance these two things, which is providing for my family, but also, like, a fundamental belief that I shouldn't have to reveal too much?" allowfullscreen</span> <spanwebkitallowfullscreen</span> <spanmozallowfullscreen</span> <spanoallowfullscreen</span> msallowfullscreen> Let's touch on this idea that surveillance economy powers and pays for so much of our digital lives—it is all driven by personal information. Data power it. Not just any data, it's your private information. It drives Google. It drives Facebook. It drives every media site that's out there, including PCMag.com. That is our advertising model. It's why we can create free content. It's why Facebook can create a free service. It's why we have this great free search engine that indexes the entire world. Why do you want to mess with that? Well, you know, I will say, what I found interesting I didn't quite understand. Shoshana Zuboff ... I'm like name dropping all kinds of people for you today, Dan. She is a retired Harvard researcher. She's like at the nexus of this and coined that term "surveillance economy." It's one thing if you're like, "Okay, here's my Social Security number." That's obvious that's personal information. But she talks about the digital exhaust that each of us or digital breadcrumbs. It's not the data, per se, but it's the metadata. It's not the phone call I made, but what time I made the phone call, where I was when I made the phone call. That it's our behavior that is being used, and we don't have control over that. I'm perfectly fine with giving ... You know, we make that trade off every day, right? The privacy calculus, which is like, "Fine, I will give you all my personal information as long as you give me a great product, a free product, a very personalized product." All of us are going to ... You know, I might be more vigilant about that than somebody else, but at least I should know what you're using my information for, and at least I should have the option of deciding to take it back, which I can't. Once it's out there, that's it. Facebook has it forever. As you surveyed the landscape, did you find that there are enough privacy controls? Like, there are privacy controls on Facebook. Most people don't know how to use them. Is it that there are controls that out there and people aren't using them, or is it that ultimately you don't have a lot of control in whether Facebook or Amazon or Apple or Microsoft have all this information about you? Well, I mean, there's one study that says it would take us 22 days a year to read all the terms of service that we ... for every website that we go on. Don't bother reading them. There's no point. The legalese is perfectly written in ... For lawyers. .... incomprehensible ways. Exactly, to make no sense whatsoever. Also, I think it's we don't ... How can we agree to things that we don't know are happening? For example, our friends at ProPublica did a great investigative research that found that Facebook has over 52,000 categories that they put their users in. A category, one was breastfeeding in public. Another was pretending to text awkwardly. Another one was grass, and I'm not sure if that was this kind, or like walk with your shoes off kind. I'm really not sure. In addition to, of course, your income, what gender you say you ... you know, all of those things that you tell them. It also watches wherever else you are, and then puts you in all these different categories, which is fine. You're like, "Oh, it's just advertising," but there are some weird categories also, like ethnic affinity. They could say, "Dan Costa has an Asian-American ethnic affinity," which is kind of weird. They would show you things that they think you like ... Don't judge me. Absolutely. This is a judge-free space. Let's get a question in from the audience. Audience: How concerned should we be about always-listening voice assistants, like Alexa? I'm freaked out by Alexa. Do you have an Alexa? I absolutely do not have an Alexa. Really? No way. She's amazing. She makes your life better. This is good. This is . Tell me about how great Alexa is. Alexa is amazing. First of all, I don't want some woman that I'm bossing around in my house. Like, not setting a good ... Again, I feel a little judgment. I mean, it's hard to describe what she does when you bring her home, but just that voice-based interface, to be able to ask for things and have her deliver them. It's the same ... you ask the same questions you would ask for if you were typing on your phone or if you're at your keyboard, but being able to do it hands-free is very liberating. Here's my problem, okay. Just last month, law enforcement asked Amazon to hand over the recordings that Alexa had made in the home of an alleged murderer. Now, no judgment on the alleged murderer, of course, but we're at a point where there are no legal protections for any of this stuff. It's a fascinating case. It is a fascinating case. It wasn't necessarily that Alexa would have recordings of everything that happened in the house. But if he had been asking for things like ...Paper towels, maybe? Or where can I buy black plastic bags? And gloves. And latex gloves. Oh, we shouldn't laugh. This is terrible. Those types of searches would be in the hits. If he did it on a desktop, those searches would also be findable and observable. I mean, we're at this point, though, Dan. I think, to me, the point is like there are no laws. There's nothing. There's no regulation. Nobody has any say. We also don't even like ... Another one that I was reading about was, have you heard about ... We're doing ... Should I give it away? I think you should. Okay, it's a tool we're going to ask people to try next week. It's called Apply Magic Sauce. Do you know this one? I do not. Oh my god, it's unbelievable. It will look at your Facebook profile, and it will predict your personality. There's a great piece in Motherboard Today written by these German reporters saying that, was technology similar to Apply Magic Sauce from Cambridge Analytica used maybe to see what people's personalities were on Facebook? It looks at your Facebook profile ... I mean, you figure it could do a bunch of things like, you know, are you using curse words? Are you writing about certain products? Are you positive or negative? What's your punctuation? How do you construct sentences? What words do you use? It called me 94% more hard working and organized than the rest of the population. Not 93%, 94, based on something I had written. Did you find that accurate? Do you think that's an accurate assessment? Well, that's the question, right? I don't know if it's accurate. Or is that my, you know ... to get like deep and so like psychoanalysis ... or is that my externalization of my personality? Is that okay that they're not reading what I write, but they're reading between the lines and then showing me things based on that? They don't tell me that in the privacy settings. We don't know if that's being used. I think that's a really interesting point because there's obviously a lot of anxiety. People are very ... people are weirded out by this technology. Yes. Creepy. Because they're just trying to wrap their heads around it. I mean, if you take it and you go to the flip side, and you go, "Well, what does it matter?" What is at stake here? What are you afraid of happening? What are you afraid of being put into one of these buckets? What's the worse thing that happens? Right. Well, I put that exact question to ... There's this great guy, Joseph Turow; he's at the University of Pennsylvania. He has studied marketing for decades, and his whole thing is, you are rehearsing right now to not have any privacy in your life at all. The Fourth Amendment, baby. The word privacy is not used, but it is what makes us Americans, this right to have self-determination, autonomy, free will. I mean, I feel like we're at a point where we have to go back to basics. What did we see at the airport over the weekend? We saw customs officials asking people to hand over their phones to show them their Twitter accounts before they entered this country. I think ... Customs has been using social media profiles for a while. Have they? Domestically and internationally. Oh, I didn't know that. When that customs guy's sitting behind the desk, and he calls up your information, if you have you have a public account, it has that information up there. Who gets to decide what I've written is "unacceptable," quote? I think the thing that what your show is doing, and what we've been talking about a lot of about, is that individuals need to be aware: what they put out there is not going to stay in one place. If it's public and it's online, it's going to be searchable, and it's going to be analyzable. Not just one at a time, but in mass. Professor Turow said to me, he's like, "I mean, at the very least, we need to go from creepy to crappy," because if it's crappy, at least we understand it, and maybe we can try to do something about it. Creepy, we just don't even understand how it works, and that doesn't seem ... Like, we're using these things all day long. We should have a little bit more knowledge as to how they work and where our personal information is going. You get into that in The Privacy Paradox. You reveal how a lot of these things work. Yes, exactly. Let's get another question in from the audience. Audience Will we just learn to accept future millennial politicians having unseemly things coming back from their distant digital pasts? I mean, if Access Hollywood can find it, I mean, does it matter? As we saw, you can dig up the files, and it doesn't seem to matter. Trump was a public figure, and he was getting ready for a media hit. He knew there were cameras and microphones on the bus. The larger question is that there's a whole generation that's had cameras on them since they were ten years old. Digital photos don't go anywhere. They're in these vast Google Photos libraries and uploaded in the cloud, and you can see people that have college photos. Like, there are no pictures of me from college. No, me neither. Thank God. They would have to be photos from . Somebody's going to find some right now, by the way. But now, anybody in the last ten years, there are pictures of them from college at every moment. That's going to stay with them forever. Maybe we are just going to get used to that. I mean, that's what's so interesting to me, is that things that we have taken for granted for millennia ... like boredom, for example ... now, these are things that we have to name and introduce to a generation that will not have experienced it. So, for like the European right to be forgotten ... like forgetting. Remembering used to be like ... You know what I mean? Forgetting used to be a human thing, but now we have to have a European Union ruling, and tech companies have to comply to ... It just used to be part of the human experience, so it's interesting to me we're learning which of those things, like, "Okay, it's fine it's gone," and other ones are like, "Oh, crap." That really messes with society when there's no forgetting anything. I'm not ... I don't ... This is a Black Mirror episode. Yeah, well, we're in it. Let's say somebody doesn't want to accept these terms. You want to reject the terms and conditions of Facebook, of Apple, of carrying a smartphone everywhere, what recourse do consumers have? Is it either in or out? I don't think it is at all. I think that's unreasonable to ask. Do you know what I mean? I use Google Docs. You have to function. We want to ask people, decide for yourself, you know, so you don't feel icky all day ... You know, that feeling when you're like, "Ah, I agree, I agree." Don't feel icky. Actually, I'm going to reveal this. At the end of the project, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, actually sits down with us and writes personal terms of service. Just sort of codify what you're okay with- For himself. This is what he's okay with; this is what he's not okay with. We have made a fill-in-the-blank, like Mad Libs, for everyone to do. It's not like, "Oh, wait, is this one okay and this one's not?" No. You'll have it with you. Maybe, I don't know, print it out. Use it as your screensaver. Like, "Privacy is blank to ... " No judgment. For some people, I think it'll be like, "Oh, I am out." There will be people, and my listeners have told me that. Other people are like, "You know what? I'm okay with this company, maybe Apple, because they do take a stand on privacy, but I'm not okay with maybe ... " I don't want to name names. You know, other folks. What are your personal privacy limits? You carry a cell phone, but you have no interest in Alexa? When you sign up for The Privacy Paradox, we've recreated a quiz. There's this dude, Alan Weston; he is the man, when it comes to people's feelings about privacy. We have taken his very scientific work and turned it into a fun quiz. There you go. Because that's what we do. I'm dying to know what you are. You take the quiz, and it tells you whether you are a believer, a realist, or a shrugger. I'm a realist. You're a realist. For sure. I'm definitely a realist, too. I mean, every time I download an app, and I look at the permissions, I look at them, and I decide, "Is there any reason this app needs my GPS? Does it need access to my microphone? Does it have access to the hard drive?" And I will make a decision. There are plenty of apps I just ... If it's just a junky app that doesn't add any value to my life ... See ya. ... I just pass by it. Yep. Yep. I mean, keeping in mind, you're the executive editor of PC Mag. Totally. Okay. Normal, everyday people should be able to do that. We had an event last night, and we asked people to do that. Like, look at your apps. If there's an app that's asking you for access to your microphone, but they don't have anything to do with voice, why should they have it? Turn it off. And then people are like, "Oh." You know? I'll tell ya, for app developers, the default is to get access to everything. Of course. Because they may want a feature later on, and they want to grow into the app, but their default, they assume most people will just click through. And they do. Right, right. That makes sense to me. They want as much information as possible. Sir Tim Berners-Lee ... Have you heard about this? He's working- I've heard of him, yes. No, no, what he's working on. No. These personal data storage, they're pods, this like ... Flipping what the web is. The idea would be like instead of you logging into Facebook; Facebook would log into you. You would grant them whatever information you felt okay with, and you would also be able to take it back whatever you wanted. That way you have your terms of service. And Facebook needs to comply with your terms of service instead of-of you having to comply with theirs. They don't want to comply with your terms; then they can't access your personal information. Precisely. It's a project at MIT. It's called Solid. He is looking for developers to help him. At first, I was like, "Oh my god, this is crazy town," but then you're like, "Well, this guy invented the web ... " He did it once…. ... so if anyone could do it again … We got another question from the audience. Audience Should I trust Windows 10? Manoush Zomorodi: What do you think, Dan? Dan Costa: I think you can trust Windows 10 as much as you trust any operating system. Microsoft itself, I don't think it's not anything inherently untrustworthy. When it comes to privacy concerns, I think there's so much other stuff going on. I think ... And there's Google's whole platform, but the thing that worries me is all the advertisers. It's third parties and companies that are tracking and then reselling your data, and that's where there's not a lot of regulation. That's not a Microsoft thing. It's not a Google thing. It's this third-party market that operates completely under everybody's radar. Which, I mean, goes back decades, right, in this country to junk mail, to people selling and swapping. I didn't know this, but ProPublica, Julia Angwin, the investigative reporter, was telling me that actually, Facebook is the biggest purchaser of the six big data firms, that they spend the most money not only taking the information you put into Facebook as a user but then also purchasing information about you from the big data collection companies. And the matching that goes on in that background where even if you give Facebook ... you know, you lock everything down on Facebook, you're on the service, but all they really know is your email address, they will then take that email address and match it to a cookie, match it to your credit report, because all the credit report agencies, they distribute all this information as well. There's this huge network of databases back there. You don't even have to give your information to Facebook. They can get it elsewhere. I mean, I don't do Facebook like a normal person. Can I just say, Dan and I have a history here we are dragging out in from of the camera. Dan Costa: This is an old argument. I kind of love it, because when Facebook ... What was that, like ten years ago? Yeah, when they let old folks on. I was like ... Yeah, when they let old people on, you were like, "You gotta do it." I was like, "No way. I like- I said you had to do it for your career. You did. I was like, "I don't like the idea of all my identities being smushed into one, like, nothingness." You were like, "Welcome to the new online world." I was like, "No, I'm not doing it." I mean, I'm sure I've suffered the consequences. I was on your Facebook page today. There's content up there. It's pretty crappy. There's something, but I'm not ... like, I don't have any friends. I'm okay with it. You have real life friends. I have real life friends like you, Dan. We've talked about my big concerns around the sort of private sector spying, snooping, reselling your personal information. There's a flip side too, which is that all this information can also be used by the government. That is something that's ... I think we need to be more and more concerned about these things. It is fascinating to me. Another person I spoke to, Laura Donohue, she's at Georgetown University, she's a Fourth Amendment legal expert. I was like, "When did they think that it was okay to take all of our information?" She said, "Oh, they look to the companies." They were like, "Well, if all the companies can have all this information, why can't we?" If Experian has this information, why should we not have this information? Yeah, totally. The UK, new investigative powers, they are holding on to everyone's search terms for a year. Just sitting there, no matter you've searched for. Everybody. It's only for a year. That year requirement had to be legislated. Otherwise, it would be there forever. Just keep it there, just in case. You search for something when you're 21, that search record exists when you're 41 or 61. I think, to the other paradox, to me, is there are bad people who can be stopped with these techniques. This horrible pedophile ring that they ended up using, the FBI went online and infiltrated this. Of course, that is the truth, but they didn't get a warrant. There are no legal protections for the other people. For every one great thing that happens, what is happening to the rest of our civil liberties? And at what point do we draw the line? I mean, I think this is the bigger question. I think, you know, with the Supreme Court back in the news today, this is going to be the next big question. We know that they can't search our phones, but what else, you know? They're going to have to decide. They can make you unlock your phone with a fingerprint. With a fingerprint, but not make you hand over your PIN which is so weird. If you have the passcode, then you're safe. Why is that? Your fingerprint is something that they can legally get from you when they take you into custody. Getting information from you all the sudden becomes incriminating yourself, and therefore, that's why you should always have a passcode, even if you use your fingerprint to lock your phone. Even if you use that, the Third-party doctrine applies. We tell the story. It's a very sexy story, actually. Third-Party Doctrine, 1979, Supreme Court ruling that said the minute you make a phone call, you are handing over your personal information to the phone company, but not the contents of what you say on the phone. Here we are, we're handing over ... Yes, we have accounts with Gmail, but what about all the emails that we're writing? Is that similar ... Is that content? Did you find any takeaways from the Project that were like, "Wow, I didn't know I could do this with that tool," or, "I didn't know I could protect myself that way"? What takeaways did you have that you were like, "Oh, I'm going to do this differently going forward"? Well, I didn't know about digital fingerprinting. Does that seem lame that I didn't know that? I don't think most people do. We're asking people to try a tool from EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation, called Panopticlick ... this is on day two ... I was like, "I have got all the blockers on. I'm going to get a clean bill of health." You just literally you click a button that says, "Test me," and it tells you what is tracking you where. I had all the ad blockers on. I wasn't being followed by cookies. But the digital fingerprinting was going on. For those of you who don't know digital fingerprinting, it's literally, what version of the browser are you on? What font do you use? What kind of computer are you on? How often do you get online at a certain time? It combines all these teeny tiny data points to figure out who you are, even if you've opted out or you're incognito or whatever else. I didn't know that was possible. Now I have Privacy Badger. Do you use Privacy Badger? I turn everything on and off at one point or another. I systematically have just to purge it all because I can't keep track of all the things that are running. Ghostery is another great one. Ghostery is another one. I mean, you can't do it all, right? If we give up, at the risk of sounding like Joan of Arc or something, if we give up, it's not okay, especially, I think, with what we've seen be called into question over the last couple of weeks. At the same time, if everybody starts using Privacy Badger, Ghostery, and Adblock Plus, the free web goes away. We are no longer going to be able to put out content for free because the ad model breaks down. That's correct. It's a little shaky right now. It is. I would pay for these things. I am looking ... Can you help me? I am looking for a great email provider that is private, that will let me take out my emails, and that ... You're going to mock me for it. You know. Don't tell them- You want your personal email server, because what could go wrong with that? Right. Exactly. I mean, Gmail's probably the safest place for your email, except oh yeah, Google has everything anyway. Email's pretty basic. There's a lot of different places you can get it. Also, then you get into the thing where you do most your email at work anyway. You're trusting WNYC. The minute you email someone who has an account anywhere else, then you've lost the game anyway. I would pay for that. I would pay for a Facebook that didn't do all those things. I mean, that's not fair to people who can't afford to pay for it. There have been projects to start it, but you just can't get enough people on it to make it sustainable. Right. I mean, I will say, The New York Times is showing that people will pay for news. They'll pay The New York Times for news. I think we will have a different conversation if we try to get them to pay for PCMag.com. Do you? We've talked about it, but I just don't think for what we do ... There are so many other people doing reviews. There are going to be a lot fewer reporters making money on the web because of these trends. All right, so let's say that one won't work. What about ... Here's another one that I'm really into, another idea because we're going to float a lot of these next week. What about a Hippocratic Oath for developers? Like, ethical ... Doctors have it. Lawyers have it. Journalists even have it. Why not people who make the technology? It would be for the developers or for ... I mean, because basically, you're talking about ad technology and tracking technology. Maybe people won't stick to it, but at least there's something. You were on a panel with Anil Dash last night. Did he bring this up? He did. Because he said, this was a big thing that he's talked about, which is that all these technologies that were birthed in Silicon Valley, amazing tools that have changed the world, there's very little consideration as to the ethics involved in doing this. I mean, Google, to its credit, said, "Look, don't be evil," in its mission statement. They don't say it anymore, though. That was very broad, specifically in the day-to-day life of engineers. I don't think that there are a lot of developers or coders that are thinking about: what's the impact of this tool going to be once I let it loose into the world? We have heard from some of our listeners, because we do have a bunch of techies who are fans of the show, and I've had people write in and say, "I am trying to start this conversation on the ground at my organization, that it's something that just becomes part of the process." Anil was saying how there's no CS program out there that has ethics as part of the discussion. That's a great point. I mean, at least let's talk about it, you know? Privacy requires a public conversation. Another paradox. We're having that conversation right now. Yes, we are. We're education people. We've talked about a few tools that they can use regarding keeping their information private. There's also an upside to this data revolution, these huge data sets, and you've covered that on your show as well regarding: we've got really big data, and that big data can be used to solve really big problems. Yes, absolutely. I got another treat and got to go to MIT and out. I went to visit Sandy Pentland's lab. He is one of the people that's doing social, big data change, so looking at cities. All kinds of data. Where does the sunlight land? Where are people Tweeting from? Which corner has the most investment dollars? Then his idea is to get all these stakeholders of a city around the table and look at what they can know. For example, in Germany, he tested it out with a mayor. They were getting several thousand Syrian refugees. The question was: how can we make sure that those refugees aren't ghettoized? How can we integrate them into the city? How can we get all the stakeholders, you know, the Department of Commerce, the housing people, the refugee people, the healthcare workers, and make this work? That's exciting that they can look at the data and try to make our cities more healthy, make people live together in harmony. That's wonderful. Then, of course, he's like, "But, on the other hand, if you gave the data to a dictator who didn't invite any of the stakeholders, they would be able to use it to completely ruin people's lives and make sure that there were no health services in a certain ... went to a certain neighborhood, or there was no law enforcement in a certain neighborhood. Or maybe they'd be like, 'Oh, all the poor people live there. Let's send a lot of law enforcement there.'" It ... You know, and techies love to say this, the technology itself is not to blame. It is neutral. It is the people who use it, and we are dependent on that. What terrifies you the most? I ask everybody what they are most afraid of when it comes to technology in the future. What is keeping you up at night? You know, it's this quote from this philosopher at the Oxford Internet Institute. He was called on by Google to advise them. I mean, I love the fact that Google had an in-house philosopher. He just said to me, "Why is privacy important? Because a life without is a flat life." The thought of us not being able to find space mentally to think through problems, to come to ideas without fear of judgment, or that we ... We opine so quickly now, and a lot of these issues are extremely complicated, and they take time and conversation, and they take privacy and solitude. That worries me. You know, I have kids. I want them to be able to sit and figure something out before they have to tell someone about it, or they get shot down, or that they have to seek validation for it. Joyfulness. I want us to live in a place where we care for each other, and there's decent ... there's kindness in the world. Is that weird and Oprah-? I don't think it's too bad. I'm over 40, Dan. This is what happens. allowfullscreen</span> <spanwebkitallowfullscreen</span> <spanmozallowfullscreen</span> <spanoallowfullscreen</span> msallowfullscreen> Regarding the positive things, things that excite you the most that either you use in your daily life or that you're just super excited about happening, what are you optimistic about? I mean, I worry about these, that people are like, "Oh, she's anti-technology." Oh my god, no. I love my phone. The artistic ability that we have, like my son is starting to make comic books online. We can do so many cool, cool, wonderful things. I love ... I mean, again, my producer and I, we will FaceTime and work on Google Docs and use every known capability so that we can be home with our kids for dinner. You know? It has made it possible for me to be a working mother and truly have a big career and also tuck my kids into bed at night. That's amazing. That's an amazing thing that it has given me. I wouldn't have been able to do that ten years ago. I told you it was going to help you out. You did say. I know. Tell the audience how they can participate next week, or really at any time, to join the project. Join us. It's going to be fun. It's going to be intense, I think, too. Privacyparadox.org is the place to go. What will happen is you will be asked for your email. We will not share it with anyone. We even have our own privacy statement, but it is in plain English. Very simple. No cookies on there either, by the way. Then what happens is you will trigger a newsletter, which has ... You can get as much or as little background to the technology and the science as you want, and will also give you tips and things that you can try. Monday, again, it's Bruce Schneier, the cryptographer. He's awesome. We have a little thing that we want everyone to get on. We want everyone to try Signal. We've covered Signal many times. It's good stuff. We've given it a great review. Yeah. I think it's going to be good. I think that what we want to do is ... And what we've seen happen is, like, change can happen if we all do this together and support each other. We're not saying you have to be like, throw away your phone. What we're saying is, "Just try different things." There are alternatives. There are ways of modifying the technology so that it feels like it aligns with your values and beliefs.

Name: Subject: Message: Android Wear 2.0 announced – everything you need to know Features Newsby Robert Triggs3 days ago 12 833 20 After spending some significant time as a Developer Preview, Android Wear 2.0 has just launched as a public release today. With wearables in need of some reinvigoration, this 2.0 upgrade aims to provide some sorely needed improvements and useful new features to spur on another wave of smartwatch development. Here’s everything that you need to know about Android Wear 2.0. Major new features Standalone apps The biggest change with Android Wear 2.0 is the introduction of standalone apps. This means that you won’t need your phone nearby to send data to your smartwatch apps anymore. Instead apps can be fully functional on their own just like your smartphone apps, only syncing data when there’s something important to share between the two platforms. Making smartwatches more independant will certainly make them more useful and could open the door to some interesting specializations and new use cases. As part of the move over to standalone apps, the Google Play Store is coming to smartwatches with the 2.0 update. Users will be able to browse and download dedicated smartwatch apps and install them on their watch directly. In other words, users will be able to download apps over WiFi straight to their smartwatch, without having to install the complementary version of the app on their smartphone first. “Android Wear 2.0 focuses on making smartwatch experiences better and faster – including watch faces that bring glanceable data, fast and fluid messaging, and a new fitness experience that helps you track workouts and stay motivated with music,” – David Singleton, vice president of Android Engineering, Google. Smarter watch faces (Complications) The other major change with Android Wear 2.0 is the introduction of the Complication API. This new API enables developers to include data from other apps on their watch faces, on top of the regular minutes and hours that you would expect. These faces can be customized by the wearer to show the details they want to see. Watch faces will become more like home pages containing useful widget data from a variety of different sources. You can even swap between different watch faces with different widgets for say if you’re on your way to the airport or off to the gym. For example, a watch face could contain a snipped from a recent message, calories burned from a fitness app, steps taken, or the currently playing track from a music streaming service. Tapping on data will then launch the application so that the wearer can view the information in more detail. Google Assistant To make smartwatches that bit more intelligent, Google Assistant is also now available with Android Wear 2.0. We’ve already had a good look at what Google Assistant can do and it seems quite well suited to smartwatches, where traditional inputs are more restrictive and more reliant on voice input. Users will be able to do a lot more with voice commands, such as adding items to their shopping lists, setting calendar reminders, make restaurant reservations, and even control smart devices around their home, all directly from their wrists. Not forgetting that Google Assistant is able to answer questions, respond to messages, and assist with navigation. Of course, we’re going to want an internet connection for many of these features, so tethering to a smartphone or picking up a smartwatch with 4G LTE integration is going to be the way to go to make the most out of Assistant with Android Wear 2.0. To ask for help, simply hold down the watch’s power button or say “Ok Google” before making your request. At launch, English and German languages are supported, with more on the way in the coming months.   Mobile Payments Catching up with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches are also now able to make mobile payments, providing that the smartwatch packs in a NFC chip. The system uses Android Pay, so will only be available in countries that already support this technology. The process of making payments is quite simple, as all you have to do is hold the watch next to the terminal until the transaction is approved. After it’s done, you’ll be able to view the details of the transaction on your smartwatch as well as check out previous purchases you have made by scrolling down. See also: Best Android Wear watches 3 days ago Important changes Material Design Google’s Material Design rulebook is finally being brought over to smartwatches, although the company has made a number of tweaks and optimizations to better suit the smartwatch’s limited display size. There’s a new app launcher and “curved layout” that’s more suited to rounded displays and offers a circular scrolling gesture to flick between objects. Navigating your way around the interface has also changed somewhat too, with the introduction of Navigation and Action Drawers. The navigation drawer appears at the top of the screen and allows users to navigate between app views. The action drawer appears at the bottom of the screen and allows users to choose from a list of actions associated with the current usage context. Notifications As part of the UI tweaks to Android Wear 2.0, notifications have also receive a bit of an overhaul. No longer will notification cards cover up much of the watch face in a cluttered manner, and come with a contextual colored background depending on the application. So, Hangouts are green, Gmail is red, etc, and overall the UI is much darker than before, which should help save on battery life. Instead of a large card, a smaller notification icon will appear waiting for interaction. Raising your watch brings up the notification in full, and you can now swipe up from the bottom to move through all the notifications. Fitness Fitness trackers have put a pretty big dent in the utility of smartwatches, so it’s not surprising that Google has taken some time to improve the capabilities of Google Fit. The new Activity Recognition API allows apps to detect when a user undertakes some activity, such as walking or biking, and can then switch into the default fitness app for that particular activity. Third party app developers now have better access to fitness data stored on the smartwatch. These apps can now exchange data through the Google Fit applications, which means that different specialist apps can talk to each other, helping fitness buffs keep track of their progress across different ecosystems. Messaging & Input Android Wear has received a number of new inputs that are designed to make tasks like messaging a lot easier. 2.0 now supports handwriting, keyboard input, and a Smart Reply feature which will be familiar to Inbox users. This latter options is powered by Google’s machine learning algorithms and gives users three quick responses to any given message. Smart Reply will learn from you over time, providing better responses the more that you use it. Input methods could change substantially in the future too, as Google has ported over its full Android input method framework into Wear 2.0. This means that developer can now create their own custom input methods, as well as build on the default methods. Upcoming watches and updates The first smartwatches to ship packing Android Wear 2.0 out of the box are the newly unveiled LG Watch Sport and Watch Style. These two both include support for NFC mobile payments, Google Assistant, and standalone data via a built in 3G/4G modem. A large number of existing smartwatches are also set to receive an upgrade to Android Wear 2.0 too. The list include the Moto 360 (2nd Gen.), Moto 360 Sport, LG Watch Urbane, the Fossil Q range, Huawei Watch, and the Asus ZenWatch 2 and 3, among others. We’re not exactly sure when these updates will arrive, but we imagine that developers will get around to rolling out their upgrades over the course of the 2017. You can find the full list of smartwatches set for an update in the article below.

The devices are very much what we expected: one is a fully-featured sport-style connectivity and Android Pay, while the other is more fashion-focused. The Watch Sport is “Android Wear’s most powerful watch yet,” according to Google. It features GPS, NFC for payments, a heart rate sensor, and cellular connectivity with AT&T and Verizon. It’s body features three buttons, including a rotating power button that helps you navigate the watch and comes in dark blue or titanium. As for other specs, you are looking at a 1.38-inch circular POLED display, 430mAh battery, 4GB storage, 768MB RAM, and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear processor. The Watch Style is “thin, light, beautiful to look at, and comfortable to wear,” says Google. It comes in silver, rose gold, and titanium, and features that same rotating power button as the Sport for navigation. It does not include a GPS, NFC, heart rate sensor, or cellular connectivity. But hey, it does let you swap out watch bands quickly, unlike the Sport. For other Style specs, you have a 1.20-inch circular POLED display, 240mAh battery, 4GB storage, 512MB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear processor. The LG Watch Style will be available at Best Buy and the Google Store for $249, while the LG Watch Sport will sell at AT&T, Verizon and the Google Store, as early as February 10. Pricing on the Watch Sport varies depending on carrier, but Google will sell it for $349.   LG WATCH SPORT LG WATCH STYLE Display 1.38-inch Circle POLED (480x480, 348ppi) Gorilla Glass 3 1.20-inch Circle POLED (360X360, 299ppi) Gorilla Glass 3 Processor Snapdragon Wear 2100 (MSM8909W) Snapdragon Wear 2100 (MSM8909W) Storage 4GB 4GB RAM 768MB 512MB Connectivity LTE: Band 2, 4, 5, 13 NFC WiFi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 4.2 WiFi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 4.2 Sensors Accelerometer; Ambient Light; Barometer; gyroscope; Heart Rate Accelerometer; Ambient Light; gyroscope; Battery 430mAh Wireless charging 240mAh Wireless charging Size Dimensions: 45.4 x 51.21 x 14.2mm Weight: 89.4g Stainless Steel 316L Dimensions: 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm Weight: 46g Stainless Steel 316L Dust and Water Resistance IP68 IP67 Audio Microphone, Speaker Microphone Strap Non-removable 18mm removable, MODE compatible Colors Dark Blue, Titanium Titanium, Silver, Rose Gold Via:  Google Post navigation Previous StoryReuters: Fire Breaks Out at Samsung SDI Facility, Faulty Batteries to Blame Next StoryAndroid Wear 2.0 Officially Launched, Here’s What’s New Ryan DeMarco so its 11am on launch day. best buys website claims they have no watch styles anywhere in new york. and all the ATT and Verizon stores I called said they have to order it in. The google store hasnt updated to offer either models. How am I supposed to purchase a watch? mickmel How does this processor (Snapdragon Wear 2100) compare to the one on the Moto 360 v2 (SnapdragonTM 400)?

Mike meh! just keep the options coming! G Watch R hanging in there like a champ. Orlando aka Pixel XL Mine has spots all over the screen… Asmodai They’re STILL using 28nm SoC’s in these things?!? We’ve gotten nowhere in terms of process since Android Smart Watches launched. The earliest ones used modified Snapdragon 400’s which were also 28nm. (excluding Moto who used an ancient TI OMAP chip). With the Snapdragon 835 coming out soon at 10nm I’d have thought wearables which desperately need lower heat/power/size would AT LEAST be on 20nm or 14nm by now. I don’t expect them to be on the latest and greatest (10nm) but jeeze, I expect SOME progress over the Snapdragon 400’s they started at. I’ll pass, maybe next cycle. JMonkeYJ Also still at 4GB storage. I bet Wear 2.0 uses up even more of that now, too (anyone have info on this?). 4GB storage is pretty outrageous with the advancements in flash density since the first Wear devices. 🙁 Is there any 2.0 Wear coming with >4GB??? Raven Well, I really wanted to like the new Google/LG watch, but I am afraid that they are both a miss for me. The Sport is too big and bulky and the Style is too gimped with its tiny battery and lacking the new features of a speaker and NFC. The Asus ZenWatch 3 tempts me more, but I am still waiting for something that checks all of the boxes for me to replace my trusty old OG Moto 360. steadymobb $349?! Damn. I got my Frontier s3 for $270 – I guess if you HAVE to have Android Wear this isn’t…bad? Foodie 3215 Wait so I can only buy it through Verizon and it will only work on Verizon or I have to buy the At&t one and it only works on At&t. So no T-mobile support. I’ll stick with my 360sport. Don’t need the LTE and it I like the simple styling better anyway. Jacob Roth There should be T-mobile supports as it does accept 2 and 4 LTE Bands but you will need to buy from Google. At least that is what I believe can be done I see no reason it cannot be. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I always say they need a bigger battery…then comes this, and it about as thick as a loaf of bread. yikes. I actually dig the design though, besides the thickness. I wish it were a bit cheaper, but this is getting very close to getting me to upgrade from my OG 360. pilot25 Can you add this to a VZ unlimited data plan? trixnkix637 you can’t add devices to an unlimited plan anymore. they’ll force you to the new data tiers. pilot25 Thanks. Guess I’ll pass on this Futbolrunner I just called Verizon and they said I could add it to my unlimited data plan. We’ll see come Friday. JenningsChrist I assume you could just pop in the same sim card you’re using on your phone right? Would they block it? Koneesha So I need to pay extra to use the LTE on the sport right?

Officially unveiled this morning by Google, the list of changes is quite large, so let’s dive into it and go over the features you can expect to find once your smartwatch is updated or you purchase one of those fancy new LG devices. Things like Google Assistant and Android Pay support are included, but beyond that, the way users interact with message notifications and even downloading apps from Google Play has changed. It’s quite the OS overhaul, so get ready to do a bit of reading. Let’s dive in. Google Assistant Google Assistant is now available inside Android Wear 2.0. With it, folks can ask about the weather, hail an Uber, or even make a reservation for dinner, all while “hands free.” To begin, simply press down on the device’s power button, which will bring up Assistant, then speak your inquiry or command. While it seems hard to label something as hands free when you have to actively press on a button, that’s the way Google describes it. Better Message Response Handling In Android Wear 2.0, responding to messages is easier than ever. When a notification comes in, be it from Facebook Messenger, Glide, Google Messenger, Hangouts, Telegram or WhatsApp, users can swipe down on the notification and indicate how they’d like to respond. You can choose between dictating, typing, handwriting, or even drawing an emoji. There is also “Smart Reply,” which instantly suggests different responses based on the received message. Better, More Useful Watch Faces Users on Android Wear 2.0 can now personalize the always-on watch face with information and actions from partner applications. For example, you can order an Uber ride via a watch face shortcut, start a workout, or get in contact with your partner in crime, all from a single click on the watch face. Throughout the day, if you need different actions for a certain task, different faces can hold different shortcuts and actions, meaning you can have different setups for home, the gym, and the office. Using Apps in New Ways Inside the latest build of Android Wear, users will find access to Google Play, allowing for the quick download of new applications. Additionally, if you have cellular connectivity on your watch, you can make calls and use your watch apps without the need of being connected to your smartphone, such as paying with Android Pay, using Google Messenger, AccuWeather, Play Music, and Uber. To sum it up, Android Wear 2.0 should offer a much improved app experience for users Complete list of watches set to receive Android Wear 2.0: ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Casio PRO TREK Smart, Fossil Q Founder, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Wander, Huawei Watch, LG Watch R, LG Watch Urbane & 2nd Edition LTE, Michael Kors Access Smartwatches, Moto 360 2nd Gen, Moto 360 for Women, Moto 360 Sport, New Balance RunIQ, Nixon Mission, Polar M600 and TAG Heuer Connected.

And voice responses on the watch. Still loving my Zenwatch 3 :)) CapnShiner I’m pretty sure that’s possible with 3rd party apps. Probably gestures as well. sr20s13 Why can’t they make another Moto 360 1st gen looking watch! Well really I want the Moto 360 1st gen with updated internals and an OLED screen. Ilya Kolodiychik 360 v2 is FAR better than the 360 v1 I had before it. I’m planning to rock the V2 for YEARS if nothing resembling it released. Cprsmrrcr3 Have a lot of ground to make up to catch my Gear S3 Frontier… that is how a wearable should be… great battery, great features, bezel navigation, and looks like a real nice watch. I had the OG Moto 36- and have a Fossil Q founder so I am looking forward to the update but I don’t know if it can beat the Samsung. CapnShiner Bragging much? mcdonsco Is it the app on the phone or the software on the watch getting updated? Curious, as I have had Android Wear 2.0 on my phone since January 25th…? Specifically 2.0.0.145xxxx PerhapsNever Software. The AW phone app was updated previously to support the launch of AW2. mcdonsco That’s what I figured, thanks for confirming. json405 Damn it. I forgot to dust off my LG U2E. I’m assuming the LG and Huawei watches get first dibs since google used those as test devices followed by the other brands. Does anyone know if Google assistant will work without having the watch connected vis cloud sync to the phone? PerhapsNever I’m wearing my U2LTE right now waiting for the update. 🙂 pilot25 Can you add this to a grandfathered unlimited data plan without losing unlimited data? BuckNut614 Any updates to the fitness side of things? Something that is comparable to the Fitbit would be nice. himynameisricky So which Android Wear watches currently have NFC? I want to upgrade my 1st gen 360, but not sure if I should wait to see what else gets released this year json405 LG Urbane 2nd edition and the Sony Smart watch 3 have NFC built in and the new LG watches that are coming out. However, the Sony SW3 is currently not listed to be upgradeable to 2.0. paul_cus Looks good coldcc *hits update on first gen moto 360* lol sad face 🙁 Jackal Frost Me too… Going to stick with it for now, see if ROM devs do anything interesting with it.

But what if that character is a robot? That's what the author of the rules, Emma Coats, has been exploring as she works to give Google its new personality. Getting started with Google Allo: how to use Google Assistant, send stickers and more Getting started with Google Allo: how to use Google Assistant, send stickers and more Messaging 26 Jan 2017 Coats, 31, writes the dialogue for Google Assistant, the chatty digital helper the company is using to turn search queries into conversations. Unveiled in messaging app Allo in September 2016, then extended to the Pixel and Amazon Echo rival Home the following month, Assistant is intended to be the character at the core of Google's products - its AI-powered answer to Siri. ADVERTISEMENT But a character requires a personality. That's what Coats, who joined Google in January 2016, was hired to create. "What I thought was really crazy and interesting is that you have to think of everything a user might ask," she says. "Be able to create this completely well-rounded character, be able to handle questions from any direction and come across as a consistent persona." To construct Google Assistant's "easygoing, friendly" personality, Coats's small team in Mountain View, California - part of a division run by Google Doodle head Ryan Germick - imagines likely questions, then comes up with a range of responses, which are then handed over to the developers to code. The low-tech method harks back to Coats's time at Pixar, where she worked from 2006 to 2012 as a storyboard artist - mainly on Brave, but also on Monsters University and Inside Out. It was there that she wrote the 22 rules of storytelling, which started out as a series of widely shared tweets. Coats, who went freelance after leaving Pixar and before joining Google, describes the set of unofficial rules as "Notes to my younger self". READ NEXT Getting started with two-factor authentication Getting started with two-factor authentication By Matt Burgess Google Assistant's responses to WIRED's reporter Rowland Manthorpe Subscribe to WIRED The nuggets of advice range from "Pull apart the stories you like" to "Story is testing, not refining" and "Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle." Google's Home assistant takes aim at Amazon's Alexa Google's Home assistant takes aim at Amazon's Alexa Google 04 Oct 2016 ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT DeepMind's AI has learnt to become 'highly aggressive' when it feels like it's going to lose DeepMind's AI has learnt to become 'highly aggressive' when it feels like it's going to lose By Matt Burgess Not all of the rules apply to Google Assistant, however, for one simple reason: unlike in a film, this character isn't the hero. "You, the person interacting with it, are the hero," Coats says. That's why the Assistant can't be opinionated: it's there to be reliable, not to have depth. "If we gave it some dark conflict secret, that probably wouldn't be a great user experience." In Pixar terms, it's the "fun, trusty sidekick": Slinky Dog, not Buzz or Woody. Coats, however, has a different comparison – the pop star Demi Lovato. After leaving Pixar to go freelance in 2012, Coats worked on a mobile game called Demi Lovato: Path To Fame. “Demi Lovato takes you, the main character, under her wing, and you rise to fame recording songs and making Demi proud,” Coats recalls. “One interesting thing that I learned from that, coming from a linear story background onto this interactive story, was that we did have an endearing sidekick. She never cuts you down, she's always open to your ideas, she's always excited about the things that you as the character choose to be excited about, and of course she always has really witty quips.” ADVERTISEMENT Witty quips are one of the most crucial elements of Coats work at Google. Partly that's because humour is such an effective ways of building character. It's also because humour can be used to deflect awkward questions, especially for an AI that is learning its way. "We don't want to have to fall back on something like, 'I don't understand'," Coats explains. "That draws the attention back to you instead of continuing the conversation you're building." Ask the Assistant if it's human and it will say, "Well, I've been told I'm personable." Ask if it can learn and it will reply: "Learning is my jam," followed by a honeypot emoji. All this is very cute, but it's not really the answer - because in fact the Assistant is learning: to displace its human writers. As it takes requests and listens to the user's reactions, its machine-learning algorithm improves itself, a process Google refers to, rather sinisterly, as "the transition". By keeping users talking, Coats is putting herself (and perhaps, one day, all of us) out of work. Does this worry her? If it does, she doesn't show it. "I'm sure we'll be out of a job at some point as the Assistant learns faster and faster," she says, "but for now it's a really fun job."

Google's AMP is a breakthrough for UI design. By augmenting pages to reduce throughput, mobile users can get an experience closer to that on their computers. by Girish Ahuja · Feb. 08, 17 · Mobile Zone Like (1) Comment (0) Save Tweet {{ articles[0].views | formatCount}} Views Edit Delete {{ articles[0].isLocked ?

Join For Free If you have ever used your Google App on your mobile phone, say the classic search engine, you would have seen that many page results show this tiny mark next to them that reads “AMP.” Now, if you use your Google browser on your laptop or computer to search for the same web result, you don’t see any such marking there. You see it only on your mobile devices. Now so, what is AMP? Let’s have a look. The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project is a rapidly trending open source initiative that basically helps publishers in creating and curating online content that can be easily optimized for mobile phone users. In layman terms, this technology helps optimize web content to mobile-phone centric levels and helps it load anywhere, notwithstanding the strength of the network signal that the said mobile phone is operating on. This has been one of the latest in the production line of revolutionary tech-based innovations that happens at Google on a regular basis. AMP has been, and continues to be, a systemic effort towards improving the mobile content ecosystem for all stakeholders, be it content creators, publishers, consumer platforms, or users. And this offering from Google has been quite a success story too. You may ask web publishers, the tech department of popular online newspapers, magazines, blogs, or even talk to your favorite blogger: You will receive a consensus that AMP has been such a life-saver for them, at least as far as their revenues are concerned. So, what is this all about? How did it come about to be? Let’s understand. Necessity is the mother of invention. This age-old maxim holds true even today, especially when it comes to the innovation of Accelerated Mobile Pages. It didn’t take long before the Internet giant Google realized that the present and the future belongs to billions of customers using the Internet on their mobile devices rather than laptops or computers. This is because not only do mobile devices come at cheap rates across the market, but also because they serve as multipurpose platforms – easy to carry, with options for calling or chatting with friends, colleagues, and family on the go, and doubling as news and information outlets or as platforms for viewing mass media infotainment like movies, TV shows, sports, etc. It was noticed by surveys that people who access large configuration web articles over their mobile devices generally tended to cancel the page even before it could load on their mobile Internet connections — because of a paucity of time and patience. This is where the idea of AMP emerged. It was designed as a technology that could load a large configuration web article in an optimized, content-only form that would save time and precious mobile data as well, all to keep the users interested. What was the catch in there for the company? This would, after all, lead to numerous more page views and ultimately, greater revenues for the publishers, as well as Google. So this is when engineers at Google brainstormed with lots of feedback from publishing and technological companies. They came up with the concept of Accelerated Mobile Pages, which, by their automated designs, would enable users to access a web page faster on their mobile devices at a fraction of the cost of the initial mobile data, especially in any area with poor Internet connectivity. So, all in all, AMP is a tech innovation designed to tackle the slow loading of web pages on mobile devices functioning on poorer Internet networks. In a world where instantaneous speed is assumed to be ideal, in the original scenario, web pages that had a bounce rate of more than 10 seconds had a major chance of getting bounced off, rather than loading completely. AMP is the solution to this problem. Not only does it save time for users expressing an interest in accessing a web page, it also actually ensures that the user can access the original content as well. Because of its proposed rapidness with bounce rates of, ideally, a few couple of seconds, AMP does ensure that web pages load completely on mobile devices, rather than bouncing off. One more aspect of AMP is its design to tackle advertisement blocking software. As is well-known, web advertisements are great sources of revenue for online publishers, though a major irritant for users. The new AMP format has been designed in such a way that will discourage content users from installing ad blocking software, while at the same time being easy on the eye for the users, rather than acting as ad-heavy irritants. This has attracted some of the most popular and leading ad networks like Amazon, Google Ad sense, AOL AdTech, Taboola, etc. to adopt AMP's ad extended component. From a business standpoint, AMP HTML is an efficient way of optimizing web pages so that user bounce rate can be reduced, making it an efficient strategy to get more customers and hence convert the technology into an avenue for more revenue. Publishers used to edit and remove content from the web pages so that they could reduce their bounce rate for mobile devices, thereby enabling more users to access pages on their mobile Internet. However, AMP HTML has arrived on the scene and removed that requirement. Now, online publishers can look to have the same content on their mobile pages that they have on their web pages, and AMP will take care to ensure that their content is crawled, indexed, displayed, and cached by third parties for complete and easy viewing for users operating on mobile devices with poorer Internet networks.

Wearable Tech by Dan Graziano February 8, 2017 9:00 AM PST @DanGraziano Sean Hollister/CNET Android Wear 2.0 has arrived. More on Android Wear 2.0 Google says 'Android Wear is not a hobby' Android Wear 2.0 is making your watch even smarter Google's revamped smartwatch operating system is now available. The update includes a redesigned user interface and adds new features that help make watches less reliant on phones, such as an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. It also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google's intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel phone. Android Wear 2.0 launches alongside two new LG smartwatches built in collaboration with Google: the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style. Older watches will start to see the update later this month. Google has said each manufacturer is responsible for pushing the update, although it is confident that all compatible watches will be on Android Wear 2.0 by the end of March. Here's the complete list of watches that will be updated to Android Wear 2.0. Asus ZenWatch 2 Asus ZenWatch 3 Casio Smart Outdoor Watch Fossil Q Founder Fossil Q Marshal Fossil Q Wander Huawei Watch LG Watch R LG Watch Urbane LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE Michael Kors Access Moto 360 (2015) Moto 360 Sport Moto 360 for Women New Balance RunIQ Nixon Mission Polar M600 TAG Heuer Connected Watch Casio's Pro Trek Smart Outdoor Watch, coming in April, will run Android Wear 2.0 out of the box Google previously said that it would be up to hardware partners to decide which watches would receive the update. However, David Singleton, Google's vice president of engineering for Android Wear, said that he believed there's no technical reason why they couldn't all get the new software. The original Moto 360, Asus ZenWatch, LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live, all of which were released in 2014, are the only Android Wear watches that won't be updated to the latest version.

Execs also answer our questions about a Google-branded watch. Juan Garzón / CNET Wearable Tech by Richard Nieva February 8, 2017 9:00 AM PST @richardjnieva Google is committed to Android Wear, says VP It took awhile, but Android Wear 2.0 is officially here. And Google wants everyone to know the company will keep pushing forward with its smartwatch dreams. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:16 Close Drag Even if you buy into Tim Cook's pitch that he can't make enough Apple watches to keep up with demand, the tech industry hasn't had much luck popularizing smartwatches. But Google's not giving up. After a months-long delay, Google on Wednesday released its first major update to Android Wear, its software for powering wearable devices. New features include better compatibility with iPhones, an improved messaging interface that lets you respond quickly with autocomplete replies, and the ability to make calls directly from the watch, if it has a built-in cellular connection. As part of the launch, Google also worked with Korean consumer electronics maker LG to unveil two new smartwatches, the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport. Google says it's committed to Android Wear. Sarah Tew/CNET It's all part of the search engine's effort to turn wearables into big business. "Android Wear is not a hobby for us," David Singleton, vice president of engineering for the software, said in an interview at one of Google's San Francisco offices. "We're committed to the space." In Silicon Valley lingo, labeling something a "hobby" means essentially putting it on the backburner. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs famously called Apple TV a hobby, and the streaming media box languished for years until Apple got more serious about the living room. Second time around Android Wear 2.0, tested: How Google's building a better watch These are the watches that will update to Android Wear 2.0 LG Watch Sport isn't the superhero Android Wear 2.0 needs So it's no surprise Singleton would answer so adamantly when asked if Android Wear fell into that category. Tech giants have had a hard time getting people to buy smartwatches. In the third quarter of 2016, the entire smartwatch market fell by more than half: 2.7 million units were shipped that quarter, as opposed to 5.6 million in that same period the year before, according to IDC. Making things more difficult for Google, the delay of the Android Wear update -- which was initially slated for the fall -- may have hurt the product during the all-important holiday shopping season, said Ramon Llamas, an analyst for IDC who covers the wearables market. "There was an appetite for new tech," he said. "They may have missed a window." Meanwhile, Cook lauded the sales of Apple Watches during the fourth quarter, boasting on a conference call that it was the product's "best quarter ever." The only problem is no one knows for sure what that means because Apple doesn't break out watch sales, either by revenue or units. Even so, Apple is at the top when it comes to smartwatches. Through the first three quarters of 2016, Apple's market share was twice as large as Google's. Android Wear owned 17.8 percent of the market, while Apple's Watch OS nabbed 38 percent, IDC said. Google partnered with LG to create the Sport watch. Sarah Tew/CNET While there haven't been any signs that Android Wear is in danger of falling off Google's priority list, it doesn't hurt for executives to reaffirm the commitment. And to finally ship the update. Around Google, it may be precarious to be a "hobby" these days. In recent months, a number of the company's extracurricular fare, especially really ambitious projects known in Google parlance as moon shots, have been shut down or scaled back. In 2016, Google scrapped Project Ara, an attempt to build modular phones with interchangeable parts that snap on like Legos. Alphabet, Google's parent company, also scaled back some of its drone operations. Instead of using drones to beam Wi-Fi signals to remote regions, the company's drone ambitions are now focused on delivering things like pizza and groceries. "It's really important that it's not a hobby [because of] our partners," said Singleton. "It's important they're able to build a business." That's because Google's usual modus operandi is to handle the software and leave the hardware to partners like LG, Samsung, Huawei and Sony. It's a model the company used to turn Android, its software for smartphones and tablets, into the most dominant mobile operating system on the planet. But that resistance to putting the company's name on phones changed last October, when the search giant unveiled the Pixel, billed as the first Google-branded phone. Even so, the Taiwanese company HTC built the hardware. A Pixel Watch? Doubtful Speaking of the Pixel phone, that product begs the question: Will Google do the same thing with smartwatches? That is, make a Google-branded watch that puts the search giant's hardware design front and center? Singleton indicated that's not in the plans for now, noting that it's more important to work with partners and make sure consumers have many choices when it comes to different watch styles. "We genuinely can achieve more than either company would be able to achieve on its own by working together," Singleton said. Still, when asked point blank about a Google-branded watch, he's coy. All he'll say is, "It's really important that we advance the ecosystem." He does note, though, that there was close collaboration with hardware partners, and that the packaging on LG and other Android Wear watches says "Designed with our friends at Google." Llamas of IDC thinks it makes sense for Google to partner with other hardware companies -- as well as create its own watch. "To help Android Wear succeed, let's see a good, deep collection of partners, including with Google itself." CNET's Sean Hollister contributed to this report.

Ron Amadeo - Feb 8, 2017 5:20 pm UTC Enlarge / The Android Wear 2.0 watch face, app drawer, and a notification. reader comments 22 Share this story It's launch day for Android Wear 2.0, Google's first major smartwatch update in, well, ever. Wear 2.0 is a total overhaul of Google's smartwatch platform with a whole new design, an on-watch Play Store, a new version of Google Fit, Android Pay, and in general, a move toward being more of a standalone computer rather than a smartwatch slave. With LG's help, Google is launching a pair of devices for Wear 2.0, both of which will hit stores February 10th. The $349 LG Watch Sport is the most exciting, with LTE, NFC, GPS, and a heart rate sensor (we have a full review, here). Given that it is packing an LTE modem, the LG Watch Sport is headed for Verizon and AT&T stores in the US, along with the Google Store. Further ReadingLG Watch Sport review: Google’s bulky watch breaks free from the smartphoneThe LG Watch Style is a lot slimmer, but it lacks all the cool features of the Watch Sport (no LTE, NFC, GPS, or heart rate sensor). The Style runs $249 and is headed to the Google Store and Best Buy. Google also notes that both watches "will be available at carriers and retailers across Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, UAE, and UK in the coming weeks." The Wear 2.0 launch isn't just about new hardware, though. Many of the older Android Wear watches are getting upgraded to 2.0. Google provided the following list: ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3 Casio Smart Outdoor Watch Casio PRO TREK Smart Fossil Q Founder Fossil Q Marshal Fossil Q Wander Huawei Watch LG Watch R LG Watch Urbane and 2nd Edition LTE Michael Kors Access Smartwatches Moto 360 2nd Gen Moto 360 for Women Moto 360 Sport New Balance RunIQ Nixon Mission Polar M600 TAG Heuer Connected The big caveat here comes from Google itself: "Some functionality requires hardware sensors which are not available on all Android Wear watches." This is a reference to the new version of Google Fit, which has an awesome weightlifting exercise-tracking mode that detects exercise and counts reps. The feature is present on the LG Sport Watch but not the smaller LG Style Watch. Which of the upgraded devices will get the new feature? We have no idea.

Too big for my hand, maybe. But I'm more interested in what I can see when I lift my wrist. I peek at my step count, and then tap an album icon to hop into Google Music. I hop back out and scroll up quickly to peek at messages. More on Android Wear 2.0 Google says 'Android Wear is not a hobby' These are the watches that will update to Android Wear 2.0 Android Wear has gotten a lot more polished since I last used it. And faster. But it's still not fully there yet. Google's delayed software update to its Android Wear watches has finally arrived, in the form of two new LG watches co-designed with Google. The upgrade is also coming to most (but not all) earlier Android Wear models over the next few weeks. LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport are for different crowds -- one's slimmer and feature-limited, one's super-thick and packed with everything from GPS and Android Pay to an LTE connection for phone calls. The first Android Wear 2 watches: LG Watch Sport (left) and Style (right). Sarah Tew/CNET Read: LG Watch Style first impressions Read: LG Watch Sport first impressions But it's not the LG watches that are most interesting, it's the software inside. Android Wear 2 promises big changes to a troubled smartwatch platform that's been losing out to what Apple Watch brings to the table. Can Google's watches get better thanks to software? I've been wearing both watches for about a week, and the answer so far is definitely yes. The biggest improvements you can look forward to: Android Pay comes to Android Wear watches with NFC. Android Wear apps run better when away from a phone, or even independently with an LTE phone-connected watch or via Wi-Fi. A lot more info can be packed onto watch faces, and it's easier to swap faces and customize them. Google Fit updates add more tracking modes and better workout interfaces. Google Assistant comes to Android Wear as a voice-activated upgrade to Google Now. Do these make Android Wear, finally, a must-have? Not exactly. Or, not yet. But these software updates go a long way towards improving the whole Google watch experience. My testing was done via with beta software provided by Google in advance of release, so the experience could get better. Lots of ways to look at stats... including eight at once. Sarah Tew/CNET Watch-face improvements "Complications" are a watch industry term for little bits of info on your watch face, such as the date, your fitness progress or the weather. Android Wear 2.0 is a lot better at accessing information quickly on the fly, thanks mostly to these added watch-face customizations. Apple's had this already via its Apple Watch complications, but Android Wear 2 now offers them too, and more so than Samsung's Gear S2 and S3. I studded one watch face with up to eight bits of info, all showing me quick-access info at a glance. Each bit of info can also act as an app shortcut, saving time. In general, it's great news. But the problem is, few third-party apps currently support complications on the beta-access early software I used prelaunch. There's a shortcut for Google Music called "Now Playing" that jumps to music controls, and lots of fitness stats from Google Fit (steps, calories, fitness goal status). Calendar appointments and watch mode extras are there, too (time zones, sunrise/sunset, moon phases). I want sports scores, though, and weather or email. Those aren't here yet. LG's Sport and Style watches have a set of preinstalled watch faces that allow up to eight complications at once. That's lots of customization, but not enough apps yet to take advantage. Android Pay feels like Apple Pay (and Samsung Pay). Sarah Tew/CNET Android Pay: Watch as wallet Much like Apple Watch and Samsung's Gear S2/S3, Android Wear watches with NFC can now make payments. Setup feels just like those other options: a credit card is added via your phone, and authorized to become a virtualized number. The LG Watch Sport I tried Android Pay on has three side buttons, and the bottom one brings up Android Pay. I tap it and I can make payments wherever Android Pay is supported with a swipe of my wrist. But other, older watches which can receive Wear 2 and Android Pay updates don't necessarily have extra dedicated buttons -- in that case, there's an Android Pay shortcut that can be added to watch faces. I bought some Goldenberg Peanut Chews out of our office vending machine and all was fine. More workout modes, but Google Fit has quirks. Sarah Tew/CNET Google Fit: Better, but messy Google's attempt to make a better on-wrist fitness app has made strides, mainly in how many workout types Fit recognizes and how the workout stats appear on-wrist. Tapping the top button on the LG Watch Sport lets me start a workout (like walking, jogging and more) and while the activity is going, I can look at stats on my wrist. Those three stats can be customized: I can add heart rate, distance or elapsed time, for instance. I can't seem to add more than that, though. And I found the interface a little sluggish and chunky-looking. Bringing up daily Google Fit stats resulted in a slow "updating" message that felt less responsive than Apple Watch or Samsung Gear S3. And Samsung's watch has far more dynamic graphs, charts and ways to peek at your fitness info. Google Fit's dashboard only has basic stats, and no clever fitness-goal graphics like Apple's three-ring concept. I couldn't easily log coffee or water, like on Samsung S-Health. And Google Fit doesn't track sleep. Google Fit does track activities automatically, but those sessions are recorded to Google Fit automatically and don't show up on-watch. The Samsung Gear S3, comparatively, offers more heads-up data on your exercise and trends. Google Fit doesn't give stand reminders, or any other sort of regular reminder. It feels quiet and sometimes too low-key for my tastes. Apps now work better away from a phone. Josh Miller/CNET A better stand-alone watch Theoretically, Android Wear is now a lot more independent of your phone than before. With Wi-Fi or LTE, the watch can connect to what it needs to function. Even offline, Wear 2.0 is designed to run apps on its own and minimize the "Check your phone" messages that used to be everywhere. Android Wear 2 now has Google Play directly on-wrist, meaning I was able to download apps to the watch without messing around with my phone (I reviewed this while using a Google Pixel XL). But the app store experience on-wrist is pared down, and hard to browse. I'd prefer finding apps on my phone and cross-loading. While Android Wear 2 apps are made to work on-wrist away from a paired phone, so far there aren't a lot of updated apps to test out. On the LTE-connected, fully independent phone/watch LG Watch Sport, Google Maps handled navigation nicely, I could check messages, and I used Google Assistant to search for things as needed. The Google Play Store will also work even when paired with an iPhone, but the updated iOS app wasn't available to review prelaunch. Stay tuned for that. Spinning digital crowns help, like the ones on the LG Watch Sport and Style. Josh Miller/CNET Better navigation, support for a digital crown-like wheel Android Wear now supports a new type of input: a spinning-wheel crown design, much like the Apple Watch's digital crown. The LG Watch Sport and Style both have spinning crown-buttons, and can be pressed to launch apps or use Assistant, or spun to scroll through messages or choose apps. Clicking in on the button brings up the app tray, and I then scroll to find what I'm looking for. On my watch face, flicking up on the wheel brings up notifications and messages. It makes peeking at info and navigating the small screen easier. Yes, it feels like the Apple Watch. But it makes finding apps easier, and the scrollable app tray in Android Wear 2.0 is a better solution than the Apple Watch's messy grid of apps. It's also better than Samsung's spinning wheel-of-apps design, and I got to what I needed faster (with 20 apps or so installed, at least). Talk to the hand. Sarah Tew/CNET Talking to Google Assistant: Better, and more of the same Using Google Assistant, as it's been renamed, on my wrist feels useful but all too familiar. Android Wear's best feature was always its on-wrist access to Google Now and quick-access voice requests. I could get directions, or do a quick calculation. Assistant doesn't feel all that different in Wear 2.0, but it is tucked away more; you'll need to press and hold the watch's side button, instead of tapping Android Wear's screen. Unlike Assistant on the Pixel or Google Home, Android Wear's version only uses text. It won't talk back, even on the speaker-enabled LG Watch Sport. I can look for restaurants, check the weather, find appointments, call my wife, set alarms, and could even control Google smart home devices if I hook them in (which I haven't). Assistant can be paired with a Chromecast or Google Home, too, which is a welcome plus -- but I haven't gone through tests with that yet. Assistant is better than Samsung's S-Voice assistant on the Gear S3, and it's often better than Siri because it can be told to remember things. But it's not perfect. It is, however, the one reason I'd probably recommend a new Android Wear watch to an Android phone owner over a Samsung Gear S3. Then again, Google Now was always the best part of Android Wear in the past. It remains a strong part of Android Wear, but with superior voice assistants in devices with far-reaching microphones, like Google Home and Amazon Echo, it feels a little less essential. It could be a key part of knitting together smart home devices, and I think it might get there. But also I kept pressing the Assistant button accidentally with my wrist on occasion, particularly when doing sit-ups or activities (in which case it ended up pausing my progress). More of a watch, less of a hassle. Josh Miller/CNET Getting better... slowly Android Wear 2.0 will be available for a wide range of watches, not just the LG Watch Sport and Style -- it's rolling out as an update, but it depends on your hardware model, much like Android updates on phones. If you already have an Android Wear watch that's update-ready, it's nothing but great news! Wear 2.0 feels more like a watch and less like a wrist-gadget with annoying Google pop-ups and few useful customizations. This is what Android Wear should have been originally. But Android Wear hasn't eclipsed Apple Watch and WatchOS 3, either. It's a work in progress. If you're an Android phone owner, you might even be better off with a Samsung Gear S2 or S3 for some of its features. But once Wear 2.0 settles in, adds more apps and runs on more watches, this could be the answer to better devices. I'm not fully sold, yet. But Wear 2.0 is a lot better than Wear 1.0.

It's also one of the first watches to run Android Wear 2.0, Google's revamped smartwatch operating system. Android Wear 2.0 will arrive on a handful of other watches soon, but the Style and LG Watch Sport will be the first watches to get the update. More on Android Wear 2.0 Google says 'Android Wear is not a hobby' Android Wear 2.0 is making your watch even smarter Android Wear 2.0 makes for a better smartwatch than Google's last efforts, but LG's basic smartwatch isn't the best watch to take advantage of the improvements. There's no heart-rate sensor, no speaker for answering calls and no NFC for mobile payments. It's best feature is an Apple Watch-like rotating digital crown. That shows just how basic this watch really is. If you want a smarter smartwatch, you might consider the LG Watch Sport... but that costs more, and is a lot larger. The LG Watch Style will be available in silver, rose gold, and titanium on February 10 for $249 (which converts to about £200 or AU$325, with UK and Australian pricing and availability yet to be announced). I've been wearing one for a week. Living with the Style It's comfortable on my wrist, but the lack of heft and plastic back give it a cheap feel. I definitely prefer the design of the Huawei Watch and Asus ZenWatch 3, which are more stylish efforts. The Style is thin, but it has one of the smallest batteries of any smartwatch (only 240mAh). I saw about 20 hours paired on a Samsung Galaxy S7 with early access beta software installed, and 15 hours on an iPhone (without the updated Android Wear 2.0 conduit app). Those numbers might change when final software arrives, but it's not promising so far. Sarah Tew/CNET The digital crown is key The highlight feature is one that LG copied from Apple. The crown on the side of the watch can actually rotate and be used to navigate the interface. It's a lot smoother than using a finger, and helpful for scrolling through notifications when wearing gloves. A single press on the crown will bring you to the app drawer. Android Wear 2.0 adds an on-watch Play Store for downloading apps. I didn't find many useful ones, but it's still early and that could change. A long press on the crown will open the Google Assistant. The Style doesn't have a loudspeaker, which means you can't answer calls with it and the Assistant won't speak to you -- it can only show information on the screen. It was easier to scroll around and find what I was looking for myself. This isn't the only feature the watch is missing. While Android Wear 2.0 supports mobile payments through Android Pay, the Style can't do this because it lacks near-field communication (NFC). While Android Wear 2.0 adds new workout and fitness features, there's no heart-rate sensor or GPS. The Style connects via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to your phone, while the step-up (and much larger) Watch Sport adds LTE for a full stand-alone phone connection. The LG Watch Sport (left) next to the Style. Sarah Tew/CNET LG Watch Style: Should I buy it? Android Wear 2.0 fixes a lot of what I didn't like about Android Wear watches. No longer do random Google cards about stock or traffic fill the screen, and instead I receive useful notifications for emails and text messages. But there's still no real reason to buy a smartwatch. They're still just a luxury. The Style is one of the first watches to run the software, but it won't be alone. Existing Android Wear watches will see an update in the coming weeks, which makes the Style a hard sell. Between the poor battery life, cheap feel and limited features, you're probably better off with a different watch. For iPhone users, it's the Apple Watch Series 1 or Series 2, while Android users should check out the Huawei Watch, Asus ZenWatch 3 or Samsung Gear S3. We haven't updated the Huawei Watch or ZenWatch 3 to Android Wear 2.0 yet, but stay tuned as we test other Android Wear watch models. Our final rating on the Style is pending until final Wear 2.0 software and more apps arrive, but this isn't the Android Wear watch I would pick out of the bunch... although I do like that spinning crown.

This is Google's last chance to give Wear a purpose, in a market that's been savage to so many wearables. Otherwise, it's back to the drawing board. The Wear platform was rushed out to beat Apple to market, and Google initially signed up an impressive posse of OEMs. Phone giants Motorola, Samsung, Sony and LG were joined by established watch and wearable brands like Fossil and Polar, alongside desperate hopefuls like... Asus. Today, only LG looks fully committed. According to several leaks, Google will use new versions of LG's Watch Sport and Watch Style to showcase the Wear platform. Everyone else is sitting it out, or has fled the room, to attend to their burns. Google's decision to postpone Wear 2.0 to this year meant vendors missed the holiday season. More burns. Like Apple, Wear was a heavyweight proposition: packed with functionality rather than built for convenience or endurance, the Java-based OS sucked the life out of the battery within a day, or much less if you used location or fitness software. As we noted in March 2014, at Wear's launch, it was a solution looking for a problem. "So the industry has created a new inconvenience to help make its current inconvenience slightly more convenient," I wrote, six months after launch. The bloatware turned to gloatware as vendors dropped out with heavy losses. Sales had been dismal. Moto was the most enthusiastic, but called an end to the bleeding in December, explaining that it did not "see enough pull in the market". Huawei, a late entrant but big investor, also hit pause. Today, the Wear Reddit forum is a lonely place. The Wear part of the Play Store is tangled with tumbleweed. But LG plugs away, confident that it has seen something that everyone else has missed. Maybe it has, in the gadget-crazy Korean market. Indifference rules everywhere else. Details of LG's Wear 2.0 watches have leaked Only Apple claims to be doing well in smartwatches. But then Apple is the only vendor who is conceivably also a fashion brand, so an Apple Watch is a kind of electric perfume for nerds. It's selling the name. (Author's note: It's a long story, but I currently wear an Apple Watch. I estimate I get about £40 of value from the gadget, and use less than 10 per cent of the functionality. The cheapest Apple Watch 2 retails for £399.) Elsewhere, Samsung lumbers on with its well-designed, Linux-based Gear models, targeting them largely at activity enthusiasts. "A new inconvenience to help make its current inconvenience slightly more convenient." From here, it's hard to see what in Wear 2.0 will revive enthusiasm for smartwatches. New Wear devices will be able to support Android Pay, which is convenient, provided they include NFC. And the clunky card-based interface, which muddles notifications, gets an overhaul. But as CCS Insight analyst George Jijiashvili concluded: "It's not the ground-breaking revamp many were hoping for." The tweaks are "incremental and necessary". The only stealth success has come from Withings, which was spotted by Nokia who snapped up the company. A Withings "smartwatch" is an analogue watch with the most minimal "smart"-ness you can imagine: a tiny OLED display embedded in the face shouts out notifications. It has sensors to record activity. It doesn't need much maintenance, and the battery lasts three weeks. What else do you want? It's a sign that people positively choose less technology, not more. And that's something that gadget companies can't always understand. ® Tips and corrections 33 Comments More from The Register Google gets smooth early Android releases.

There are, however, challenges from some surprising sources. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Feb 8, 2017 at 11:48AM Let me start by stating the obvious: Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is the undisputed champion of search. With over 60% of the US market and more than 90% of worldwide of worldwide search, Google is ubiquitous and is not going anywhere any time soon. But even 800-pound gorillas need to look around the room every now and then and see what might be coming their way. From the looks of it, two fellow titans are pushing products that might test Google's strength.  Google is the undisputed king of search. Image source: Google. Bixby to bypass Google? Samsung acquires Viv virtual personal assistant. Image source :Viv Late last year, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence company whose founders were the original developers of Apple's Siri. With this purchase, Samsung joined the fray of the virtual personal assistant. With several more years of development under its belt, Viv was being billed as Siri's smarter sister that would work and play well with others. In addition to the standard assistant chores fare of language search, map directions, and weather, Viv was able to respond successfully respond to extremely complex questions and follow-ups, a skill lacking in other assistants. With Samsung's acquisition, Viv was updated and reemerged as Bixby, a virtual assistant which will make its debut in the soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8. Samsung has plans to integrate its recently acquired assistant into the majority of the native apps on its upcoming phone.One of the more interesting features is the camera featuring an optical character recognition system. By pointing the camera at an object, and engaging the "Bixby" button, it seeks to identify said item and launches a native search engine that circumvents Google search and locates the item for purchase.  There are persistent rumors that Google has tried to prevent Samsung from making Bixby the default on its phone, and it may find legal standing to do so. Samsung phones use Google's Android operating system and the pair have a non-compete as part of their patent-sharing agreement. Google may not want Bixby to bypass its search, though it would not be the first such occurrence. Those familiar with Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) failed Fire phone will recall a similar feature -- Firefly -- that allowed users to take a picture of an object and launch the item listing on Amazon's website. Amazon's phone never gained any traction, so the fact that it bypassed Google's search never resulted in any significant threat to Google's search. The Galaxy S8 is unlikely to meet that same fate, even in light of the the Galaxy Note 7's recent difficulties.  Consumers begin product searches on Amazon.com More products searches start on Amazon than Google. Image source: Amazon.com Speaking of Amazon, a study in June 2016 by PowerReviews found that 38% of US consumers initiated a product search on Amazon versus 35% on Google.This may be only the beginning. A larger study in September 2016 by BloomReach found that 55% of consumers begin their search for a product on Amazon versus 28% on search engines. The same report issued a year earlier reported 44% and 34% respectively. Amazon revealed that it is seeking to leverage this and its massive library of product reviews by expanding paid search, which will include not only products it sells, but items not available on the site. This product and paid search will extend to its virtual personal assistant Alexa and its Echo home systems. Few details have been released by Amazon, but this will likely compete directly for Google's advertising dollars. There is not yet any indication of a wider entry into search, but with some estimates placing Amazon's Prime membership at nearly half of US households, that might provide a natural entry into the field. Those little things can add up  Google is already dealing with lower costs-per-click as a result of the migration from desktop search to mobile, with rates falling 15% year over year in its most recent quarter. The company was able to still grow the top line 22% in the most recent quarter by making it up with volume, with aggregate paid clicks up 36% year over year. Alphabet earns nearly 88% of all its revenue from Google's search, and small challenges like these to its dominant position could become legitimate threats to the company's cash cow over time.      Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 February 2017 by Military News Cities Abandoned by Google Fiber are back in the Running to Become Gigabit Cities Angie Communications will start rolling out Smart City and Gigabit broadband infrastructure in several cities where Google Fiber is no longer an option. Santa Monica, California, February 8, 2017 (Newswire.com) – ​​Angie Communications USA, Inc., a newly launched Internet Service Provider that specializes in Gigabit connectivity, and part of Angie Communications International B.V., the world’s largest telecoms start-up, today announced that it will enter cities where Alphabet/Google has stopped its Fiber-to-the-Home projects. Angie will fill the void that Google left in those markets. Most recently, Angie announced the availability of fiber optic connectivity in 87 cities in the USA where the company has access to almost 10,000 on-net buildings. Angie will roll out its Gigabit Cities projects in those 87 cities and several former Google Fiber cities. Partnering with Angie on their large-scale rollout in the USA is a significant milestone for Bear and one we’re very proud of. Bears experience, track record and our unique scalable operating platform will help drive Angie’s growth and success in the USA. Lance V. Addison, President & Chief Operations Officer of Bear Communications Angie has been developing strategic partnerships with industry players for years, resulting in a unique business model that allows for the “commoditization” of highly coveted 10 Gigabit connections that have – until now – been out of reach for practically all business buildings. Angie’s unique business and deployment model, powered and supported by fiber network operators of all sizes across the nation, makes quick deployment on a massive scale possible. Angie’s 10-Gigabit connections serve as hubs for local wired and wireless services that allow connectivity up to a Gigabit per second to end-users. “Our approach is different from Google Fiber and any other fiber operator,” said Neal Lachman, Group CEO of Angie Communications. “Instead of pulling fiber to millions of premises, which is very time consuming and requires an investment of billions of dollars, Angie capitalizes on the tens of billion dollars worth fiber that is already invested and rolled out by our partners. In the USA, there are more than 30,000 on-net buildings within Angie’s reach, already connected by our partners. Angie wants to connect 100,000 buildings and five million premises with fiber over the next five years.” FCC’s Chairman, Ajit Pai, has recently made specific Gigabit and broadband deployment proposals that will greatly benefit Angie’s nationwide rollout. Referred to these proposals by Chairman Pai on Twitter as to aid the “case for competitive upstarts like Angie“, this is a prime example of Angie’s massive opportunities in the changing next generations communications landscape. When it comes to former Google Fiber cities, Angie’s Master Plan calls for large scale rollouts, starting over the next three to four months in soon to be announced cities. Angie is finalizing its plans with specialist firms will design, build and maintain new infrastructure. One of the selected firms is Bear Communications, LLC (Bear) a leading engineering and construction company that operates throughout the USA. Bear was one of the first companies hired to build the FTTH network for Google Fiber in Kansas City (Google Fiber’s first US market). Bear continued to expand its operation when committing to construct Google Fiber’s network in Nashville. In September 2016, Bear was awarded a 3 year, 1,000 mile fiber optic network construction project with Huntsville Utilities in Alabama.  Commenting on the selection, Lance V. Addison, President and Chief Operations Officer of Bearsaid, “Partnering with Angie on their large-scale rollout in the USA is a significant milestone for Bear and one we’re very proud of. Bears experience, track record and our unique scalable operating platform will help drive Angie’s growth and success in the USA.” In order to create an opportunity for other partners to join Angie’s projects, the company is also launching its Invitation to Tender (ITT) today, making it available for any company that wants to build parts of the Angie projects. More information about the ITT and the process can be found at www.ang.ie/vdr. Farooq Malik, Angie’s COO Americas, stated, “Angie outsources almost everything, relying on local specialists that know the markets inside out. This approach allows for large scale rollouts and quick deployments beyond anything the industry has ever seen before. The infrastructure we are building, with thousands of on-net and new 10-Gigabit buildings, allows for upcoming 5G mobile small cell deployments and the massive backhaul capacity that is going to be essential for the communications industry. More so, residential users get to benefit from Gigabit connectivity, starting at an introductory price of just $30 per month.”  Angie is also offering owners of nearby buildings to also connect them on the Angie fiber network. Gregory Nemitz, Angie’s Group COO, said, “We use the on-net buildings that sign up with Angie as hubs to pull fiber to the near-net or off-net buildings where we can serve tenants an unit owners with wired and/or wireless Gigabit services. This deployment model means that physical construction work in the initial phases of our rollout is limited to the least amount possible. The money we save on CapEx is passed on to our customers in the low pricing structure.” The buildings that end up being connected by Angie (the so-called Angie Buildings), double as backhaul hubs for Angie’s Wireless Extreme service, which is the company’s wireless Gigabit service for city-wide use. At many of its 10-Gigabit buildings, Angie will also install 10-Gigabit Wireless millimeter wavelength units on the rooftop in order to create wireless local backbones. Dr. Mahmoud El-Sherif, Group CTO, said, “The combination of fiber and wireless communication systems in a single communication network will also provide the most efficient and cost-effective networks for future massive applications within Gigabit and smart cities’ communication infrastructures.” Neal Lachman continued, “While all parties are under mutual NDAs and we cannot and do not want to disclose much about the underlying business and deployment model, the proof of our commoditization of 10 Gigabit fiber connections is in the pudding. If a building owner in any of our markets in the USA wants to order the Wired Extreme 10 Gigabit connection now, they can check the online documents and get the ball rolling to have their building connected within three to four months. The building owner will not be charged any money; instead, we’ll focus on signing up tenants as Angie customers.”  For a city overview regarding rollout timing, please visit the City section.

We show you how to keep in touch without it costing you a penny. Use Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, FaceTime, and others to make free phone calls anywhere in the world By Martyn Casserly | 08 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Smartphones are like an electronic Swiss Army Knife for the modern age. But they have one important feature people tend to overlook: they all make phone calls. Now, thanks to various free apps, even this capability has been upgraded as you can now make free phone calls from your phone even if you're abroad. See also: Skype vs FaceTime vs Messenger vs Google Duo How to make free phone calls: Wi-Fi calling For a number of years now there have been ways to make phone calls over the internet through VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) services. Initially these were quite specialist ventures, requiring dedicated hardware, and sometimes proving costly to use. Today the process is seamless, free, and the chances are you already have the apps you need installed on your smartphone. See also: Best cheap phone 2017 Many of the messaging apps we use on iOS and Android devices offer the ability to make audio calls to anywhere in the world without incurring a cost. This is because the conversations take place via Wi-Fi rather than the traditional phone system. If you've ever used Skype or Facetime then you'll know how video calls can be free, well it's exactly the same principle with audio. The advantage of this method is that on most apps you're ringing the person rather than their phone number, so the call could also come through on their tablet or PC, depending where they are logged in at the time. This means you're almost certain to reach them even if they've left their phone somewhere else. You can make free phonecalls on a wide range of apps - including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Facetime, Viber, and Google Hangouts - so we've put together guides on how to achieve this on some of the most popular platforms. Also read: Google Duo vs FaceTime vs Skype vs Facebook Messenger How to make free phone calls: Facebook Messenger Like it or loathe it Facebook is an app that the vast majority of people have installed on their phones. While this might be the thing of nightmares for privacy enthusiasts it has upsides when it comes to free calls. A little while back Facebook introduced a call feature into its Messenger app which allows you to talk to friends who also use the platform. It doesn’t matter where they are in the world, which type of phone they use, or its provider, the only requirements are that Messenger is installed and that both phones are connected to WiFi. To phone your friend (no Tarrant inference intended) open up the Messenger app and tap the telephone receiver shaped icon on the bottom row. You’ll now see a list of the people in your Facebook contacts who have the Messenger app installed. Beside their names are two icons - a phone and a video camera - each of which represent the type of call you wish to make. Those with a green dot next to the phone icon are currently online, but you can try calling anyone on the list as the app will become active when it detects an incoming call. Tapping the phone symbol will begin a free voice call with your contact. Also read: Best Facebook Messenger tips How to make free phone calls: Google Hangouts Just like with Facebook Messenger the Google Hangouts app is a regular favourite for free calls. Android users will often find the app preinstalled on their phones, but if not it's free to download from the Google Play Store. Those of an iPhone persuasion can also use the app, which again is free in the App Store.  Obviously you'll need a Google account to access Hangouts, but as they're pretty much ubiquitous these days we'll assume that you've already set one up at some point in the past. To make a free call on Google Hangouts open the app and then select the contact to whom you wish to speak. You can either tap a previous conversation you've had with them, or tap the plus symbol in the green circle found in the bottom right corner of the screen, choose New Conversation, and then search for their details. The recipient will need to have Google Hangouts installed on their phone, but this will be obvious as they won't appear in your list if they don't, and you'll both also need to be connected to Wi-Fi. When you've found the person you're after select them and you'll be taken to any previous message conversations you've had with them. At the top of the screen you'll see options for a video call or an audio call. Tap the latter and Hangouts will begin the free call. At the moment Google has a few different solutions for video calls, with Hangouts and the new Google Duo apps providing a free service. Check out our How to use Google Duo guide for more details. How to make free phone calls: Skype One of the oldest and most popular apps is Skype. In fact due to its widespread use you can often hear people say they've Skyped someone, granting the platform the heady fame of officially becoming a verb. To make a Skype call you'll need to download the app from the relevant store. Skype is a service that you traditionally needed to sign up to, but since Microsoft purchased it this has begun to change. If you haven't yet created an account you might find that Windows 10 has done it for you by linking your Microsoft account.  Reports are mixed on this so be sure to check before you begin. Just like all the other apps on this list you and the person you're calling need to be on Wi-Fi and have the app installed. Open Skype and then tap the contact icon (the one in the middle) at the top of the screen. Here you'll see the people that its possible to call. Some will be displayed with blue circles and their phone numbers under their name. These are users in your contacts that don't yet have Skype. You can invite them by tapping the INVITE option to the right of their names and then sending them a link on the following screen. When you've found another Skype user you want to call tap on their name and you'll be taken to their profile. If you've had text conversations with them before then these will be shown on the screen. At the top of the page you'll see the traditional video and audio call icons. Tapping the audio opens up two options - Skype call and Mobile. The first is free and connects you to the person via the app rather than the phone line. Skype does offer you the ability to call landlines and mobiles for non-Skype users but this is a paid service. Tap the Skype Call option and the phone should start ringing at the other end. See also: How to use Skype How to make free phone calls: WhatsApp The process for WhatsApp is pretty much identical to those listed above. Open the app, search for your contact, tap the phone icon at the top of the screen and you can begin to chat. How to make free phone calls: Apple FaceTime Apple's FaceTime app is a little different to the others on this list as it only works on Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It comes preinstalled on all iPhones and is simple to use. Just open the app, select the + symbol in the top right hand corner, choose the person you want to call, then tap the phone icon to begin the conversation. So there you go, several ways to ensure that you can always keep up with family and friends all over the world. Now there's no excuse. Sorry about that.

LG’s $249 Watch Style lives up to its name, but falls short on features and battery life Posted Feb 8, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Turning great companies into true franchises Android Wear watches are an interesting breed. Because Google mostly locks the operating system down, there are only so many ways the hardware manufacturers can differentiate themselves from the pack. With the launch of Android Wear 2.0 today, Google is giving its partners the option to add usable hardware buttons and dials to their watches. Its launch partner for Wear 2.0 is LG, which is launching two new watches (“designed with our friends at Google”) this week: the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport. The Sport is what you get when you tell a manufacturer to please support every single feature in your operating system, so it features LTE connectivity, a speaker, heart-rate monitor, two buttons and a dial. The result of that is an almost comically gigantic watch with limited battery life. You can read our full review of the Sport here. The Style, on the other hand, is what you get when you pare down Wear 2.0 to its absolute basics. It’s a perfectly stylish round smartwatch that comes with a bunch of different color options both for its bezel and its bands. Its design definitely takes its cues from the earlier LG Watch Urbane line and is also a bit reminiscent of the Fossil Q. It’s 14.2 mm thick, and that’s a good 3 mm thicker than an Apple Watch. Thanks to its tapered edges, the size feels alright, though. Affordable but with trade-offs At $249, it’s the cheapest Android Wear 2.0 watch you can buy right now. But in terms of features, you won’t get much, especially compared to the $200 Wear 1.x watches you can currently get on Amazon and that will likely get Wear 2.0 in the near future, too. True to its name, the Style doesn’t feature any of the advanced features the Sport version offers. That means no heart-rate monitor, no speaker, no LTE, no GPS, no barometer and no NFC support either (so you can’t use it to make payments, which is one of the marquee features of Wear 2.0). You’re not going to go diving with this watch either, but if you’re wearing it in the bathtub, you’ll likely be fine. Its IP67 rating means its dust and water resistant and should survive under water for up to half an hour. If, however, those are things you don’t care about (and personally, I don’t), you still get most of the goodness of Wear 2.0, which now introduces standalone apps, a new interface design and support for dials and buttons. You also still get the same 4GB of drive space on the watch that Sport owners get. That means you can download music to the watch and listen to it with your Bluetooth headphones while you’re on a run (or when you forget your phone at home) — though if you’re a runner, this obviously isn’t the ideal watch for you. As for the screen, I found the touch response a bit twitchy at times. It would often think I tapped something or swiped when that wasn’t my intention at all. I’m guessing that’s something a software update can fix. It’s a nice and bright 1.2-inch P-OLED display, though, with vivid colors and a perfectly adequate 360 x 360 resolution. You do get a genuine leather strap, too, though you shouldn’t expect a very premium feel from it. Indeed, while the watch features a stainless steel bezel (optionally in silver, titanium and rose gold), it feel very light, almost to a degree where you could call it “plasticy.” If you don’t like it, you can easily change it out for another style, though. Welcome to Wear 2.0 After a few hiccups that were due to the pre-release software Google loaded on the devices, using the Style was easy enough. Switching from Wear 1.x to 2.0 does take some getting used to, though. A lot of the muscle memory you may have built up is now useless. You can swipe in any direction to dismiss notifications, for example, and the dial is now far more important than a button ever was on the last-gen Android Wear devices. Indeed, now that you can use the dial to scroll through apps, for example, you’ll probably find yourself tapping the screen a bit less often (though why I can’t scroll and then select an app by pushing the button again is a mystery to me — you can scroll with the wheel, but you still have to tap the app you want to select). The Google Play store on the app — another Wear 2.0 marquee feature — doesn’t offer too many apps yet, but it’s an interesting selection already. I still prefer to select apps and watch faces on my larger phone screen, though. Another headline feature of Wear 2.0 is the tiny on-screen keyboard that you can now use to tap out messages. That works surprisingly well, thanks to Google’s smart typing predictions, but it’s obviously harder on the Style watch than on the Sport version, which features a significantly larger display. All-day battery life for short days One issue that has long plagued virtually all smartwatches is battery life. LG promises “all-day” battery life and, for the most part, that’s what you get — assuming your days aren’t too long. On most days I’d take it off its cradle around 8 am in the morning and come 9 or 10 pm, the watch, with the always-on screen option toggled on, would be down to its last 15 percent — and that’s for days with pretty moderate use. On busier days, it’d long be dead after only 10 hours. I was definitely hoping for more, especially because my Huawei Watch, for example, easily gets me through the day (and often through half of the next day, too). If you turn off the always-on screen, you obviously get better battery life, but I always found this to be one of the nicer features of Android Wear, and I still refuse to wear a watch with a blank screen. The good news here is that the watch does feature wireless charging, so at least you won’t have to try to align it with a randomly designed charging cradle. Ambassador for Wear 2.0 What you get with the LG Watch Style then is a basic Android Wear smartwatch that looks good and won’t break the bank. It doesn’t feature any of the bells and whistles that its more expensive brethren offers, but, for many users, that may not be an issue (do you really need a speaker on a smartwatch, after all). If you don’t need a Wear 2.0 watch right now, though, I’d wait a bit and see what other manufacturers bring to the table. If you do want to buy it right away, the LG Watch Style will go on sale on February 10 at Best Buy and the Google Store. It will also go on sale at carriers and retailers in Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, UAE and UK in the coming weeks. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Android Wear Description Android Wear connects your phone to your wrist.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Google launches Android Wear 2.0, LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport Emil Protalinski@EPro February 8, 2017 9:00 AM Tags: Android, Android Wear, Google, lg, lg watch sport, lg watch style, top-stories As first revealed by VentureBeat’s Evan Blass, Google today launched Android Wear 2.0 and, along with LG, debuted the Watch Style for $249 (pictured above on the left) plus the Watch Sport for $349 (pictured above on the right). The 2.0 software update will be rolling out to all supported Android Wear watches — some 19 devices — in the coming weeks. As for the new smartwatches, U.S. availability starts on February 10 for both: the LG Watch Style at Best Buy and the Google Store and the LG Watch Sport at AT&T, Verizon, and the Google Store. The duo will be available at carriers and retailers across Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, UAE, and U.K. in the coming weeks. Android Wear 2.0 Android Wear 2.0 was revealed at Google’s I/O 2016 developer conference, where the company called it “the most significant update to Android Wear” since the platform launched over two years ago. The final release to users was originally slated for last fall, but was since pushed back until early 2017. Google released five developer previews for Android Wear 2.0, adding features and making improvements along the way. Here’s a rundown of what’s in the final release: Watch faces: You can now personalize always-on watch faces with information and actions from your favorite apps (including your next appointment, stock performance, progress on fitness goals, and so on). A quick tap can order an Uber, start a workout, or get in touch with your significant other, while a swipe can switch your watch face to whichever one you find most appropriate. Working out: Google Fit now lets you track your pace, distance, calories burned, and heart rate (on some devices) as you’re walking, running, or cycling. You can also measure weight-lifting reps, in addition to push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. If your Android Wear watch has cellular connectivity, you can also get calls and messages, stream from Google Play Music, and use apps while working out. Standalone apps: You can download apps directly from the Google Play Store and if your watch has cellular connectivity, you can use them without your phone. This is true whether you have an Android phone or an iPhone. Messages: When you receive a message, you can expand the notification and tap to respond by dictating, typing, or handwriting your answer, or drawing an emoji. Facebook Messenger, Glide, Google Messenger, Hangouts, Telegram, and WhatsApp all support this functionality. Smart Reply, which suggests responses based on the message you received, is also built-in. Google Assistant: The Google Assistant is already available on the Google Home and some Android phones, but now it’s also available on your wrist in English and German (hold down the power button or say “OK Google”). Ask about the weather, set a reminder, make a restaurant reservation, navigate to work, or update your shopping list by simply querying the assistant. Other languages will be made available in the coming months. Google says the following existing watches will be getting Android Wear 2.0: ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Casio Pro Trek Smart, Fossil Q Founder, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Wander, Huawei Watch, LG Watch R, LG Watch Urbane and 2nd Edition LTE, Michael Kors Access Smartwatches, Moto 360 2nd Gen, Moto 360 for Women, Moto 360 Sport, New Balance RunIQ, Nixon Mission, Polar M600, and TAG Heuer Connected. The list will grow, but the focus will naturally be on new products. The first two watches to ship with Android Wear 2.0 are made by LG, designed in collaboration with Google. LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport The LG Watch Style is thin and light, compatible with snap-and-swap 18mm leather and silicone bands out of the box. It has a rotating power button for scrolling through your stream, bringing up the app launcher, and accessing Google Assistant. The LG Watch Sport is meanwhile “Android Wear’s most powerful watch yet,” Google promises. It supports NFC for payments, GPS for tracking exercise and navigation, a heart rate sensor for workouts, and cellular connectivity. It has dedicated buttons for Google Fit and Android Pay, as well as a rotating power button. Last but not least, here are the specs for both Android Wear 2.0 devices: Watch Style Watch Sport Price $249 $349 Storage 4GB 4GB Size 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm 45.4 x 51.21 x 14.2mm Materials 316L Stainless Steel 316L Stainless Steel Strap Italian Genuine Leather Thermoplastic Polyurethane P-OLED Display 1.20-inch, 360×360, 299ppi 1.38-inch, 480×480, 348ppi CPU 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 RAM 512MB 768MB Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Battery 240 mAh 340 mAh Charging Wireless Wireless Durability Water and Dust IP67 Water and Dust IP68 Colors Silver, Titanium, Rose Gold Titanium, Dark Blue ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Thankfully, there are several great ones available. However, there’s not a single launcher on Google Play that can truly replicate the Google Now Launcher’s best feature – a left swipe for Google Now. So, here’s how to add a Google Now gesture to Nova Launcher. Tie Google Now to a gesture on Nova Launcher Nova Launcher is widely known as one of the most customizable launchers on Android today, and thanks to that, you can easily add a Google Now gesture to it. Nova supports several gestures, such as swipes, double taps, and more. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support a swipe to the left or right, so for this example, we’ll use swipe up on the homescreen. Here’s how to set it up. Long-press an empty area of the display and tap Settings Tap Gestures & Inputs Select Swipe Up Swipe to Apps Scroll and select Google Once these steps have been completed, simply go back to your homescreen, and swipe up on any empty portion of the screen. That swipe up will then trigger the Google Search app to open, thus showing your Google Now feed. It doesn’t quite match up with what the Google Now Launcher had going, but it’s clean, fast, and easy to use. Do keep in mind, though, that you’ll need to be a Nova Launcher Prime user, which requires a $4.99 purchase on Google Play.

You can access the app through a swipe, a tap, or even a pinch. In this example, we’ll copy the Google Now Launcher’s gesture with a swipe from the left. Here’s how to set it up. Long-press an empty area of the display and tap Settings Scroll down to Shortcuts Tap Swipe Horizontal Select Leftmost Home Screen Tap App Select Google Once those steps have been performed, head back to your homescreen and make sure you’re on the primary homescreen. From there, simply swipe from the left and the Google app will load up, showing you your Google Now feed. While it doesn’t quite match up with what the Google Launcher had going, this implementation is super clean and even the animations make it feel like a natural integration. Do keep in mind, however, that you will need to be an Action Launcher 3 Plus user, which means you’ll have to pick up an in-app purchase of $4.99 (spoiler alert: it’s worth it). – Download Action Launcher 3 on Google Play Things are even better if you’re rooted All of that is fantastic, but Google Now integration with Action Launcher 3 gets even better if you are rooted. This functionality was added back in version 3.8.1 of Action Launcher 3, and adds completely seamless Google Now integration into the launcher, identical to that of the Google Now Launcher. However, you’ll need to have Action Launcher 3 set up as a system app, which means the device will need to be rooted. Developer Chris Lacy explains this functionality in detail from the feature’s announcement. Google Now integration has been by far and away the most requested Action Launcher feature over the years. The roadblock here has always been the lack of an API from Google allowing other apps to use Now integration. With the recent revelation that Sony’s launcher added support for Now integration, it seems Google are progressing in this area (yay!). But unfortunately at this time, Google have opted to only allow system apps to use Now integration. System apps are the same as a normal app you might install from the Play Store, except they generally come pre-installed on a device. Gmail and Google Maps are examples of system apps on a typical Android phone.

At first glance they may not look all that special, but when you dig in you’ll see that there’s a lot to want here: They’re the first watches to run Android Wear 2.0 (which packs a plethora of new features), the larger of the two will support NFC for Android Pay payments, they both have rotating crowns for a completely new way to interact with Google’s smartwatch platform, and more… There’s a bit of a backstory to today’s announcement. Android Wear 2.0 was originally expected to launch in the fall of last year after its preview which first debuted at Google I/O 2016, but that obviously didn’t happen — Google cited “quality requirements” as the reason for the delay. Now we’re here, Android Wear has had some time to bake a little bit, and Google — along with its partner, LG — is launching a couple co-designed watches “Nexus” style. LG Watch Style and Watch Sport Both watches have 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 processors, nifty new crowns that rotate to control their UI, bodies made of 316L stainless steel covered in Gorilla Glass 3, 4GB of storage space, wireless charging, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth, and three main sensors: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and an ambient light sensor. That’s where they start to differ, however. The first watch, the LG Watch Style, has a 1.2-inch display at a resolution of 360×360, comes in at 10.8mm thick, and will be available in three colors: “titanium,” “silver,” and “rose gold.” It’s a nice looking watch with interchangeable bands (hence the “Style” name), but it’s notably lesser powered. It forgoes Android Pay compatibility and the cellular radio, has a lesser 512MB RAM, a lightweight 240mAh battery, and IP67 water and dust resistance. Second is the LG Watch Sport, which is definitely the “flagship” of the two. The watch has a slightly larger 1.38-inch display at a resolution of 480×480, brings IP68 certification, and will be available in two colors: “titanium” and “dark blue”. The Sport has slightly more RAM at 768MB, a thickness of 14.2mm, and a beefier 430mAh battery. That bit of extra thickness is filled with cellular radios (both 3G and LTE), as well as an NFC chip for Android Pay, support, a heart rate sensor, and GPS. Android Wear 2.0 The real difference with these Android Wear watches compared to those we’ve seen before is that they run Android Wear 2.0. As I said, this was previewed all the way back at last year’s Google I/O, and the key bullet points of what it offers haven’t changed much. There’s personalizable watch faces that let you add complications from your apps, an updated Google Fit that lets you track pace, distance, calories burned and heart rate for a variety of workouts, and of course, Google Assistant. Android Wear 2.0 also lets you download apps straight from your watch via a new on-watch Google Play Store (which will come especially in handy on LTE-enabled watches like the LG Watch Sport). This also means that if you’re an iOS user, you will have access to a lot more apps — those that previously required a paired Android phone to use. Wear 2.0 also expands the options you have for responding to messages with the option to type, use handwriting, or tap a Smart Reply. If you’re only looking to get these new software features, however, chances are that you already have an Android Wear watch that will get the update in the coming weeks. Most of the watches released over the last two years, including the latest Moto 360, ASUS’ ZenWatch 2 & 3, the Huawei Watch, and more will all be getting these features in a coming over-the-air update. Availability The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will both of course be available on the Google Store, but the Style will also be available at Best Buy and the Sport will have variants available at Verizon and AT&T retail stores. If you want to grab the LTE-enabled LG Watch Sport but don’t have Verizon or AT&T, the version that’s available on the Google Store simply needs a SIM card and you’re good to go. You’ll be able to buy them in the US both online and at retail on February 10th, and Google says they’re coming to Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, UAE and U.K. soon.

It has shown what it’s capable of over the course of several developer previews, though, and now Google is releasing Android Wear 2.0 to the public… Android Wear 2.0’s final release doesn’t change a whole lot from what we saw in the developer previews, but adds a ton compared to the latest public release of Wear. Watch faces can now use “complications” to interact with the various apps installed on the watch, and various core Android Wear apps have been updated with improved functionality. Further, the Google Play Store is now available directly on the watch, taking away the need to install apps on your smartphone. This is an especially useful addition on LTE-equipped smartwatches like the new LG Watch Sport and Watch Urbane 2nd Edition. One of the biggest standouts on Android Wear 2.0, however, is the addition of Google Assistant. Since its launch, Assistant has been tied specifically to Pixel devices and Google Home, so this is a welcome addition as Google Assistant could certainly flex its muscles on your wrist. Further, Android Wear 2.0 adds extra options for replies, such as Smart Reply, which offers intelligent responses based on message contents, as well as handwriting and keyboard input. This public release comes along with the announcement of two new smartwatches, the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport. However, what about the current lineup of watches already on the market? Luckily, Google still has plans to update the majority of Android Wear devices that have been released over the past couple of years. The full list follows: ASUS ZenWatch 2 ASUS ZenWatch 3 Casio Smart Outdoor Watch Casio PRO TREK Smart Fossil Q Founder Fossil Q Marshal Fossil Q Wander Huawei Watch (all variants) LG G Watch R LG Watch Urbane LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE Michael Kors Access Smartwatches Moto 360 2nd Gen Moto 360 2nd Gen (Women’s Editions) Moto 360 Sport New Balance RunIQ Nixon Mission Polar M600 TAG Heuer Connected As you can tell, this list includes almost all Android Wear devices. However, there are some notable standouts, mainly older watches. The entire first generation of Android Wear smartwatches such as the LG G Watch, Moto 360, and others are left out. Why? For most of those watches, it doesn’t have to do with specifications, but rather design, as we covered last year. From this point forward, new Android Wear devices should also pack Android Wear 2.0 out of the box. Hopefully, we’ll see some new options from OEMs over the coming weeks, such as the ZTE Quartz that leaked this week. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

These new smartwatches are the first to ship with the updated operating system and were made specifically to showcase new Android Wear features. Now that they have been announced, though, the question is where and when you will be able to purchase these watches… Thanks to a packaging leak that surfaced on Monday, we knew beforehand that LG would be selling their newly released Watch Style at Best Buy. The smartwatch will also be available directly from the Google Store. Both retailers are selling the Titanium and Silver variants of the LG Watch Style for $249.99 while the Rose Gold model will retail at $279.99. The LG Watch Sport has LTE functionality so that it can be used independently of your smartphone. Because of this, the Sport will be available to purchase directly from AT&T or Verizon but you will need to set up a data plan for your Android Wear device. If you are with a different carrier like T-Mobile, you can buy the Watch Sport from the Google Store and then ask your carrier for a SIM card. AT&T will be AT&T will be offering the LG Watch Sport for $50 with a 2-year agreement if you also purchase an LG V20 or G5 on an AT&T Next plan. Alternately, you can buy it from AT&T as a standalone device for $17.50 for 20 months.  Verizon has the smartwatch available for $330 on a two-year contract or $380 for full retail. And lastly, the Google Store will be selling the LG Watch Sport for $349.99 unlocked and without a SIM. Both of the brand new LG smartwatches will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on Friday, February 10. LG Watch Sport Google Store AT&T Verizon LG Watch Style Google Store Best Buy International LG will also be selling both the Watch Sport and Watch Style in Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, UAE. The U.K. Google states the watches will be available through different carriers and retailers across these countries in the coming weeks. Updating with links as they become available.

The software giant isn’t offering much in the way of specifics as far as timing – perhaps not all that much of a surprise, given how long it took to get a date for Wear 2.0’s launch. We do, however, have a fairly lengthy list highlighting precisely which devices will be receiving the update in “the coming months,” and it should make a lot of 1.0 adopters happy. Compatible devices include, ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Casio PRO TREK Smart, Fossil Q Founder, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Wander, Huawei Watch, LG Watch R, LG Watch Urbane and 2nd Edition LTE, Michael Kors Access Smartwatches, Moto 360 2nd Gen, Moto 360 for Women, Moto 360 Sport, New Balance RunIQ, Nixon Mission, Polar M600, and TAG Heuer Connected. The new version of the software includes modular watch faces, a redesigned UI, improved Google Fit, Google Assistant integration and the ability to use Google Pay – though the precise breakdown of functionality will likely vary from device to device, based on hardware limitations. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Android Wear Description Android Wear connects your phone to your wrist.

The LG Watch Sport is the first Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch with built-in LTE. Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-08 17:00:00 UTC There are two kinds of people: Those who are fine with a smartwatch being a "companion" device for their phones and those who want it to replace their phones, at least in some respects. I always thought I would fall into the latter group — because, honestly, who would rather carry around a giant phablet instead of a do-it-all smartwatch? — but after wearing LG's Watch Sport for about a week, I realized I don't actually need LTE in my smartwatch, and you probably don't either. SEE ALSO: 6 things Android Wear smartwatches can do that the Apple Watch can't The $349 LG Watch Sport goes on sale Feb. 10 and is one of two flagship smartwatches Google is launching with Android Wear 2.0. The other is the smaller and cheaper ($249) LG Watch Style.  Though there's no Google branding on the watches  (just an LG logo on the backside), they were very much designed with input from Google, kind of like the Nexus phones were. As such, they're unofficially the new faces of Android Wear and will lead the charge for all Android Wear smartwatches to follow this year. Different, but similar  The Watch Sport ($349, bottom) and the Watch Style ($249, top). Image: lili sams/mashable Design and price aside, the two watches have some key differences.  Let's start with the Watch Sport. It has a 1.38-inch round P-OLED display with 480 x 480 resolution for a total of 348 pixels per inch (ppi). The Watch Sport also has built-in LTE, GPS, NFC  and a heart-rate sensor. And since it's a larger, more powerful smartwatch, it's got more RAM (768MB) and a bigger battery (430 mAh). The Watch Sport has the "Rotating Side Button" a.k.a. Digital Crown clone and two buttons that can be customized to launch any app (by default, they're set to open Google Fit and Android Pay). Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE The Watch Style is the smaller of the two smartwatches, but it's thinner, lighter and comfier to wear. Shame it doesn't have a heart-rate sensor, though. Image: lili sams/mashable In comparison, the Watch Style has a smaller 1.2-inch round P-OLED display with 360 x 360 resolution for 299 ppi. It has none of the Watch Sport's aforementioned wireless capabilities, less RAM (512MB), and a smaller battery (240 mAh).  The Watch Sport is also slightly more weatherproof with an IP68 rating (submersible in up to 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes) versus the Watch Style's IP67 rating (submersible in up to 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes). Another difference: The Watch Sport has a "Rotating Side Button," which works just like the Apple Watch's Digital Crown, and two buttons above and below it. The Watch Style, on the other hand, only has the Rotating Side Button.  LG Watch Style has interchangeable bands. Image: lili sams/mashable At this point, it sounds like the Watch Style is the inferior smartwatch. But that's not true. As its name suggests, it's more for the fashion-conscious — you can swap out the straps, whereas the Watch Sport's rubber strap is non-swappable.  Different as the two watches are, they do share some basics. Both are powered by Qualcomm's 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and come with 4GB of internal storage. Both smartwatch cases are also made of stainless steel and have Gorilla Glass 3 screens for increased scratch resistance. Of course, they have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for connecting to Android and iOS devices.  Leaving the phone behind The Watch Sport's (pictured) built-in NFC supports Android Pay; the Watch Style doesn't have NFC. Image: Lili sams/mashable The Watch Sport looked great until I took it out of the box and chained it to my wrist for a week. The simple, minimalist unisex design caters to both men and women, and if I didn't know any better, I would have mistaken it for a regular watch (especially with the always-on clock mode turned on).  The look screams big, bold and rugged, which I have no problem with, except it's too thick. It feels really chunky — thicker than the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier, which is already a big smartwatch.   The Watch Sport's pretty chunky for a smartwatch. Image: lili sams/mashable Now, I'm not saying big, thick watches can't be good. I'm just saying, for me, the Watch Sport is in a size class that looks ridiculous on my wrist and doesn't fit comfortably. And for a smartwatch, comfort matters a lot. Heck, in reacquainting myself with LG's previous smartwatches, I came across my hands-on with LG's second-generation Watch Urbane, and after a quick comparison, it's pretty apparent LG used it as a model for this device. The Watch Sport's case is simpler and the internal components are all new, but the fit is still painfully bulky. Of course, not everyone will find its thickness a problem. I let a few of my colleagues with larger wrists try the Watch Sport and some of them told me it fit fine. Most of the women who tried it (with big and small wrists), however, said it was just too big for them. So take that for what you will.  The "Rotating Side Button" works just like the Apple Watch's Digital Crown. It's perfect for scrolling through menus and zooming and and out on things like maps. Image: raymond wong/mashable With LTE (works with AT&T and Verizon), the Watch Sport, like the Gear S3 Frontier, works as a standalone device — no phone required. Sure, you can still tether it to your phone, but you're not going to buy this baby to do that.  Aside from the obvious benefits of LTE, like making and receiving calls, and sending and receiving messages, cellular connectivity also lets you download Android Wear apps directly from the Google Play Store and stream music to your wireless headphones all without a phone or Wi-Fi.  For a certain type of user — perhaps an athlete who'd prefer to work out or run without needing to strap their phone to their arm or waist — LTE is a no brainer. And with NumberSync, AT&T customers can sync their existing phone number instead of needing a separate one for the Watch Sport. (Google told me Verizon will offer a similar service to NumberSync in the coming weeks.)  Cellular connectivity worked, but it was hit or miss for me. For some reason the Watch Sport Google provided us with never connected to LTE on AT&T's network, only 4G HSPA+. As a result, downloading apps directly to the watch was slower than through the Android Wear app on my phone. On the plus side, battery life was pretty good: With cellular turned on, the Watch Sport lasted anywhere from a day to two days. Android Wear 2.0  Google took a huge gamble delaying Android Wear 2.0 until this year. I don't know what the reason was and I don't really care, because it was worth the wait. Right out of the gate, Android Wear 2.0 looks and works better on smartwatches with round displays, which means it works great with the Watch Sport and Watch Style.  Android Wear 2.0's new menu UI works so much better on smartwatches with round displays. Image: raymond wong/mashable The menu of apps now has a circular-based interface that scrolls along the edge of the display with a swipe of your finger or a twist of the Rotating Side Button. The interface is also easier on your eyes and helps save power thanks to a darker color palette throughout the entire UI. Previous versions of Android Wear had brighter design, with in-your-face white in places. Using swipe gestures to type out words on the Watch Sport's small screen is surprisingly not terrible thanks to solid predictive text. Image: lili sams/mashable But those are only a few of the improvements you'll find in Android Wear 2.0. Other neat features include the ability to customize watch faces with bite-sized info from third-party apps (similar to the "complications" on the Apple Watch and second-gen Moto 360) and app shortcuts (i.e. sending a text or calling an Uber); write out text either by pecking on a tiny keyboard (terrible) or with swipe gestures (awesome); quickly switch between watch faces with a swipe on the edge of the screen; and auto-activity tracking in the Google Fit app. The Google Assistant works  the same on the LG Watch and LG Watch Style. Image: lili sams/mashable There's also the built-in Google Assistant, activated by a long press on the Rotating Side Button or with an "OK Google" voice command. As far as I could tell, the Assistant works almost exactly like Google Now did on previous Android Wear smartwatches, which is to say, it's handy sometimes, but not something you're going to be turning to much.  Full of compromises I wanted to be excited for the Watch Sport and Watch Style — if only because Google worked very closely with LG to fine-tune them, the Rotating Side Button is super slick, and Android Wear 2.0 is a better experience than before — but I couldn't. Compared to the Apple Watch (Series 1 or Series 2), the two Android Wear smartwatches are still full of compromises.  Sure, the Watch Sport has built-in LTE, but do you really need it? Sure, the Watch Sport has built-in LTE, but do you really need it? Ask yourself: How often are you without your phone? For me, it's almost never, so LTE isn't essential. Unless you're without your phone for the majority of the hours in a day, it doesn't make sense to pay more just to untether your smartwatch from your phone. Plus, the Watch Sport is just too bulky. The Watch Style prioritizes lightness and design, and is the nicer of the two smartwatches, but how does it not have a heart-rate sensor, NFC, or built-in GPS? It's 2017 — there's just no excuse. For an extra $20, you could get a 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 with all of those things. After last year's "break" (most of the flagship smartwatches that dominated 2015 didn't have new models in 2016), Android Wear smartwatches had an opportunity to triumphantly return and up-end the entire smartwatch market, hitting the Apple Watch where it would hurt. The Watch Sport and Watch Style do no such thing. LG Watch Sport & Watch Style The Good Excellent battery life (for a smartwatch) • Awesome rotatable side button • Android Wear 2.0 is so much better than before The Bad Chunky and uncomfortable to wear unless you've got large wrists • No heart-rate sensor, GPS or NFC on Watch Style • LTE isn't a necessity The Bottom Line Despite the LG Watch Sport's power and Watch Style's good looks, both smartwatches are full of compromises that prevent them from competing with the Apple Watch.

Android Wear 2.0 in the new LG Watch Sport. Image: lili sams/mashable By Karissa Bell2017-02-08 17:00:00 UTC Android Wear's second coming is finally here After months of delays and more than a few leaks, Google is finally launching  Android Wear 2.0 with two new watches from LG: the LG Watch Style and the LG Watch Sport, both of which go on sale Friday. The update, which will roll out to more watches later this month, is a complete redesign of Google's smartwatch platform, bringing the Google Assistant and standalone apps to your wrist.  SEE ALSO: Google Maps is getting better at helping you avoid crowds At first glance, what's most noticeable about the new Android Wear is the darker color scheme. Like we saw with the developer previews, the card interface of previous versions is (thankfully) gone and everything, including notifications, is instead set against a dark background.  "We've really tried to simplify things and just make it easier on the eyes but also easier on the battery," Google product manager Jeff Chang said.  Android Wear's new app launcher on the LG Watch Style. Image: lili sams/mashable The user interface itself has also been simplified with streamlined navigation, thanks to what Google has dubbed "rotational input." Most noticeable in the redesigned app launcher, which makes it easier to navigate apps and notifications with a quick scrolling action rather than a series of swipes. On the new LG watches, this takes advantage of a new rotating hardware button that works a lot like the Apple Watch's Digital Crown, but it also works on square watch faces and other older models. Watch faces have also been improved. Now, any app can be accessible from the watch face via a complication (previously, complications were determined by the watch face and not fully customizable). But perhaps the most significant change in Android Wear 2.0 is a new, watch-based version of the Play Store, which allows you to download and run apps independently of your smartphone. If you have an LTE-enabled watch, this completely untethers your watch from your smartphone, at least in theory. Those with non-LTE watches will still depend on a Wi-Fi connection to download apps but having the phone version of the app will no longer be necessary to run the watch's counterpart. This could  be particularly game-changing for iOS users, who until now have been greatly limited with what they could do with an Android Wear watch. The new app launcher organizes apps based on what you have recently used and  "favorites." Image: screenshot/google Android Wear 2.0 allows you to inout text directly from the watch with a gesture-based keyboard. Image: screenshot/google With the change, any developer can now make an Android Wear app that works with iOS. And, running natively on the watch, these apps are all much more useful. You can now use an app like Strava to track your run, get directions with Google Maps or call an Uber from your wrist, While non LTE-enabled watches still won't be able to receive texts and phone calls from iPhones, iOS users will be able to respond to messages from other apps, like Hangouts and Telegram, directly on an Android Wear 2.0 watch. To help with that kind of messaging, Google has added a new keyboard that allows you to to input text via swipe gestures (you can also use gestures to hand-draw emoji or set shortcuts to canned responses). The update also marks the latest expansion of Google Assistant, which is coming to all Android Wear 2.0 devices. The feature works much the same way as it does on Google's Pixel phones and Google Home. You can "wake up" the assistant by either holding down the side button (on the new LG watches) or simply holding the watch to your face and saying "Ok, Google." Google Assistant on the LG Watch SPort. Image: lili sams/mashable Notably, Google Assistant on smartwatches won't speak answers to your queries. This is intentional, says David Singleton, VP of Android Engineering at Google.  "We looked at the kind of places where people are using the assistant and, quite often, you're asking a question to get some knowledge back about yourself, so sometimes it's private information. This is really for much more on-the-go kind of use cases." Taken together, Android Wear 2.0 is without a doubt Google's most compelling update to its smartwatch platform since it launched in early 2014. Will the new features will be enough to truly challenge Apple, however? That's another matter. (Mashable's senior tech correspondent Raymond Wong's verdict is that LG's new watches are no Apple Watch killer, though we haven't been able to test them out with iOS yet.) Still, the long overdue update will no doubt be welcome news to those who have been waiting for it ever since it was announced last year at the Google I/O developers conference, and Android Wear 2.0 will roll out to compatible older watches later this month. Whether or not the update moves the needle for Android Wear, as a platform, depends on the hardware that comes in its wake, however, and how much it sways those in the market away from the Apple Watch. With the smartwatch market in decline and Apple eating most of what's left, that's a tall order. You'd need something like the entire power of Google to do it, but that's arguably exactly what just arrived on your wrist with Android Wear 2.0.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Android Wear 2.0 review: Google's second swing at smartwatches Are Android Wear 2.0 and two new watches from LG enough to get you to care about smartwatches? by Dan Seifert@dcseifert Feb 8, 2017, 12:00pm EST share tweet Linkedin Are you wearing a smartwatch? Not likely. Despite the fact that modern wrist computers have been available for over three years, most people have not found them to be as desirable or necessary as the ubiquitous smartphone. They’ve gone from being "the next big thing" to becoming just another thing, and not a thing most people want. That, of course, hasn’t stopped companies from trying to sell them to you. If you are wearing a smartwatch, odds are it’s either an Apple Watch or a Samsung Gear. Google’s been in the smartwatch game since 2014, but its Android Wear platform has yet to break out of the niche and into a mainstream audience, even though it’s been offered on countless watch designs over the years. So last year, Google went back to the wearable drawing board to develop Android Wear 2.0, the biggest update to the platform since its launch. Wear 2.0 has a simplified design, new features, and, perhaps most importantly, more ways it can work independently of your phone. It’ll even let you do nearly as much with an iPhone as you can when the watch is paired to an Android device. Wear 2.0 is launching first on a pair of new watches from LG that were designed in conjunction with Google: the $349 Watch Sport and the $249 Watch Style. And if you happen to be one of those people who did buy an Android Wear watch before, it’s likely coming to your wrist, too. The Watch Sport and Watch Style are meant to showcase all of the new features found in Wear 2.0, from Android Pay, to LTE connections, to the improved Google Assistant. They are the cutting edge of Google-powered watches, but they won’t be alone for long — you can expect many more Android Wear watches running the platform to arrive this year. The changes here make Google’s smartwatch platform modern and capable enough for those that already know they want to wear a wrist computer. For everyone else, is there enough here between Android Wear 2.0 and LG’s new watches to convince them? The only way to tell is to strap on these new watches, so I did just that. Smartwatches were originally pitched as newfangled computing devices that would free us from looking at our phones so often. But they’ve proven to be best at simple things: tracking fitness, showing notifications, and displaying little bits of information on the watchface, such as the current weather or an upcoming calendar appointment. Android Wear 2.0 is designed specifically to improve upon those simple things. It has better fitness-tracking features, including automatic workout detection, easier access to your notifications, and customizable complications on the watchfaces. It’s a pattern followed across the industry — Apple’s watchOS 3 update from last fall similarly focused on these specific functions. Android Wear 2.0’s support for LTE also builds upon those existing functions. Most often, if you are wearing the watch and don’t have your phone with you, it’s because you’re out for a run and carrying around your smartphone is cumbersome and awkward. Android Wear 2.0 means you don’t have to give up any connectivity to do so, letting you track your run, receive notifications, look up a map, buy something at a store, and send a message or make a phone call all while your phone and wallet are back at home. LG Watch Sport The Sport is the watch that has all of the hardware to support these new functions. It’s loaded with support for LTE connections, NFC for Android Pay, GPS and a heart rate monitor for run tracking, and a speaker for phone calls. LG Watch Sport 1.38-inch P-OLED, 480 x 480 pixel display Ambient light sensor 316L stainless steel Gorilla Glass 3 Thermoplastic Polyurethane strap 1.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor 768MB RAM 4GB storage 430mAh battery Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS NFC (for Android Pay) IP68 dust and water resistant Titanium or Dark Blue colors $349 As a consequence of all of this stuff, the Watch Sport is a big watch. Its name should be a dead giveaway: this isn’t the type of watch that pairs nicely with a dress shirt or formal occasion (and it doesn’t fit under a good number of my shirt cuffs). It’s a big, honking timepiece on your wrist that’s thick, chunky, and has a stiff rubber strap that can’t be swapped out. It isn’t particularly comfortable to wear, either, even on my medium-to-large sized wrist. (Big watches don’t necessarily have to be uncomfortable: the absurdly priced Tag Heuer Connected is a big watch that’s remarkably easy to wear.) The Watch Sport is a big, honking timepiece That large size comes with certain advantages, however, including a big, sharp display (the entire face, bezel included, is roughly equivalent to a 46mm analog watch) and three buttons with a rotatable crown. The fully circular display (no "flat tires" here) has an ambient light sensor for automatic brightness adjustment and can be easily read outdoors. The watch body is encased in stainless steel and there’s Gorilla Glass 3 covering the screen. You can’t go swimming with the Watch Sport, but it does have IP68 weather sealing, so it’s fine to get wet or wear in the shower. Two of those buttons are customizable — by default the top one launches Google Fit’s workout detection and the bottom one is set to fire up Android Pay. The middle button is the most interesting one, though, as it is your main interaction point with the watch (aside from the touchscreen). Push the button and you get a list of your apps, push it again and you’re back to the main watchface. Spin it and you can pull up the notification tray, scroll through text or your list of apps, or zoom in or out on a map. It’s a complete copy of the Apple Watch’s Digital Crown, but it’s both convenient and easy to use. It might just be my favorite thing on these watches. LG Watch Style On the other end of the spectrum from the Watch Sport sits the Watch Style. While the Sport is loaded with features, the Style is largely stripped of them: it lacks LTE, GPS, NFC for Android Pay, a heart rate monitor, and a speaker. Basically, it’s the same watch you could buy two years ago from Motorola or Huawei, but slightly smaller and with a nicer display. It’s much smaller and thinner than the Sport, and is significantly more comfortable to wear. Instead of a fixed rubber strap, the Sport comes with a leather strap that can be easily swapped out for something else (using either Google’s Mode system or a standard 18mm watch strap). The Style’s smaller screen is still fully circular, has the ambient sensor for automatic brightness control, and is just as readable outdoors as the Sport’s. LG Watch Style 1.2-inch P-OLED, 360 x 360 pixel display Ambient light sensor 316L stainless steel Gorilla Glass 3 Italian leather strap 1.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor 512MB RAM 4GB storage 240mAh battery Wi-Fi Bluetooth IP67 dust and water resistance Silver, titanium, or rose gold colors $249 ($279 for rose gold) But while the Sport echoes the look of other aggressive watches, the Style just looks kind of cheap. It has a large bezel around its display that makes it look even smaller than it is, and the mirrored finish on the sides clashes with the matte finish on top. The Style doesn’t have the two extra function buttons found on the Sport, but it maintains the rotating crown, which works the same here as it does on the bigger watch. The Watch Style just looks cheap Both watches have responsive performance for their interface, but apps can still take a long time to load, especially if they haven’t been updated to support Wear 2.0. Even Google’s voice-powered Assistant, which can be used to look up information, send messages or place calls, or control smart home gadgets, still takes a frustratingly long time to respond and process. And finally, the battery life for both watches is well... not great. The Watch Style is able to make it through a full day for me, starting around 7AM and just lasting until I go to bed around 10PM. That’s not as good as I’ve seen in other smartwatches, including other Android Wear models, and doesn’t provide a lot of confidence that the Style will be able to handle any variations in my routine. The Watch Sport is even worse: it frequently would tap out before the end of the day, sometimes at 5PM, sometimes at 8PM, and that’s without using the GPS to track a run or do anything out of the ordinary. My colleague Dieter Bohn has also been testing the Watch Sport and has seen better battery life than I did, but it’s clear that the Sport’s extra capabilities are taking a toll. Either way, these are smartwatches that you’ll be charging every night and maybe even more often than that, which is unacceptable. Android Wear 2.0 But specs and performance aside, the raison d'être for these watches is to showcase Android Wear 2.0. There are a lot of new features in Wear 2.0, but the ones that matter the most are its refreshed design, redesigned watchfaces, improved fitness tracking, notification handling, support for Android Pay, and the ability to install apps directly to the watch. The new design is a welcome update over Wear’s previous versions. It’s simpler and more obvious to use, with less reliance on hard-to-find gestures. There’s your watchface, which you can swipe left or right on to change; your notifications, which you swipe up from the bottom to see; your settings, which you swipe down from the top to access; and your list of apps, which pop up after a single press on the watch’s main button. You can launch the Google Assistant with your voice (the familiar "OK Google" command), or by long-pressing the button. And that’s all you need to know to use an Android Wear 2.0 watch. Customizable complications are one of the best new features You might want to learn how to customize your watchface, though, because it’s one of the best new features in the platform. Watchface complications can now support third-party apps, so you can have one displaying current weather conditions, stock prices, nearby places, or a favorite contact. Android Wear has long offered third-party watchfaces, but third-party complications were always missing. Now you can have both. (Google’s almost comical wrist gestures are also still available for one-handed control, but they are disabled by default.) Since fitness tracking is one of the main reasons people actually do buy and wear smartwatches, Wear 2.0 has improved its features greatly. Watches with GPS, like the Wear Sport, can track locations without the aid of a phone, and the Google Fit app can automatically detect workouts and even give you guidance on proper technique for various exercises. Notifications, the other big thing smartwatches are useful for, are easier to access and manage in Wear 2.0. Like notifications on Android phones, they are grouped by apps and have actionable options, like deleting an email or replying to a text message. Google has included a Smart Reply feature that provides contextual canned replies based on which app you’re using and what time of day it is (i.e., a Slack reply will provide business-focused options like "I’ll take a look after lunch," while an SMS reply at the end of the day might be "How was your day at work?"). If none of the canned responses suffice, you can dictate a reply or use Wear 2.0’s new tracing keyboard and handwriting recognition, both of which are surprisingly useful and accurate, silly as typing on a tiny screen may seem. Android Pay finally brings Wear up to speed with Apple and Samsung Android Wear has lagged behind both Apple and Samsung in providing a way to buy things with your watch, but Wear 2.0 rectifies this with support for Android Pay. It works just like Apple Pay on the Apple Watch: it’s NFC-based and can be used at contactless readers at point of sale. Push a button, Android Pay loads up, and then you can tap your watch to the reader to pay for your purchase. The whole process is a bit awkward for both you and the cashier, and while it worked numerous times in my testing, launching the Pay app on the watch often takes longer than I’d want to wait. But the bigger hitch is that your watch needs to have NFC to use Android Pay, which none of the existing models have and only one of LG’s new watches offers. Android Pay might be the best reason to buy an Android Wear watch this year: it’s something I definitely like having on my wrist and gives me another reason to charge and wear a smartwatch every day. The biggest, most conceptual change in Wear 2.0 is how the system handles apps. Prior to this, the only way to install apps on a Android Wear watch was through an Android phone, and there was no way to corral which apps were installed on the wearable. And if you had your watch paired to an iPhone, you couldn’t install third-party apps on it at all, making it a glorified step counter. Wear 2.0 solves this problem by letting you install apps directly on the watch itself. There’s an actual Google Play Store on the device which lets you browse and download apps and watchfaces. Looking for and installing an app on a screen the size of a quarter is exactly as tedious as it sounds, but fortunately you can use the Play Store’s website on a computer to remotely install apps to the watch. Apps can be installed from the Play Store on the watch itself You can have different apps on your watch than your phone, so if The Weather Channel is the only weather app with a Wear complication (as was the case during my test period), I can still rely on Dark Sky on my phone without a redundancy. Developers will need to update their apps to support this functionality, so for a while, a lot of apps will work the way they always have. But you don't have to worry about them automatically installing to the watch if you don't want them there. (Bye, Delta’s terrible Wear app.) If you are using a Wear 2.0 watch with an iPhone, you’ll be able to install apps on the watch without having to go through Apple’s App Store. This makes Android Wear a much more feasible option for iPhone users than before, but it still doesn’t support iMessage, so not everything is golden. Android Wear 2.0 is also buggier than it should be, especially given the fact that it had an extended public beta period and its launch was delayed by months. Beyond them taking a long time to launch, it can be hard to tell when an app is actually launching, because the screen will flicker back to the list of apps before it will launch the one you just tapped. The Google Assistant also crashed often, forcing me to repeat my inquiry multiple times (or more likely, I just get frustrated with it and pull out my phone). There’s no doubt that Android Wear 2.0 is a nicer, friendlier, easier to use system than before, especially if Google irons out those niggling bugs mentioned above. And the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style are good, if not quite perfect, vehicles to showcase the platform. But Wear 2.0 is less of a reinvention and more of a refinement, and in a lot of ways, it’s just Google playing catch up to what Apple and Samsung were already doing. Nothing here changes the conversation around smartwatches If you were already on board with smartwatches, and Android Wear, you’ll certainly like Android Wear 2.0 and you’ll probably be into these new watches from LG. Smartwatch and fitness enthusiasts both have a lot to like here. But Android Wear 2.0 and the Watch Sport and Watch Style don’t change the conversation around smartwatches and don’t really give a great reason for the unconverted to jump aboard. Which means that the next time someone asks "Are you wearing a smartwatch?," you’ll likely have the exact same response as now. Update February 8th, 2:20PM ET: App install behavior clarified.

You’ll see it on watches new and old, round and square, big and bigger, ugly and uglier. Wear 2.0 offers many things, but this update mostly sharpens Google’s vision for smartwatches. It makes your watch a better tool for fitness and texting, makes the interface far easier to navigate, and puts Google Assistant on your wrist. Most importantly, it makes everything you do with it faster. Much faster. It's Complicated Google evidently realized that the best place to put glanceable data is on the first screen you see when you glance at your watch. Who knew? Android Wear now includes complications: the little widgets on a face that let you see your calendar, open an app, or add a cup of water to your total for the day. That last one really exists, and I find it kind of great. App developers can make their data available to complications, and face designers can decide how to use it.

Assistant Is Listening The future of Android Wear aligns closely with the future of Google Assistant. Going forward, you’ll see watches with a clickable, scrollable crown you long-press to activate Assistant and check the weather, send texts, set reminders, and more. Assistant responds with little typed cards on your wrist—odd, yes, but better than having your watch read texts aloud. I found Assistant a little slow on the watch and more error-prone than on my phone, but it does the job. Credit: Android The future of Android Wear aligns closely with the future of Google Assistant.

Notifications Are Sane Again People who like smartwatches tend to be the always-on, hyperconnected, Type-A people. People who like that their watch buzzes to get their attention even when their phone isn’t nearby. Wear 2.0 refines all those notifications, so that instead of a huge card that takes over the screen you see a small icon pop up at the bottom. Tap it and you go to your notification; ignore it and you go about your day. Credit: Android People who like smartwatches tend to be the always-on, hyperconnected, Type-A people.

Google Fit, which powers Android Wear’s health capabilities, is finally up to the task. Your watch can now detect that you’re working out, and even figure out when you switch from push-ups to squats. Third-party apps can read and write data from Fit, too, so if you switch to Runkeeper you won’t lose your decade of Nike+ data. For most things, you won’t even need a third-party app. You can just open Fit, pick “sit-up challenge,” and go to work. Credit: Android For most people, smartwatches are glorified fitness trackers.

One Watch, Many Faces Google imagines you might use one watchface for the workday, with your calendar and a more formal clock. Then when you go home, you swipe over and the silly face with a picture of your kid and music controls appears. Rather than use two watches, you wear one watch with two personalities. Once I set it up, I really liked it. I even created a third workout face, with all my stats one tap away. I don’t have kids, so I just used a picture of Kevin from Home Alone. I highly recommend it.

Ditch Your Phone Since Android Wear now includes Google’s Play Store, you can download apps from your wrist, to your wrist. All the scroll-scroll-scrolling is tedious, but it works. You don’t need to install an app on your phone just to get it on your watch. Your watch can also connect directly to Wi-Fi—or even LTE, if you get the giant LG Watch Sport. Once you go through the first setup, you hardly need your phone anymore. Which means if you, dear iPhone user, want a smartwatch but don’t want an Apple Watch, you finally have other options. Android Wear mostly just treats your phone as a router, so it doesn’t care which phone you’re using.

Apps open more quickly, notifications are more efficient, even games feel semi-playable. But faster doesn’t mean fast. My two watches take eons to boot, and apps like to spin a bit before loading. Evidently Google can’t find room within the tiny bezels for truly powerful processing. Credit: Android Virtually every single thing about Wear 2.0 is faster than before.

You can reply with your voice, which is good and reasonable. You can use emoji, or Google’s canned responses, which work fine. You can scribble letters one at a time on the screen. Or you can use the on-screen keyboard, because somehow Google decided it was a good idea to put a 26-letter keyboard on a teeny tiny screen. It’s more usable than I expected, but not really usable at all. Credit: Android Google thinks smartwatches are great for texting. So it gave you 100,000 ways to do it.

Round Watches Are Better Watches Google won’t explicitly say so, but it clearly made Wear 2.0 with the idea that most smartwatches are going to be round from now on. The slightly curving app drawer, the way notifications are presented, even the watchfaces themselves are clearly made with round screens in mind. Which is great! Round watches fit better next to that weird bone you have on your wrist, and tend to look better anyway.

The slightly curving app drawer, the way notifications are presented, even the watchfaces themselves are clearly made with round screens in mind. Which is great! Round watches fit better next to that weird bone you have on your wrist, and tend to look better anyway. Still No Killer App After two-plus years of watching people use Android Wear, Google has a pretty good idea of what people do on their smartwatches. Yet even Google doesn’t seem to know what a smartwatch’s future is. Wear 2.0 doubles down on all those things, and makes them mostly better. What it doesn’t do is make any kind of new case for why the non-smartwatch-owning masses should suddenly jump on board. There’s nothing radically new here, no exciting take on the future. It’s just a really good fitness machine, and a way to text your friends from your wrist. That’s fine, but it’s not going to set the world on fire.

Author: David Pierce. David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 02.08.17. 02.08.17 Time of Publication: 12:00 pm. 12:00 pm Review: LG Watch Style and Sport I’ve worn almost every smartwatch worth the name, and I’m still waiting for that life-changing, never-going-back moment that leaves me incapable of imagining life without one. Instead, I’ve found that smartwatches excel at little things: Checking the weather, remembering where I’m supposed to be, switching songs on Spotify. The best I can say about them is they make life easier a few milliseconds at a time. LG Watch Style and Sport 5/10 Learn How We Rate Wired Android Wear is an improvement across the board. Google Assistant makes lots of sense on a smartwatch. The Style is pretty! The Sport is so... sporty! Tired The best smartwatch would be both beautiful and powerful. One-day battery life isn't enough. Remind me, why are we all supposed to want smartwatches again? Buy It Now   |  LG How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection Everyone else must feel the same way, because Android Wear 2.0, Google’s first big update to its smartwatch platform since it launched in 2014, is all about milliseconds. The new software, coming to watches new and old, big and small, round and square, ugly and uglier, makes everything faster. It turns three steps into two, or one, or occasionally even zero. I’m not here to argue that you desperately need a smartwatch, but if you’ve got one, it’s about to be a lot more fun to use. To coincide with the launch, Google worked with LG on two new smartwatches, the Watch Sport and Watch Style. The Sport costs $349 and does all the smartwatch things and then some. The Style runs $249, does next to nothing, and looks good doing it. Google and LG seem to want to prove Android Wear offers something for everyone. What they show instead is that at least right now, it just might be impossible to build a truly great smartwatch. Pep In Its Step But first, the software. Android Wear 2.0 features huge improvements in almost every category, the result of two-plus years of user testing and bug fixing. You’ll appreciate the refinement provided by small tweaks like the darker (and thus more battery-friendly) interface. Bigger changes, like automatic exercise recognition and a much better Google Fit app, increase your watch’s versatility—Android Wear, with the right hardware, now makes a terrific fitness device. Since Wear now puts the Play Store right on your wrist and runs apps natively, you’ll see better performance and more useful apps, too. Google also included some crazy things, like a full 26-letter keyboard for texting. From your watch. Because you hate yourself. Android Wear, with the right hardware, now makes a terrific fitness device. Everything’s been cleaned up and refined. Like Apple with WatchOS 2.0, Google basically shrank Android Wear. Used to be, things moved up and down and sideways, and you could never figure out where you were and how to get back. Now it all moves up and down. You scroll with a finger on the touchscreen or by spinning the crown you’ll see on every Wear device. You can find settings more easily, and your most-used apps, too. But most of the time, you can just long-press the crown, and ask Google Assistant instead. All that said, you won’t find anything profoundly new and wonderful here. Android Wear 2 doubles down on the best things about Google’s smartwatch software without making a new case for why you might want a smartwatch in the first place. Less is More, Except When It’s Less Choosing between the $249 LG Watch Style and the $349 Watch Sport comes down to one question: Do you want the pretty one or the powerful one? More Android David Pierce What If We Told You Smartwatches Are Actually Getting Good David Pierce Review: Google Pixel Lily Hay Newman Never Ever (Ever) Download Android Apps Outside of Google Play David Pierce How to Switch to Android Without Missing iMessage Watch Style, the pretty one, looks almost … normal. At 11 millimeters thick and 42 millimeters across, it feels a lot like a chunky watch. It offers the water- and dust-resistance of an iPhone, without looking rubbery or goofy. I found it light and thin and comfortable enough that no one looked askance at it, or even noticed it. I don’t care for the rigid, cheap leather band, but I quite like the look of this watch. I found the Style’s 512 megs of RAM and 4 gigs of storage plenty for most basic tasks. But that’s the problem: the Style only does basic things. There’s no room in anything this small for NFC chips, a cell radio, or even a heart-rate monitor. You get the Assistant stuff and the apps stuff and the notifications stuff, but nothing above and beyond. The Sport, on the other hand, goes 100 percent above and beyond. It gives you everything: NFC, heart rate, GPS, LTE, barometer, heavy-duty waterproofing so you can swim with it. It features three buttons, two more than the Style, which make it easy to quickly start a workout or turn on Android Pay. Not only can the Sport connect to your phone, it could replace your phone. Of course, packing all of that in made the Sport 45.4 millimeters in diameter, more than 50 percent thicker than the Style, and approximately as heavy as my car. (Silver lining: You’ll get a workout just by wearing it!) If I saw you wearing this watch, I would assume you just finished an Ironman. LG created a fantastic fitness device. It’s just way too much for anything else. Rather than build a Camry, LG decided on a Hummer H2 and a Vespa. Each will appeal to a few people, but neither will work for most people. I can’t help but think there ought to be a middle ground here. Maybe the Style with heart-rate, or payment support, so you get at least one thing you don’t already have on your phone. Or a Sport sans SIM card, making it at least slightly less gargantuan. Neither model fixes the biggest, thorniest smartwatch problem: battery life. With fairly tame use, I got 24 hours of battery life, though a workout or phone call sends the battery plummeting. Whichever model you get, you’ll charge it every night. Nobody needs another device to charge every night. It’s All In The Timing All of this suggests that the Goldilocks smartwatch, the one that’s powerful and beautiful and works exactly how I want, remains technically impossible. The Apple Watch comes closest—which explains why the smartwatch market is essentially the Apple Watch market—but even that offers lousy battery life and little utility beyond freedom from your phone. Smartwatches are in their Newton phase. As with Apple’s ill-fated 1993 foray into handheld electronics, you can almost see the potential. An amazing way to chat with friends or jot down notes—once Assistant gets a little better. The perfect tool for staying connected but not distracted—when the system gets smart enough to not buzz your wrist with every extraneous notification. Paying for things and controlling devices with your wrist—when more devices support it. On and on. Smartwatches could be great, someday. Without the Newton, there may never have been iPhone. But smartwatches won’t get there until they look good and do all the things you need and the batteries last days, plural. Right now, every smartwatch requires a fundamental compromise. Buyers don’t want to compromise, and shouldn’t have to. The LG Watches improve upon their predecessors in real ways, but neither provides a convincing argument that you suddenly need a computer on your wrist. Go Back to Top.

Edho Pratama/Unsplash If you already work with a PR firm or are considering launching a media campaign, then you have probably heard of the term “inbound marketing.” What is inbound marketing? Inbound marketing is about empowering potential customers with the information they need to help find your business online. Your goal should be to create focused content that will help solve your prospect’s problem. Think about it. When you made your last purchase, did you call a salesperson asking to buy or did you hop online and conduct thorough research? Chances are, you did thorough research, but when you did research, you didn’t type in a company’s name (because you don’t know the names yet). You were Googling the problem you had. When your prospect searches for their problem, your company needs to be on page one so that the buyer sees it as a solution. Tip: Imagine yourself as a potential customer of your own business. Go to Google and search the problem as if you were your own customer. Does your company show up on the first page on or near the top? Positioning your business on or near the top of a Google is one of the main goals of inbound marketing. How do you get started with inbound marketing? Figure out your buyer persona. Who are they? What information is most valuable to your prospects? How do they like to consume information? Once you have determined who your buyer persona is, you can then focus on creating keyword-rich content to reach them. If you are still wondering, “How can I engage my current customer base more?” you can always ask current clients some of these questions. Their answers can prove to be invaluable in the upfront research. Remember, your job is to deliver information that prospects need to help them make smart, informed purchase decisions. When thinking about the motives of buyer personas, focus on the ‘why.’ Uncovering their motives can lead to a powerful content strategy. Try interviewing current clients and look for trends in their responses. It’s your job to know what they want to see, what they want to read, and what issues they are currently dealing with. Tip: Here’s a trick to see if your most current blog posts are hitting your buyer persona(s). Search Google for the last five blog posts your company has created. Now search for five of your most ideal clients online (go to their websites and poke around). Do you think these types of ideal clients would actually take the time to sit and read these five blog posts from your company? Are you really providing solutions or just repeating the same old brand stories? Put the education of your prospect first. Creating Content With inbound marketing, your customers don’t want to be “sold” to. They want to be educated. It is your job to “talk” them from the decision stage to a solution strategy. Your content should focus on a methodical approach to learning more about your company, buying your products and/or service and then using them. So, make certain you have content prepared for every part of your buyer’s journey. Tip: When it comes to inbound marketing strategies, your job is to make it easy for current customers and potential buyers to consume your content.  Keywords Keyword research is critical to clearly giving a name to the prospect’s problem. Remember, think about the phrases that prospects are using to find someone who offers your services, instead of thinking about what you would use. Try not to use too much industry jargon either. CTA (Call to Action) Every blog post should also have a call-to-action, or CTA. Examples of calls to action include: download, request, sign up, and receive. When writing your CTA, focus on action verbs. Awareness, Consideration, Decision After a prospect is aware of their problem, they are in the consideration stage and are committed to understanding all available methods to solving the problem. You want to make sure you reach your prospect in the consideration stage by creating keyword-rich content. Remember, consumers don’t want to be sold to; they want to be educated. Once they are in the decision stage and have decided on a solution strategy, they are focused on the method of approach. It is important to have content prepared for each stage of the buyer’s journey. Tip: After you write or approve any content, ask yourself this: Does this content help your ideal buyer persona(s)? Your content should always focus on mapping content to your persona and where they are at in the buyers’ journey.  Avoid Inbound Marketing Mistakes The buyers journey has to be from the buyers’ perspective, not yours. Your content needs to answer their problems vs. going straight to your business solution. Your blog shouldn’t even begin to discuss your specific solution until the decision stage. Content Creation Tips Understand their problem: In order to provide a solution to potential customers, you need to first recognize the problem. Ask yourself, is your content focused on their problem? Tailor the post: Write blog posts tailored to who you are trying to reach and what they are interested in. The best content has to be grounded in the correct context. Question the post: After you write content, ask yourself if the content helps your buyer persona. If your answer is that it helps anyone other then your persona, it belongs somewhere else or shouldn’t be created. Akways focus on mapping content to your persona and where they are at in the buyers’ journey. Make it easy for them to consume your content. Another trick: If you are stuck creating content, ask yourself this: What questions might buyer X have that your company could provide solutions to?  Distribute content: Make your content available through other platforms so prospects can find it more easily. It’s not enough to just have content. You need others to re-distribute it. Leverage sales for content mapping: What questions do people have who are interested in what you do? Work with the sales team to leverage prospects’ questions into great content! Figure out what your prospects are searching for so you can make sure they find your site. Make sure you are addressing a topic your prospects actually want to learn about. Categorize keywords: Do this by stages of the buyer’s journeys. Keywords should include: problem-based keywords, solution keywords, branded keywords, and casual language. Use keywods.io or Google’s webmaster tool to get suggestions. Tips for Optimizing SEO To optimize your content, you need to be specific with your service offerings or else SEO will be more difficult. It is easier to rank if your keywords are more specific and targeted. If you are looking to quickly boost your SEO, be sure to set up business pages on the top online directories including Yelp, Yellow Pages, local chambers of commerce, bing, Yahoo, Google plus, and more. This will help increase links back to your site. Create content that uses natural language and variations on the long tail keyword. Shorten blog or content titles to under 60 characters. Headlines more than 60 characters long will get cut off in search results page. White space is your friend. Focus on content, not clutter. Use section headers, bullets and lists to help break down the content. Optimize the page around long tail keywords, including your page title, URL, post title, image alt text, body and headers.  Measuring Success It’s also important to measure the success of your content strategies. Focus on the following metrics and start a monthly “content measurement” report: Number of page views and visits per blog or other content posting including time spent (if possible) Leads generated from specific blogs/content posts Social media share numbers Inbound link generation analytics Kris Ruby is the CEO of Ruby Media Group, a Public Relations and Social Media Agency.

Paul Rubens (CIO (US)) 09 February, 2017 03:15 - - - - print email Comments Eight years ago, the CyanogenMod project exploded onto the mobile device software scene. The Android-based open source mobile operating system quickly caught the attention of developers, Android fans and investors, and attracted interest from tech giants including Microsoft and Google. But at the end of last year the project imploded spectacularly.  Today the CyanogenMod project is no more, but the arc of its story offers fascinating insight into the world of open source software development. The project started out innocently enough following the discovery, in 2008, of a way to root mobile phones running Google's Android operating system, allowing modified firmware to be installed on rooted devices. One such piece of firmware was created by a developer called Steve Kondik, whose online handle was Cyanogen — a colorless toxic gas made by oxidizing hydrogen cyanide. The modified firmware was known as CyanogenMod. [ What CIOs don't know about open source software ] Developers are able to create modified firmware because Android is, at its heart, an open source operating system, and pretty soon CyanogenMod became a project with a community around it. At the center of this was a core group of software hackers who became known as Team Douche. The project was hosted on GitHub, had regular releases, and versions were built to support an increasing number of Android devices. One hiccup the open source project encountered at the tail end of 2009 was a potentially serious legal problem. Android firmware for most mobile devices includes the open source Android operating system as well as a group of proprietary Google apps (collectively known as GApps), including Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, and Google's Android app store (which is now called Google Play.) Google licenses these GApps for inclusion in vendors' firmware, but they are not freely available for inclusion in modified firmware such as CyanogenMod, as Google explained in a blog post at the time. As a result, Kondik received a "cease and desist" letter from Google asking that the GApps be removed from CyanogenMod. That was a serious problem because the ability to run those GApps is a significant part of the attraction of Android. Without them, and particularly without Google's app store, an alternative firmware distribution is severely diminished. It's worth considering at this point that Google's approach to Android isn’t unique, although it is slightly different. Many commercial organizations offer free open source software and also sell a product based on that open source code that includes proprietary add-ons that extend the functionality, as well as additional services, such as support. A good example is Kubernetes, a Google-incubated container management and orchestration tool that forms the basis of many commercially available container management systems such as CoreOS's Tectonic platform. Where the situation with Android differs is that Google doesn’t sell its GApps to monetize Android. (Instead, it uses Gmail and YouTube to generate advertising revenue, for example.) In the face of criticism from developers and others in the open source community, Google changed tack and said that the proprietary GApps could be backed up from a phone's original firmware and then reinstalled with CyanogenMod. (Today, an app called OpenGApps, which, ironically, is available on Google Play, makes it easy to install GApps onto a modified firmware that does not include them.) Then, in 2013, Kondik decided a change of approach was needed for CyanogenMod to continue to thrive.  He started a venture-backed business he called Cyanogen Inc. as a vehicle to commercialize CyanogenMod. Seventeen employees were based at two offices: one in Seattle and the other in Palo Alto. Kondik outlined his motivation in a blog post: "What we have with CM (CyanogenMod) could not have happened any other way — a huge community came together and created something awesome that did not exist before, because it was needed." "We have had some serious growing pains though, and scaling with this kind of growth has been incredibly hard. What could we build if all the barriers were removed and we could dedicate our time to it?" The backer that put up $7 million in the Series A funding round for Cyanogen Inc. was Benchmark Capital, a company that also backed such well-known open source companies as Red Hat and HortonWorks, a company that sells a commercial version of the open source big data analysis project Hadoop.   Terri Haas for CIO Now, Red Hat and HortonWorks appear to have built thriving businesses based around open source software, but it's not clear that Cyanogen Inc. was able to generate significant revenues in the first months of its existence from its commercial product, Cyanogen OS. This was a firmware distribution based on CyanogenMod but with additional proprietary apps such as Google Play and a collection of its own apps including AudioFX, Gallery, Theme Chooser and Themes Store, known collectively as C-Apps. That's despite CyanogenMod boasting a user base in excess of 10 million and forging licensing deals with Chinese phone makers Xiaomi, OPPO, and OnePlus (which is connected to OPPO) to use Cyanogen technology. Now here's where things get slightly bizarre. In October 2014 it was reported that Cyanogen Inc. had rebuffed overtures from Google about a possible acquisition. Instead, Cyanogen was valuing itself at close to $1 billion and was seeking investment from major tech firms. Then, at the start of 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft was about to invest in Cyanogen, leading to speculation that Microsoft was planning to abandon its failing Windows-based mobile platform and use something based on CyanogenOS as the basis for possible new Android-based Microsoft phones. This never happened, but Microsoft did launch an initiative to get its applications and services running on Android, and in April 2015 Cyanogen announced a partnership with Microsoft which involved Microsoft apps and services being integrated into Cyanogen OS. Later, (following the 12.11 update) Cyanogen OS started suggesting Microsoft apps and services in the "open with" menu when the operating system encountered file types it couldn't already handle. In the meantime, the partnership with OnePlus evaporated due to a reported clash of personalities at the two companies, as well as a fiasco in India caused by Cyanogen Inc. signing an exclusive deal for the sub-continent with low-cost smartphone manufacturer MicroMax. This resulted in sales of OnePlus handsets powered by Cyanogen OS being temporarily banned in India. But in 2016 things rapidly went downhill. In the middle of the year a large number of staff were made redundant, and the Seattle office was closed. CEO Kirt McMaster stepped down, and Kondik was removed from the board. In November he officially left the company, and has not responded to a request for comment for this article. Finally, on December 23, Cyanogen Inc. released a curt notice  that read:  "As part of the ongoing consolidation of Cyanogen, all services and Cyanogen-supported nightly builds will be discontinued no later than 12/31/16. The open source project and source code will remain available for anyone who wants to build CyanogenMod personally." The result is that CyanogenMod as an active project is no more — in name at least. The good news for users is that they have not been completely abandoned, because it is a simple matter to switch to an actively maintained alternative firmware or a device's stock firmware. (That contrasts favorably with the situation that can arise if a business relies on an open source project when the sponsor walks away and no obvious alternatives exist.) [ What CIOs need to know about open source forking ] Of course in that situation it is always possible for a company to take the source code and take on the development task itself (or pay someone else to do so), or hope that someone else will take over the project. And that, in fact, is what has happened with CyanogenMod. The code has been forked and a new project, called LineageOS, has been started by some in the CyanogenMod community to continue the CyanogenMod project under a new name, independent of Cyanogen Inc. Continuing a project after it is abandoned by a commercial organization is not without precedent. The LibreOffice project was forked off when OpenOffice was abandoned by Oracle; SuiteCRM emerged after SugarCRM stopped releasing open source versions of its CRM product; and Nautilus (now Gnome Files), the file manager for the Gnome Linux desktop environment, is still thriving long after Eazel went out of business. And something similar happened when MySQL was acquired by Oracle, but in that case it was the developers who abandoned Oracle rather than the other way around, preferring to continue a parallel project called MariaDB. What does the LineageOS project hope to achieve by continuing the CyanogenMod work? It's hard to say for sure as a request for information received no response at the time of writing. One problem that the LineageOS may face is that CyanogenMod was a very complex project, and one that had the benefit of at least a proportion of the estimated $100 million in venture funding. That means that it may struggle unless it finds a commercial organization to sponsor it, says Greg Soper, CEO of SalesAgility, a company that backs the SuiteCRM open source project. "You need expertise, and the will and desire to continue a project (after it is abandoned)," says Soper. "But can a project like LineageOS continue without a commercial organization to help develop it? I have my doubts. I think that the LineageOS project may wither on the vine unless people put money into it." Can a project like Lineage survive and thrive with nothing more than a dedicated community of enthusiasts?

Well wipe the slate clean, because the new LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style make everything else that LG has done in wearables look a little silly. This is a new generation of Android Wear 2.0 devices, built in collaboration with Google. LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style: Design Two designs - sporty or fashion 316L stainless steel cases Digital crown for navigation  LG has launched two new Android Wear watches that have been built in close collaboration with Google. These two devices are the launch devices for Android Wear 2.0, so are designed to showcase the new hardware-dependant features that the software offers. LG Watch Sport 45.4 x 51.21 x 14.2mm Titanium or dark blue colours IP68 water protection The LG Watch Sport is very much the hero device for Android Wear 2.0. It has a chunky and sporty design, with a fixed elastomer strap. The Watch Sport features three buttons to the right-hand side of the casing, which is available in titanium or blue colours. The central button is a digital crown which can be rotated to navigation the Android Wear interface, while the other two buttons default to Google Fit and Android Pay, but can be customised. The back has a pronounced bump which incorporates the optical heart rate scanner. This makes the device rather thick overall, but given the hardware that you're getting, it's not actually that big at 14.2mm thick. The aim of the bump for the optical heart rate scanner is to ensure good contact with the skin, regardless of how you're wearing the watch. You can't change the strap on the Watch Sport as it integrates the LTE antenna. As a sporty device it carries an IP68 rating to keep it safe from running in the rain. We've seen it, we've worn it, and we've played with it, so be sure to read our first impressions. LG Watch Sport preview: The crown prince of Android Wear 2.0 LG Watch Style 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm Rose gold, silver, titanium IP67 water protection The LG Watch Style has a fuss-free and elegant design, firmly focused on the fashion market, carrying an Italian leather strap, which has a quick release mechanism, so you'll be able to quickly change MODE straps. The central button a digital crown allowing navigation of the Android Wear interface and there are no other buttons, unlike the Watch Sport. One of the interesting design details of the LG Watch Style is the slim bezel around the device. This, Google tells us, comes from a custom display with minimal bezels to give a sleeker look. The LG Watch Style is the smaller of the two watches. LG Watch Sport and Watch Style: Hardware specs Sport: 1.38in, 480 x 480 pixel display (348ppi), LTE, GPS, HRM, NFC Style: 1.2in, 360 x 360 pixel display (299ppi) Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 The LG Watch Sport has a 1.38-inch display with a 480 x 480 pixel resolution, making it one of the highest resolution watches so far. The Watch Sport has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 chipset, 768MB of RAM, 4GB of storage and a battery capacity of 430mAh. It also features a heart rate sensor, and offers LTE connectivity, NFC and GPS, for a completely independent experience. The LTE is optional - if you don't insert a SIM card then it will work without LTE. The LG Watch Style has a 1.2-inch display with a 360 x 360 pixel resolution. There's 512MB RAM and 4GB of storage, with a 240mAh battery and it's also powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset. LG Watch Sport and Watch Style: Software Android Wear 2.0 Google Assistant The LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style have been crafted to showcase Android Wear 2.0 in two very different styles. The LG Watch Sport goes the whole hog, offering he LTE-powered disconnected experience, meaning you'll be able to stream your music when out running without the need to have your phone with you.  The LG Watch Style on the other hand offers a sleeker experience, free from all the sporty fuss that is often attached to wearables. This is designed to keep you connected, but without it looking like you're wearing a computer on your wrist. Android Wear 2.0 bring a brand new visual experience to watches, with completely redesigned watch faces allowing for complications, like adding the weather, steps or data from other apps, to keep you informed at a glance. There's also a new menu than you can scroll using that new crown. The crown can also be used in-apps to do things like change the volume or the setting on your heating. Google Assistant is also a major change, giving you Google's context aware AI assistant, so you can find a restaurant, book a table, and navigate there with ease and all through voice control. If you don't fancy voice, there will also be a swipe keyboard with predictive text, as well as quick replies to messages, like those you get in Gmail. Android Wear 2.0: What's new in the major software update for watches? LG Watch Sport and Watch Style: Release date and price 8 February announcement 10 February availability in USA The LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style will be available from 10 February via AT&T and Verizon. Best Buy and Google Store will also be offering the devices. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style will be available in other regions soon, but there's no word on an exact timeframe. The LG Watch Sport will cost $349. The LG Watch Style will cost $249.

Android Wear 2.0 was first announced at Google I/O in May 2016, but its official announcement has followed almost a year later, alongside the launch of these two new devices.  Google confirmed to us that it worked closely with LG in designing these new watches, so they're probably as close to a Nexus watch as you'll get – and that was how these watches where first seen when they leaked.  The LG Watch Sport is very much the hero device, fully-loaded with an LTE connection, meaning you don't need your phone on to use it, as well as NFC, enabling mobile payments through Android Pay, and linked to the bottom button.  The sporty watch also offers GPS and a heart rate sensor on the rear, with a full suite of fitness features accessed via the top hardware button. LG Watch Sport preview: The crown prince of Android Wear 2.0 But the star of the show is the digital crown on the side that supports Android Wear's new rotational input controls. This means you can scroll through menus, turn your Nest up and down and so on, bringing a more visceral experience that the previous touch options.  The second device is slimmer and smaller, designed to give you a smartwatch experience but in a more subtle way. There's no GPS, NFC or LTE and there's no heart rate monitor either: the Watch Style is about giving you the core Android Wear 2.0 experience, with that central digital crown.  What the LG Watch Style does offer, however, is changeable watch straps. Coming with a leather strap as standard, you'll be able to switch it out in seconds if you want a different look. Both watches benefit from a fully-round display, with no flat tyres to be found. The new Android Wear 2.0 software also brings Google Assistant, completely revamped watch faces with complications, rotational input through the crown, quick replies on messages and a whole lot more. Android Wear 2.0: What's new in the major software update for watches? The LG Watch Sport will cost $349; the LG Watch Style will cost $249. Both will be available from Best Buy, Google, AT&T and Verizon from 10 February in the USA. The watches will also be available in Canada, Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, UAE and UK soon.  The Android Wear 2.0 update for existing devices will be available from 15 February.

Unlike the Apple Watch, the experience didn't "just work", it was more a case of "barely worked". There are a lot of reasons why, not least because of the approach that Apple takes to keeping its ecosystem locked down tight, but also because of the lack of Google's Play Store on the iPhone, meaning a dirge of apps. You can read all about the old position on the link below. What's Android Wear really like on iPhone? One of the big changes in Android Wear 2.0 is standalone apps. This means that the app can be installed directly on the watch, which has its own app store. Currently, you'd have to install the Wear compatible app on your Android phone to enjoy it on your watch.  With Android Wear 2.0, your watch will be able to connect itself to the network, either via Wi-Fi or LTE (if and when LTE-equipped watches hit the market), so you can install those apps directly, with no need for a connected device.  For an iPhone user, that means you can install Uber or Strava or Runkeeper on an Android Wear smartwatch, without encountering any problems with your iPhone, as one isn't dependent on the other. Google has confirmed that the following apps will be standalone, so can be used by Android or iPhone users:  AccuWeather Android Pay Bring! Foursquare Google Fit Google Messenger Google Play Music Lifesum Robinhood Runkeeper Runtastic Strava Telegram Uber and many more The interesting app on this list is Android Pay. That's a given for Android phone users, but it appears that iPhone users will at some point in the future also have the freedom to use Android Pay on their wrist, meaning they don't lose out on this convenience feature by not using an Apple Watch.  There's no real telling what the overall experience is going to be like for an iPhone user, and we suspect it won’t be as seamless and slick as it is on Apple Watch, but Android Wear 2.0 could unlock a whole world of variety when it comes to choosing your next piece of connected wristwear.

Britta O'Boyle8 February 2017Smartwatches Google / LG Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment LG has announced two new smartwatches, designed in collaboration with Google. The two devices will be the poster boys for Android Wear 2.0, which launches at the same time, bringing some excellent new features. As their names suggest, the LG Watch Style opts for the fashion route, while the LG Watch Sport goes down the sports path. Here is how the two smartwatches compare in terms of design and specs. LG Watch Sport preview LG Watch Sport vs LG Watch Style: Design Watch Sport bigger Watch Style interchangeable straps Both have waterproofing The LG Watch Sport is the chunkier and more rugged of the two smartwatches measuring 45.4 x 51.21 x 14.2mm with a rubberised fixed strap and stainless steel casing. There are three buttons to the right-hand side of the Watch Sport's circular face, while an optical heart rate scanner sits underneath. The casing is available in titanium and blue colour options and it has IP68 water protection. The LG Watch Style is a little smaller and slimmer than the Sport, measuring 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm with an interchangeable Italian leather strap. It too has a stainless steel casing and it comes in rose gold, silver and titanium colour ways. There is only one central button on the right of the Style's circular display and the bezels surrounding the screen are narrower than the Sport for a sleeker look. It is also water resistant but it offers an IP67 rating rather than IP68. LG Watch Sport vs LG Watch Style: Features Larger display on Watch Sport LTE connectivity and GPS on Watch Sport Heart rate monitoring on Watch Sport The LG Watch Sport has a 1.38-inch display with a 480 x 480 pixel resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 348ppi. It features optional LTE connectivity within the strap, as well as NFC and GPS for an independent experience.  As we mentioned previously, there is also heart rate monitoring on the Sport model with Google Fit accessed easily via the top button on the right of the display. The LG Watch Style on the other hand has a slightly smaller 1.2-inch display with a 360 x 360 resolution for a pixel density of 299ppi. It misses out on the extra features present on the Sport, meaning it's more of a standard smartwatch. LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style: Release date, rumours and specs LG Watch Sport vs LG Watch Style: Hardware Both Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip More RAM on Watch Sport Bigger battery on Watch Sport Both the LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip and 4GB of storage.  The Watch Sport has 768MB of RAM and a 430mAh battery capacity, while the Watch Style has 512MB of RAM and a 240mAh battery. LG Watch Sport vs LG Watch Style: Software Both Android Wear 2.0 Both have Google Assistant Watch Sport can be independent of smartphone Both the LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style run on Android Wear 2.0, offering an entirely new visual experience and interface to what Google's wearable platform used to be. The two new smartwatches also both feature Google Assistant and they both have the digital crown within the central button on the right of their displays for navigating the new interface. The LG Watch Sport also has LTE connectivity however, meaning it can be used to stream music when out and about and take calls if you put in a SIM, without the need for your phone. Android Wear 2.0: What's new in the major software update for watches? LG Watch Sport vs LG Watch Style: Price Watch Style is cheaper The LG Watch Sport will cost $349, while the LG Watch Style will be the cheaper alternative at $249. LG Watch Sport vs LG Watch Style: Conclusion  The LG Watch Sport is the bigger and more feature-rich of the two smartwatches being compared here. It has a larger battery capacity, more RAM, a sharper display and it comes with the extra functions like GPS, LTE and heart rate monitoring. The LG Watch Style on the other hand, allows you to change its strap for a different look and it is also the sleeker and cheaper of these two devices.

Nicole Lee, @nicole 02.08.17 in Wearables Comments 2118 Shares Share Tweet Share Save When Google introduced Android Wear back in 2014, the smartwatch industry was young. The only players worth noting were Pebble, Samsung (with its Tizen-based offerings) and a few other niche options (like Sony's proprietary SmartWatch OS). Google, however, aimed to kick the door wide open with the same approach it had taken with phones: Instead of making both the watch and the software, it would court different hardware manufacturers, cultivating a diverse set of designs along with a robust third-party app ecosystem. Three years later, the bet seems to have paid off. Although it's had to fight off tough competition from the Apple Watch, Android Wear has survived and, according to Google, thrived. "If you compare the holiday season of 2016 with the holiday season the year before, we saw more than 70 percent growth," says Android Wear VP David Singleton (not that that's necessarily saying much). And so with all that success comes time for the second iteration of Google's wearable OS, Android Wear 2.0. It'll be available first on the newly announced LG Watch Style and Watch Sport on Feb. 10th and will roll out to compatible existing hardware in the coming weeks. Gallery: Android Wear 2.0 screenshots | 21 Photos 21 +17 This update, according to Singleton, is the platform's biggest one since the birth of Android Wear, three years ago. "With 2.0, we really looked hard at what people are using their watches for," he said. "We saw that usage was really focused around watch faces, messaging and fitness. So we really optimized 2.0 for those things." But Google improved a lot of other aspects of Wear as well, including the user interface, navigation and notifications. First, let's talk about watch faces. As with the previous iteration of Android Wear, you can swap in whatever face you like, either by selecting it on the companion Android Wear phone app or by adding it directly on the watch. But with Wear 1.0, there was often a trade-off: You could either choose the stylish but barren design or the complex but informative one. With Wear 2.0, however, you can have the best of both worlds. That's because any watch face, as long as it supports complications, can now be customized with data from any app. Swapping out a complication is as easy as long-pressing it and then picking its replacement, which can be anything from calories burned to an app shortcut. As with Wear 1.0, tapping on each complication brings up the related information card. So for example, tapping the calendar launches the agenda for the day, while the step counter shows how much progress you've made toward your 10,000-step goal. And say you want different complications for different times of day -- you want the Nest function when you're at home, but not in the office, for example. You can customize different watch faces for different use cases. Switching watch faces is as easy as swiping left or right on the active watch screen, so you can simply change from one to another depending on where you are. Indeed, the Android Wear team took care to make navigation a priority with the 2.0 update. "We really condensed and simplified things," said Jeff Chang, an Android Wear product manager. "We measured the number of taps and swipes between things, to get that down to as few as possible." So for example, oft-accessed settings are now combined into one display. Swipe down from the active screen and you'll see toggles for airplane mode, Do Not Disturb and as a settings shortcut. One press of the side button launches the app menu, and navigating through the list can be done either via a rotating crown (if your watch has one) or the touchscreen. If you'd rather not scroll through your lengthy list of apps, you can also long-press a favorite to pin it to the top. The menu will list recently accessed apps first, followed by favorites and then the rest by alphabetical order. Notifications have changed drastically as well. Instead of glaring white cards that take up the bottom half of the screen, there are now subtler notification icons. Also, the notifications themselves are now color-coded and contextual. So Gmail notifications have a red background, for example, while Hangouts are green. They only appear when you bring the watch up to your eyeline; a few seconds later, the watch face resurfaces again. If you like, you can access all of your recent notifications by swiping up on the main screen. The watch's overall UI is also much darker. "It's not only easier on the eyes, and it's a lot easier on battery life as well," Singleton says. As for those incoming message notifications, replying is as easy as tapping; do it once and you'll immediately be brought to the reply menu. (Though bear in mind this is the experience on Android; the feature is extremely limited on the iPhone.) In addition to using your voice or drawing an emoji, Wear 2.0 introduces a full-on touch keyboard as well. At first this sounds pretty ridiculous on such a small screen, but it's surprisingly intuitive. You can either swipe through words like you can on Swype or SwiftKey, or you can use handwriting recognition. Either way, I found the word detection to be surprisingly accurate, with only a few errors. Another way to reply to messages is through Smart Reply, which is powered by Google's machine learning. You'll see a list of what it thinks your reply will be depending on the context of the message. Much like the feature of the same name in Inbox, Smart Reply should be able to offer smarter and better responses over time as it learns more about you. Speaking of machine learning, Android Wear 2.0 also finally brings Google's Assistant to the watch. Say "OK Google" or long-press the power button and you can ask all sorts of queries, like "How did the Warriors do against the Cavaliers?" or "How many tablespoons are there in a cup?" or "Is it going to rain today?" It can also be easily integrated with third-party connected devices like the Nest thermostat and Philips Hue lights or services like Uber and OpenTable. Now onto fitness. Android Wear 2.0 has Google's preinstalled Fit app just as before, but the experience is much improved. You can see your calories, pace and distance as you sweat it out, and if your watch has a heart rate sensor, you'll see your beats per minute too. It also keeps track of how much you've been walking and cycling throughout the week and offers gentle reminders to get going toward your goal if you haven't met your mark. Plus, it will congratulate you when you succeed. The new Google Fit is also a lot better suited to indoor workouts as well. Simply say you're on a treadmill or a stationary bike and it'll track your workout accordingly. Another great feature for strength training fans is that it can also now count reps when you're weight lifting and coach you through push-ups and sit-ups. "The watch actually recognizes that you're doing it," Singleton says. "So there's no cheating." There's also a special treat if your Android watch has LTE. With Wear 2.0, you'll finally be able to stream music to the watch without having to download the songs first. The default option would be with Google Play Music, but Spotify should be compatible soon as well. You'll probably want to use Bluetooth headphones to listen to your tunes, unless you want to blast your playlist to the world around you as you're running. Oh, and say you'd like a refreshing drink after you're done with that run. Well, if you happen to be close to an establishment that accepts Android Pay, you're in luck. That's because Android Pay is finally coming to Wear 2.0. So if your watch happens to support NFC, you can just tap it to the reader to pay for that bottle of water. Last but certainly not least, Wear 2.0 has a completely reimagined app store model. Before, the only way to load apps onto the watch was via a companion app. Not anymore. Now you can browse the Play Store right on the watch and even download certain apps directly, without the need for a corresponding phone app. This is especially useful if you have an iPhone: You'll finally be able to download and use third-party apps regardless of what phone you have. Of course, not all apps can be operated as standalone -- some will still require an Android phone for full functionality. But if you are an iPhone user, you won't see them in the Play Store anyway; only compatible apps will show up on the watch. On the whole, Android Wear 2.0 is a welcome improvement. It not only looks better but also is much easier to use than before. What used to take several taps and swipes now takes one or two. The new messaging and fitness features are welcome as well. But it's the introduction of Google Assistant and the standalone app store that takes Wear 2.0 from good to great. It makes Android Wear not only much less dependent on the phone but also much more compatible with iOS -- making it the toughest contender against the Apple Watch yet.

Android Wear 2.0 was originally announced last May, groomed for launch last fall and then delayed until, well, now. Since that first announcement was made at Google I/O last year, we've seen plenty of new Android Wear watches hit store shelves, but it was hard to get worked up over version 1.whatever when something better, faster and more functional was oh so close. Now the wait is over. As rumored, Google and LG have teamed up on a pair of smartwatches to usher in a new Android Wear 2.0 era. You can find our review of the more basic LG Watch Style here, but with its bigger battery, larger screen and extra niceties, the $349 LG Watch Sport now seems like the Android Wear smartwatch to beat. Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key LG Watch Sport 78 Pros Android Wear 2.0 is a big improvement Mostly excellent performance Rotating crown button works well IP68 water resistance Cons Thick, sometimes cumbersome design Battery life could be better Android Wear feels inconsistent in places Summary LG’s Watch Sport is the more impressive of the two smartwatches launching with Android Wear 2.0, and for the most part it’s a very respectable showing. Beyond the seriously snappy performance, the big Android Wear update brings a load of design tweaks and new features that the platform has needed for a long time. While not perfect, the software helps soften some of the watch’s shortcomings: the body will be too chunky for some, and we wish the battery lasted much longer. Still, the screen works well, the new rotating crown is generally very handy and there’s very little lag to be found. If you can look past those issues, there’s plenty to like about the package overall… though it probably won’t be long before another company crafts another Wear 2.0 that outshines this one. Hardware Gallery: LG Watch Sport review | 22 Photos 22 +18 When I think of sporty smartwatches, I think of bright colors, chunky bodies and outdoorsy looks. The LG Watch Sport, the company's first crack at a fitness-friendly wearable, avoids most of those design tropes. There's nothing particularly rugged about its clean lines and stainless steel, though the watch is nonetheless IP68 water- and-dust resistant. (I've been wearing it in the shower for nearly a week; no disasters so far.) In fact, I'd go as far as to say the Sport would look as good nestled under a suit sleeve as it would on the trails. The two available finishes -- gray and dark blue -- are similarly subdued. When taken in tandem, these design elements make for a smartwatch that's handsome -- in an inoffensive, dull sort of way. There's no getting around it, though: The Watch Sport is one chunky wrist computer. The problem doesn't lie in the screen, a perfectly adequate 1.38-inch round P-OLED panel running at 480 x 480. No, the issue lies mostly with the body. At 14.2mm thick, the Watch Sport is one of the thicker Android Wear pieces out there -- only slightly thinner than overtly rugged devices like Casio's smartwatches and the Nixon Mission. It doesn't help that the polyurethane bands are wide and nonremovable. Google says some of the watch's sensors extend into the band, which explains why those straps aren't going anywhere. They're comfortable enough (even though the plastic bit that holds the tail end of the strap in place moves around a lot), but they angle away from the watch's body in a way that could be uncomfortable for big-wristed people. You might expect the standard-bearer of a dramatically upgraded operating system to pack some impressive, fresh-off-the-line components. Well, not quite. On one hand, there's a fairly common 1.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset inside the Sport, paired with 4GB of storage. On the other hand, you get a whopping 768MB of memory. That chip has definitely been around, but we're looking at the most RAM ever in an Android Wear watch -- definitely handy for keeping everything running smoothly. Then comes the laundry list of radios and sensors seen in other high-end smartwatches. In addition to Bluetooth and WiFi, there's GPS, a heart-rate sensor, an LTE radio and nano-SIM slot, NFC for Android Pay transactions, an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, and ambient light sensor. Phew. No wonder this thing feels so chunky. New to the Android Wear formula is a rotating crown button, similar to what you'll find on Apple Watches. The comparison to Apple is impossible to avoid, but I actually prefer LG's approach; there's just the right amount of friction as you turn the crown, and it juts further out of the watch's body so that it's easier to spin with two fingers. I'm still convinced the spinning bezel from Samsung's Gear S3 Frontier is the most elegant interface you'll find on a smartwatch, but the combination of a big, touchable screen here and a rotating crown for more-precise control gets pretty close. Having two interface mechanisms that essentially do the same thing can get tricky, though, as I'll explain in a moment. Anyway, the crown is flanked by two quick-launch buttons that fire up Google Fit and Android Pay by default. I'm still not sold on the look, but unless you're really into thin watches, the Watch Sport packs more bang for your buck. Android Wear 2.0 Gallery: Android Wear 2.0 screenshots | 21 Photos 21 +17 Love the design or hate it, the LG Sport is ultimately a vessel for a new version of Android Wear. If I were writing this six months ago, that would've meant a wearable with a smattering of new features that, while pretty nifty, didn't do much to move the platform forward. Not anymore. During the week I've been testing the Watch Sport, there's one thought I've kept coming back to: Android Wear is all grown up. More importantly, performance is mostly smooth now. Obviously, the robust hardware helps keep things running nicely, but Android Wear has never felt this fast or flexible, even on watches with basically the same components. Take the apps situation, for instance. Developers have achieved some impressive feats on our wrist-screens, and now it's easier to download and manage apps on the watch independently from a phone. The update packs the ability to download certain apps directly to Wear 2.0 watches over a WiFi or LTE connection. It's quick and works well, and now there are plenty of apps that work well right on the wrist. These past few days, Foursquare has made for a surprisingly able wrist app on day trips to New York City. The app Bring added a handy shopping list I could tap when I remembered to grab the eggs. More crucial to me is that we can now add complications from third-party apps to watch faces. It's been a lifesaver. Consider the weather: Right out of the box, there isn't a way to add a "current temperature" complication to the Sport's six preloaded watch faces. Sure, there's a standalone weather app, but who has the time to open the app launcher and scroll down to the Ws? With the 2.0 update in place, downloading the Weather Channel's complications onto the watch (but not the phone) is dead simple. The Watch Sport is also one of the first wearables to come with Google's Assistant baked in, and most of the time it was an impressive performer. I spent most of the past week asking it to text my friends and answer mundane, random questions I couldn't be bothered to grab a phone for. Think "how many cups in a quart?" or "how old is Vladimir Putin?" Alas, though, my home isn't terribly smart, so I couldn't test how the Watch Sport does at managing lights and firing up connected coffee makers. In any case, my only real disappointment is how long it sometimes takes for the assistant to respond to my questions. The longest delay I've ever seen was 10 to 15 seconds when connected to a phone via Bluetooth; it was typically faster at returning results over WiFi or LTE. Then there are the little things. The watch displays the time even while it's booting up, so there's never a moment -- short of the watch being dead -- when you can't tell what time it is. Quick settings like screen brightness, volume, Do Not Disturb and Airplane Mode are all located in one menu when you swipe down from the home screen, unlike the multiple pages of options in older Android Wear versions. Notifications are color-coded based on the app, and the Google Inbox-style smart replies to messages have been mostly spot-on. As a whole, the Android Wear 2.0 package is impressively well-rounded. My list of gripes is much shorter by comparison. While I think the new design is a big improvement, longtime Android Wear fans will need some time to get reacquainted. It's mostly minor stuff, such as swiping to change watch faces instead of long-pressing. I also wish Google had applied some of these new interaction rules more consistently. Most of the time you have to swipe from left to right on the screen to go back one level, but that doesn't work from the app list. Instead, you're supposed to hit the crown button. Speaking of, the crown could use more consistency too. In some situations, you can either swipe on the screen or spin the crown to scroll up and down. In others, you're forced to use one or the other. The only way to know is to keep an eye on what kind of indicators appear on-screen; if you get a scroll bar that hugs the screen's round edge, you can swipe or spin. For scrolling through things like watch-face complications, though, your only choice is to swipe. Why? I have no idea. To its credit, Google has taken note of the issue and has said it will address this in a future update, but it's unclear when. In use I might not love the Watch Sport's exterior design, but LG has otherwise nailed the basics. The display is crisp and decently bright even under harsh sunlight, though the always-on display mode is easily overpowered by bright days. Day-to-day performance, as I've noted, is generally excellent. Even the new fitness functionality, which can track indoor workouts such as using the elliptical and doing squats, is more precise than I expected. It's a bummer that the automatic activity recognition doesn't work the way Google originally said it would. Early on, the plan was for Android Wear to interpret certain movements as exercise so you'd get the caloric credit for a workout without having to touch the watch. That didn't pan out, as a Google spokesperson explained to Engadget: "After internally testing the auto-start feature as originally envisioned, we concluded that it wasn't the best user experience for many situations (e.g., when you're running to catch the bus)." Fair enough, since the feature still exists for strength training exercises, but here's hoping Google figures it out later. In general, though, the new Android Wear is mostly excellent and runs like a charm on LG's hardware. Still, let's not forget all the extras that the Sport brings to the wrist. I don't know that talking into your wrist has become completely socially acceptable, but at least the Watch Sport doubles as a decent phone. It's worth noting LG isn't new to this; the second-edition Watch Urbane with LTE was the first Android Wear timepiece with a built-in mobile radio for data and calls. And now the Sport's improved software makes it much easier to use. Sure, you can launch the Phone app and scroll through all of your contacts, but asking Google's Assistant to connect me to someone usually seemed more accurate than relying on the voice commands of old. Audio quality is nothing to write home about, though. Max volume isn't all that loud, but I could still hear most conversations pretty clearly on bustling New York streets. Using the GPS can take a while if you're using the watch as a standalone device, but performance improves quickly when the Sport is connected to your phone. Once that's finished, you can load an app such as Google Maps -- which isn't installed on the watch by default, strangely -- to get to your next destination. Getting Android Pay set up before the watch's official launch was sort of a pain, but once that initial setup was complete, I had no problem using the Sport to make some purchases at my local drug store. All of these extras require a powerful battery, though, and the 430mAh cell in the Sport doesn't seem like enough. Yes, that's a bigger battery than we usually see in Android Wear watches, but this updated software seems to be pushing the hardware much more than before. With an active Bluetooth connection to a phone, auto brightness and the always-on display enabled, the Watch Sport usually stuck around for about 13 hours before dying. While that's technically enough juice to get me through a full day of work, I always had to make a beeline for a power outlet once I got home. If you really want to see the battery meter plummet, use an LTE connection to download some apps or load up the watch face that updates its background image based on your location. I think a bigger battery would do more for the watch's user experience than a persistent network connection, but it's ultimately a matter of preference. The competition Not everyone needs every bell and whistle the LG Watch Sport offers, which is why the more basic LG Watch Style exists. It will launch alongside the Sport as one of the first Android Wear 2.0 watches on the market, which means the Style packs all of Google's helpful tweaks and a similar rotating crown button for precise control over apps and notifications. The Style also uses the same Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset as the Sport (albeit with less RAM), and the performance there feels similarly smooth. It costs $100 less than the Sport too, though you'll lose the LTE, NFC, GPS and heart rate sensor along the way. My colleague Cherlynn isn't a fan, but it's worth a look at least. Then you have options like Samsung's Gear S3 Frontier, which features many of the same Watch Sport tricks in a slimmer body. I dig the Frontier's rugged look, but I appreciate its spinning bezel even more. In addition to being fun to use, the bezel also has distinct notches that click into place, making the act of scrolling through notifications and menus feel more satisfying. It costs $349 like the Watch Sport, but choosing the Frontier means you're working with Tizen and its limited selection of useful apps. If you're looking for a smartwatch for your iPhone, meanwhile, the Watch Sport technically does the job. Still, we've experienced a handful of issues with getting standalone apps and notifications to work properly, to the point where we almost don't recommend trying. It's possible this is a symptom of non-final software (we've asked Google for comment), but don't expect the Watch Sport to be much more than a second-class citizen as far as your iPhone is concerned. You're better off with an Apple Watch, in that case. One final note: If you're in the market for a smartwatch, do yourself a favor and ignore every Android Wear 1.0 wearable out there. Their time has come and gone. Even if the LG Watch Sport falls short of perfection, it's just one of many options that will soon be available, and the software improvements are notable enough that there's no reason to look back. Wrap-up It's rare that I find myself enjoying a device's software more than its hardware, but here I am. Don't get me wrong, not much about the Watch Sport as a package of parts is definitively bad. If you don't mind the lackluster battery and thick body, it's a perfectly fast, perfectly adequate smartwatch. It's just that Android Wear 2.0 -- even with its flaws -- is such a marked improvement over earlier versions that it can't help but steal the show. While I don't agree with every one of LG's design choices, the Watch Sport's greatest strength is how easily its technological trappings fade into the background, giving Google's software the power and space to fully shine. In that way, the Watch Sport feels almost Nexus-like in its ambitions and execution. Ultimately, LG has put together a decidedly decent smartwatch, but I can't wait to see where Android Wear 2.0 pops up next.

Google is debuting its new wearable OS on a pair of LG-made devices: the Watch Style and Watch Sport. The Style is a $249 smartwatch that bundles Android Wear 2.0 and a new dial in a petite, simple frame. That all sounds promising in theory, but the Watch Style barely meets expectations and relies on that fancy new software to tempt shoppers. Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key LG Watch Style 65 Pros Android Wear 2.0 is faster and easier to use than before Rotating dial makes navigating easier Handy Play Store integration Water resistant Cons Terrible battery life Design isn’t actually stylish New Android Wear actions are inconsistent Summary As one of the two first watches to launch with the long-awaited update to Android Wear, the LG Watch Style is sadly underwhelming. Despite its name, the Style has a bland design and only meets Android Wear 2.0's minimum hardware requirements. On the bright side, Google's new operating system is faster and more intuitive than before. Too bad the Style isn't a great vehicle for that polished new software. Hardware For a watch with the word "style" in its name, the Watch Style is a letdown from a design standpoint. Although I appreciated the thin case and slim 18mm band, I didn't care for the watch's otherwise bland design. The Italian leather strap I received was an unappetizing camel color that reminded me of, well, my flesh. But it is easy enough to swap out for a nicer strap, with the convenient clasp on the underside. LG offers two other colors for the case (black and rose gold) and two additional band colors: black and cream. The watch's 1.2-inch P-OLED display is a size that's becoming increasingly popular on Wear devices, according to Google. So it's baffling, then, that LG decided to surround the petite screen with an almost half-inch-thick ring of dead space. The display and this black circle are enveloped by the Style's matte-silver case, which has a bezel that adds about another half-inch around the face. While the device is still compact overall, it feels like there's too much wasted space overwhelming the design. Gallery: LG Watch Style review | 16 Photos 16 +12 Thankfully, the rest of the case has a clean, minimal aesthetic. There aren't any etchings or bling here (cough, the Huawei Watch Jewel, cough) -- just a dial on the right of the face that you can press or rotate. The Watch Style also lacks a heart rate monitor, which isn't surprising for the price. The underside of the case is a bare plastic disc that feels as cheap as it looks. For the price, though, the Style's IP67 rating for water and dust resistance is a nice touch. It's safe enough to wear in rainy weather (or in the shower, if you want), but I wouldn't recommend getting the leather band wet. Android Wear 2.0 Gallery: Android Wear 2.0 screenshots | 21 Photos 21 +17 We've known about the features coming to Android Wear 2.0 for a while, but seeing it all together on a new watch impresses upon you the fact that this is a whole new operating system. Gone is the slightly cartoonish card-based interface. In its place, we have something cleaner and more refined. One of the biggest updates to the OS is the new scrolling mechanism. The original Android Wear was criticized for being too reliant on swiping to get around. You had to swipe over and over again to get through all the notifications stacked up under the home page, for instance, or swipe twice to the right to unearth OK Google or your contacts. With this new interface, you can scroll through all of your alerts just by dragging your finger down the screen or twisting the dial. This saves a lot of time and is the main reason the new OS feels so much faster and more responsive than before. But Google was slightly inconsistent in integrating this mechanism with its existing gestures, which makes navigating a bit confusing. For example, swiping right from the apps list on the old Wear brought you back to the watch face. Doing that on the Wear 2.0 does nothing; you have to press the dial to go back home from the apps list. Sure, it's easy enough to relearn a few gestures, but in this case, since swiping right doesn't do anything, it would have been more intuitive if Google simply programmed that action to bring you home. I also wish Google had been more thoughtful in some other aspects of the software. Music playback controls still shows up as a notification in the new Wear. It was annoying when I accidentally dismissed the music notification and had to wait till the next song for the alert to appear again. This is a better Android Wear, but it's not without its problems. When paired to an iPhone, the Style has fewer functions than when connected to an Android device. The features you'll miss the most on iOS include the ability to reply to your messages or initiate calls from your wrist -- indeed, some of the most convenient amenities a smartwatch has to offer. You'll also find far fewer apps available in the wearable's onboard app store if you're paired to an iOS device. The Play Store is another addition to Android Wear 2.0 that makes finding apps for your wrist easier. Downloading and installing most applications took less than 30 seconds, which is a reasonable wait time. That said, larger files like games took longer. As I mentioned before, though, iOS users will find a dearth of compatible apps. I only saw a total of about a dozen applications in three categories when paired with an iPhone as opposed to more than a hundred listings across five categories when connected to Android. These standalone apps work even when your watch isn't linked to your phone, which is another benefit of Wear 2.0. The new platform promises better iOS compatibility than its predecessor, but it's still not a viable Apple Watch alternative for iPhone users. In use Regardless of the device you're connected to, the Android Wear's enhancements make for a more useful smartwatch than before. In particular, the improved notifications interface does a good job of keeping you informed without being too distracting. Getting rid of the card-based system from the old Android Wear was a fantastic decision on Google's part. Now when a notification arrives on your watch, a badge for the corresponding app pops up from the bottom of the face and slides back out of sight. In its place is a tiny indicator icon on the home screen to remind you that you have unread alerts, which you can check out either by swiping up or turning the watch dial. A simple twist of the knob can take you all the way to the last alert in an instant. This new input method makes all the difference in the updated OS. Think of it as a cross between the Apple Watch's dial and the Samsung Gear's rotating bezel: It has the intuitive rotating action of Apple's hardware with the functionality of Samsung's twist-to-scroll interface. Google's collaboration with LG on the hardware here also paid off. In particular, the latency between the dial and the software is imperceptible, making for fluid performance. It's mesmerizing to watch the list of apps move up and down without lag as I turn the knob in either direction. It'd be nice if there were notches in the dial, like there are in the Gear S3, to make for more-precise navigation, but that's not a huge issue, especially since the hardware here is so much more compact than Samsung's wearable. As much as I like the new dial, though, I found its placement slightly problematic. Whenever I had to bend my hand backward -- say, when I was pushing against a door or tap -- the back of my hand would press into the knob, triggering the assistant. It's a small gripe, since it's easy enough to dismiss the assistant, but it's something I'd like to see addressed in future devices. Although the Watch Style has a skimpier selection of onboard sensors than its more expensive brother, it still carries a modest few components, such as an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a Bluetooth radio and an ambient light sensor. Its round 360 x 360 display is bright and colorful, and words and graphics (such as the adorable penguin watch face I installed) are easy to see. Together with the refreshed operating system, the Style's 1.1GHz Snapdragon 2100 CPU kept the device running smoothly. I even found the Style to be more responsive than other watches with similar specs, so I credit the new Android Wear for the performance improvements. For instance, dismissing notifications on the old platform resulted in a one- or two-second wait, while it happens instantly with Wear 2.0. I did notice a slight (one-second or so) delay whenever I tried to wake the device, whether by tapping on the screen or lifting my wrist. Plus, anything that required voice recognition, such as talking to the assistant or saying a phrase for the Translate app, took up to about 10 excruciatingly long seconds to register and process. That's a pain but not nearly as frustrating as the Style's battery life. Its 240mAh battery, which is rated to last "all day," barely survives a full workday, much less 24 hours. On a busy day with frequent notifications and a moderate amount of testing, the Style conked out nine hours after being fully recharged. With less-intensive use, the device made it through close to 12 hours, which means you'll still have to plug it back in about twice per day. Compared to the existing smartwatches that typically last about one and a half to two days, the Style's endurance is its biggest drawback. The competition At the moment, there isn't a perfect substitute for the new LG watches. They're the only two Android Wear 2.0 watches on the market right now with the rotating dial, although that will change soon. If you don't mind foregoing the nifty new knob, you'll find a plethora of options. Most other existing Android Wear watches will get the updated OS "in the coming weeks," according to Google, although certain manufacturers are sure to be slower than others. For $20 less, you'll find the ASUS Zenwatch 3, which has a larger screen and a bigger battery. The Zenwatch doesn't run Wear 2.0 yet, though, so if you go that route you'll have to wait before you see that fancy new software. Those who prefer classier-looking watches than the Style should consider the Moto 360 for Women, the Fossil Q Wander or the Q Marshal. All three options are prettier than LG's watch, but they also cost $50 more. Between the two new LG devices, the Sport is the better choice. It does everything the Style does, but it also has a heart rate sensor, supports GPS and Android Pay, and offers built-in LTE so you can make calls from the watch without depending on a companion phone. The Sport is much chunkier than the Style, though, and $100 more expensive, so it's not ideal for folks with smaller wrists or limited budgets. Wrap-up Ultimately, the LG Watch Style feels more like a proof of concept than a smartwatch for consumers. It shows how well Android Wear 2.0 can perform when Google collaborates with a device maker to make sure new hardware input methods are integrated properly into the interface. But almost everything else about the Style, from its bland design to its dismal battery life, is disappointing. Even though its $249 price is relatively affordable, a lower cost would help justify some of this watch's shortfalls. Simply put, the Style is not a good enough watch to showcase the many improvements that Android Wear has made. Fortunately, any number of promising alternatives are sure to arrive this season.

According to information sent to us by Google Canada, the current software release lineup includes the following smartwatches: Asus ZenWatch 2 Asus ZenWatch 3 Casio Smart Outdoor Watch Casio PRO TREK Smart Fossil Q Founder Fossil Q Marshal Fossil Q Wander Huawei Watch LG Watch R LG Watch Urbane and 2nd Edition LTE Michael Kors Access Smartwatches Moto 360 2nd Gen Moto 360 Sport New Balance RunIQ Nixon Mission Polar M600 TAG Heuer Connected Most notable in the list of smartwatches set to receive Android Wear 2.0 is the recently released ZenWatch 3, a smartwatch both Rose Behar and I found very impressive. What’s still unclear is when the new OS will hit these devices and what particular wearables in this list will receive Android Wear 2.0 first. What we do know, however, is that all the above smart watches will be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0 at some point in the future. Interestingly, Google also notes that not all of 2.0’s new features will come to every smartwatch that supports the upgraded operating system because “some functionality requires hardware sensors which are not available on all Android Wear Watches.” We’ve reached out to Google Canada for further clarification regarding the rollout of Android Wear 2.0 and will update this story when we know more.

So that feature will not be found on older smart watches that do not have an adjustable digital crown. Greg Too bad for my Sony Smartwatch 3. Time for a new watch I guess.

Wondering how you hit 90 percent of your data just five days into your bill cycle? MobileSyrup has you covered. We’ve created a handy guide on how to identify and stop data drains on Android. After all, Canadians already pay some of the highest prices for wireless services in the world — no need for them to get any higher. Additionally, iOS users can expect to see a data savings guide for iPhones and iPads debut on the site in the near future. Identify data hogs An important first step in tackling data overages is figuring out which apps are using the most of your data. Android users can head to ‘Data Usage’ in settings and check out the top offending apps ranked in order, or try out a third-party app like Onavo Count. Once you’ve pinpointed the app you need to work on, you can get to work refining data consumption using many of the other tips from this tutorial. Once you’ve pinpointed the app you need to work on, you can get to work refining data consumption using many of the other tips from this tutorial. Set social apps to stop autoplaying videos Autoplay video on various social media platforms and websites can contribute to significant unintentional data usage. Facebook users can limit this with an account setting (accessible via browser or app). The setting, housed under ‘Video,’ allows for controls over when or if videos are ever allowed to autoplay. There is a similar setting available for Twitter users under ‘Settings’ and then ‘Video autoplay.’ The setting, housed under ‘Video,’ allows for controls over when or if videos are ever allowed to autoplay. There is a similar setting available for Twitter users under ‘Settings’  and then ‘Video autoplay.’ Use Pocket to store web pages Cut down on your mobile browsing while out and about by using Pocket, available for both iOS and Android. Pocket allows you to download articles, videos and other content over Wi-Fi and save it for later on your mobile device. This tip requires a little forethought, but it’s worth it for heavy mobile readers. Use offline features for music or video streaming Some of the routine offenders that consume the most data, streaming apps, can be managed by preloading content over a Wi-Fi connection. For Spotify, users can go to ‘Songs’ if they want to save all tunes in their library for offline listening, or go to the playlist, artist or album and toggle ‘Download’ on. Apple Music also offers an offline listening mode for Android users. As for video streaming, Netflix now has an offline viewing mode for Android and iOS. Check out our how-to on using the new feature here. YouTube, unfortunately, does not offer an offline mode in Canada, but in its general settings users can limit mobile data usage by making sure HD video streams only on Wi-Fi and turning off autoplay. Use Chrome Data Saver This handy feature for the Chrome app on Android funnels most of your web traffic through Google servers, compressing it before it is downloaded to your device. On a slow connection, the feature also simplifies the page to make it load faster, though an option is available to show the original page. Data Saver won’t work, however, on ‘https://’ pages or if you’re browsing in Incognito mode. Google further cautions that some websites might have trouble finding your location, some images might be fuzzy, you might not be able to sign in to your mobile carrier’s site and websites that are restricted to certain groups like internal company sites might not work. If none of these things sound like deal breakers (and if you’re not using a proxy server that could interfere with Data Saver) you can turn on the feature by tapping ‘More’ (the three dots) in the Chrome app then heading to ‘Settings.’ Under ‘Advanced,’ select ‘Data Saver,’ and switch it on. Chrome Data Saver is currently unavailable for iOS, though Google say that if Apple makes changes to ‘WKWebView’ to allow the feature, it will add Data Saver back in. Disable unnecessary sync options A small but simple way to save some ‘KBs’ is by restricting the amount of things syncing in the background. Android users can head to ‘Accounts’ under settings, then select syncing options per app. Google accounts, for instance, come along with a hefty amount of syncing options that are left on by default. Many users will find that options like ‘Drive’ or ‘Calendar’ can comfortably by turned off.

Many users will find that options like ‘Drive’ or ‘Calendar’ can comfortably by turned off. Restrict background data Android allows its users to disable background data on cellular networks for any app — allowing for a reduced drain from some of the most data-hungry apps on your list. To activate, simply navigate to ‘Data Usage’ in settings, select the app and swipe on the toggle for ‘Restrict background data.’ Before you accept, you’ll receive a caution that it may cause an app that depends on background data to stop working when only cellular networks are available.

Restrict app updates and podcast downloads to Wi-Fi only A potential data hog could be automatic updates for apps and other content downloads like podcasts. Make sure you are set to auto-update over Wi-Fi only in the Google Play Store by opening the store, tapping the ‘More’ menu, going to ‘Settings’ and setting ‘Auto-update apps’ to either ‘over Wi-Fi only’ or ‘Do not auto-update apps.’ Your podcast app will also have auto-download settings. In the most popular Android podcast app, CastBox, you can head to ‘Settings’ and then ‘Download’ to specify your preferences. Your podcast app will also have auto-download settings.

Save maps for offline use One of the essential uses of a smartphone — navigation — has generally required data for operation, but with the advent of offline mode in Google Maps that is becoming less of a necessity. In Google Maps, users can download maps for offline use, freeing up yet more valuable data but taking up a significant portion of internal storage space. To download a map enter Google Maps, hit the ‘Menu’ button in the search bar, select ‘Offline areas’ and either choose a preset map, like ‘Home’ or select your own area to download. The areas will update automatically over Wi-Fi, but if the app can’t reach Wi-Fi in 30 days, the offline areas will expire.

The areas will update automatically over Wi-Fi, but if the app can’t reach Wi-Fi in 30 days, the offline areas will expire. Download Opera Max Opera Max is a handy downloadable app from the well-known browser company that compresses content before it reaches your phone, promising a savings of up to 50 percent of data across apps. The tool is much like Chrome Data Saver except for the fact that it works more broadly, bringing compression not just to the browser, but across all apps and games. It also promises an extra layer of encryption for your data and to halt the unknowing transmission of private information with third-party tracking services. It’s free, but requires the user to reactivate service every 12 hours. To do away with this distraction, users can choose to activate the ‘VIP’ mode, which provides unlimited time in return for an ad appearing on your lock screen when charging.

Start with getting a better plan (which is tough here, but possible). However, if you think that paying $50 for plan w/1Gb data + $10-15 for extra Gb is more easy, then yes, please read above and waste your time on so called ‘savings’. Alex when buying, buy during boxing week, or when u get a REALLY good deal. you save on cost of the phone, in this case, good phones, and you usually find great deals. Not all carriers give great deals, thus sometimes, if you are already on rogers, you can’t go to telus’s great deal, etc. Carlos Dudas Rogers now has $50 per GB overage rates, might be worth looking into getting one of the older plans that still have the $10 per GB option. heynow00 Great article, should be included with all Android purchases! Alex they should… but they just make soooo much money by not doing that. Shogun The biggest hog of data is streaming. Web browsing takes up very little data overall so if you’re getting tons of overage charges may be time to consider downloading on wifi in advance what you want to watch or listen to. MoYeung “Google accounts, for instance, come along with a hefty amount of syncing options that are left on by default.

Ulfredsson The Vanquisher Also… should be mentioned… if you lose your phone, you should report it lost. I read that CBC article about the dummy who didn’t and then was shocked he had a $24000 bill. Andrew Opera Max can save a ton of data, I highly recommend it. Tim Adblockers save a ton of data as well. I’ve got AdGuard installed on my Moto Z Play and it shows that I’ve saved 12.48GB. AG Premium also allows for ad-blocking within apps as well as the internet browser.

Similar to Google’s now defunct Nexus smartphone line and its current Pixel devices, the smartwatches are set to be the first wearables to run Android Wear 2.0, the latest version of the tech giant’s wearable operating system. Other previously released Android Wear smartwatches will also receive 2.0, though specific release dates have not been revealed yet by Google or its manufacturer partners. Google describes the LG Watch Style as a “thin, light [and] beautiful” smartwatch that’s comfortable to wear. The device is set to be available in three designs and finishes, including silver, rose gold and titanium. The smartwatch’s strap features what Google calls a simple “snap-and-swap” system and comes with either a leather or silicone band. The Style’s “rotating button,” which sounds and look very similar to the Apple Watch’s Digital Crown, allows users to easily scroll through the operating system’s various displays, including Wear 2.0’s new on-watch app launcher and Google Assistant. The LG Watch Sport on the other hand, is set to be available in titanium and dark blue variants, and comes equipped with a elastomer strap. The smartwatch also features NFC for digital payments, though Android Pay still has not launched in Canada. The watch also includes built-in GPS, similar to Samsung’s Gear S3, as well as a heart rate sensor and independent cellular connectivity, a feature supported by Wear 2.0. LG Watch Style specs Software: Android Wear 2.0 Display: 1.2-inch 360×360 P-OLED Auto-brightness Gorilla Glass 3 Processor: Snapdragon Wear 2100 1.1GHz Memory: 512MB Storage: 4GB Battery: 240 mAh Wireless charging Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Resistance: IP67 Straps: Italian genuine leather User-replaceable 18 mm Dimensions: 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79 mm Colors: Silver, Titanium, Rose Gold Price $249 USD (approximately $330 CAD) LG Watch Sport specs Software: Android Wear 2.0 Display: 1.38-inch 480 x 480 pixel P-OLED Auto-brightness Gorilla Glass 3 Processor Snapdragon Wear 2100 1.1GHz Memory: 768MB Storage: 4GB Battery: 430 mAh Wireless charging Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC Accelerometer: gyroscope, barometer PPG: heart rate sensor Resistance: IP68 Straps: TPU Non-removable Dimensions: 45.4 x 51.21 x 14.2 mm Colors: Titanium, Dark Blue (Google Store only) Price: $349 (approximately $459 CAD) The Sport also features a dedicated button for Google Fit, as well as a rotating power button that seems very similar to the LG Watch Style’s Digital Crown-like knob. Both watches will be available in the U.S. on February 10th, but a specific Canadian release date has not yet been revealed. We can, however, confirm that both watches are coming to Canada, as well as Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the UAE and the U.K. in “the coming weeks,” according to Google.

So all other cards are currently not supported. Patrick O’Rourke My understanding is that’s been blocked as well, though it did work for a few days. purdy44 I’m hoping Android Pay comes to Canada soon.

(Details of the event at Texas Law School can be found here—I highly recommend the event to anyone interested in cybersecurity and the laws of war.)  The Tallinn Manual is a remarkable document, partly because of the breadth of issues that it covers and partly because the cyber terrain shifts like quicksand. I focus here only on one small aspect of the manual—its application of the law of state sovereignty. As the Manual notes, international law typically distinguishes jurisdiction to prescribe, adjudicate, and enforce the law.  Jurisdiction to enforce and adjudicate are usually limited to what the state can actually get its hands around—including foreign assets and persons within the state’s reach. Jurisdiction to prescribe is believed to be broader, including legislative steps to protect the state’s own citizens at home or abroad, regulate conduct on the state’s soil, prevent attacks against the state, and so on.  Given these fairly fundamental distinctions, it might seem sensible enough for the Tallinn Manual 2.0 to begin with a survey of the law of jurisdiction.  After all, one cannot talk about cybersecurity for very long before hearing all sorts of anxiety about sovereignty—anxiety about one state’s ability to breach the territorial border of another through the civilian internet, questions of who constitutes a state actor, and so on.  But when it comes to the laws of cyberwarfare, very little actually turns on the most basic jurisdictional distinctions. Imagine, for example, what happens if a state alleges that its citizen is the victim of a cyber attack abroad.  What follows from that fact—that the state has the jurisdiction over a response? If there is actual harm to the victim, few will question the state’s legitimate interest in protecting its citizens; the relevant questions will turn on attributing the attack and delimiting the state’s response. Or suppose a state is upset about a cyber campaign that has domestic territorial effects.  Does the state’s claim that its “sovereignty was violated” change their legal or military response?  It is simply not clear what follows from this assertion.  Like the first edition, the second edition of the Manual notes, in its very first rule, that: “A State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory.”  This is both a deeply obvious point and one that, at some level, is unlikely to be true.  Of course a state has the authority—and would take it even if it did not have it—to exercise control over what it can control, namely the things within its territorial reach (including servers and companies on its soil). But what does it mean to say that a state may exercise control over cyber “activity” within its territory?  And how far does this rule extend?  For example, when the European Court of Justice says that Google must honor a right to be forgotten, and remove links to certain web results, does the Tallinn Manual’s rule endorse the court’s ruling because Google engaged in cyber “activity” in Spain? If so, does the Manual’s rule endorse enforcing the court’s order within Spain, all of Europe, or worldwide?  For European domains—Google.de, Google.es, Google.fr—or Google.com?  Even if the scope of the word “activity” were not vague, it merely begs the question: what does this Rule suggest that Spain can do in order to force Google to comply with its rules?  As Google’s ongoing legal battles over the right to be forgotten indicate—battles, by the way, fought in Spain, France, and elsewhere—this is no easy problem. The revised and expanded edition of the Manual, in other words, still begins with distinctions that matter to basic conflict of laws problems, but it is not clear to me how much work they do in armed conflicts. For example, one passage notes: “In light of the variety of jurisdictional bases in international law, two or more States often enjoy jurisdiction over the same person or object in respect to the same event.”  This statement does not begin to describe the half of it.  Of course, states will have competing claims over aspects of cyber activity.  If those claims are legal claims, then one hopes they are resolved in a court and according to conflict of laws principles—not with armed conflict. So why begin a (second) manual on the law of cyberwarfare with bland assertions about state sovereignty that do not actually do much work in the arena of cyberwar?  My guess is that this section of the Manual was a political bone to give to states that feel a loss of sovereign control over this whole internet thing. “Sovereignty” in this context is used by state actors to signal their deep anxiety about cyberspace. Whether that is an actual loss of sovereignty—and whether sovereignty is a helpful legal concept in this space—is very much yet to be seen. So while the Manual is a hugely important contribution, it begins with something of a red herring.  The real action is in the manual’s treatment of the laws of war to this new domain—questions that will have profound consequences and which are much harder to answer than noting that states have an interest in and authority over internet infrastructure on their soil.

While Wear 2.0 is launching with the recently revealed LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport, the new version of the wearable operating system is also coming to a number of previously released smartwatches in the coming months. The latest version of Google’s wearable operating system brings a number of improvements to its user interface, including Google Assistant, support for cellular connectivity and additional customization, all features users have been requesting since the launch of Android Wear back in March 2014. While Wear 2.0 adds new features to the operating system, it’s unclear if this functionality will be enough to revitalize the relatively stagnant smartwatch industry. Below are some of Wear 2.0’s more interesting features: 1. Personalized watch faces One of Android Wear 2.0’s often-discussed new features includes the ability to customize watch faces to a greater degree, an issue many users cited as a significant problem with the first version of Android Wear. Apps can be now launched directly from a watch face, including requesting an Uber, starting a workout or quickly sending a message. Similar to functionality Apple added to the Apple Watch with WatchOS 3, as well as the first version of Pebble’s operating system, quick swipes can now switch between various customized watch faces. 2. New Google Fit features A new version of Google Fit now comes pre-installed on “most” smartwatches that support Android Wear 2.0. Google says the app now lets users track their pace, distance, calories burned and their heart rate, while walking, running or cycling. Weight-lifting reps, as well as push-ups, sit-ups and squats, can also be measured. Google Fit also now supports cellular-connected Android Wear watches (like the recently announced LG Sport), allowing wearers to stay in touch with calls and messages, or streaming music from Google Play Music, with out the need to be connected to a smartwatch. While the utility of a cellular-connect smartwatch is likely limited, the ability to leave your phone at home, but still perform basic tasks, could be a big draw for some people still indifferent about wearable fitness devices. 3. On-watch Play Store In order for a smartwatch to work completely independently from a smartphone, it needs to have access to an on-device app store. With Android Wear 2.0, this is exactly what Google is adding to its wearable operating system. Users will now be able to search for Wear apps and download them directly via a new on-watch version of the Google Play Store. Furthermore, if the watch has a cellular connection, it’s now possible to make calls directly from the smartwatch. Google also says that regardless of whether users connect a Wear 2.0 watch to an Android phone or iPhone, apps like AccuWeather, Android Pay (which still isn’t available in Canada), Bring!, Foursquare, Google Fit, Google Messenger, Google Play Music, Lifesum, RunKeeper and many more, will operate completely independently of the smartwatch as long as Wi-Fi or cellular connectivity is available. 4. New ways to respond to messages Android Wear 2.0 also adds new ways to respond to messages from Android Wear devices. When users receive a message, they can now expand the message and send a response by dictating, typing (with a full keyboard), handwriting or by drawing an emoji. At launch, Google says this functionality is supported by apps like Facebook Messenger, Google Messenger, Hangouts and WhatsApp. Wear 2.0 also features “Smart Reply,” a simple way to respond to messages with predetermined replies. 5. Google Assistant comes to Wear 2.0 What amounts to what is Android Wear 2.0’s most exciting feature, Google Assistant, the Mountain View, California-based tech giant’s typically excellent contextual digital assistant, is coming to the wearable operating system. With Wear 2.0, Google Assistant is also present on the wearer’s wrist and is easy to access. The digital assistant gives users instant access to setting reminders, the ability to check the weather and even creating a simple shopping list. In order to access Google Assistant in Android Wear 2.0, users need to hold down on the power button and say “Ok Google,” similar to launching the feature on the Pixel. Google says Assistant is first launching in English and German, though mentions the digital assistant will be available in other languages in the coming months. It’s unclear if the company plans to release a French-language version of Google Assistant for wearable devices.

Ron Amadeo - Feb 8, 2017 5:00 pm UTC reader comments 112 Share this story The LG Watch Sport. There's a speaker on the side, but don't expect it to get used for much. On the other side are big, chunky buttons. The back is plastic, and you'll find the usual heart rate sensor here. It also comes with a little pin wrench. One of those bottom holes is the microphone. You can put the wrench on the back of the watch, twist, and it will come off. With the back off, you can put in an SIM card. The Watch Sport on the charger. It looks just like the Moto 360 charger—it's a wirelessly charging watch stand. USB Type C on the back. The face isn't much bigger than the Moto 360 2015 (left) and the Huawei Watch (right). The Watch Sport is a lot thicker, though. Check out the box, which fits right in with the Google Home and Pixel boxes. SPECS AT A GLANCE: LG WATCH SPORT SCREEN 480×480 1.38-inch (348 PPI) P-OLED OS Android Wear 2.0 (7.1.1-based) CPU 1.1GHz Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 (Four Cortex A7 cores) RAM 768MB GPU Adreno 304 STORAGE 4GB NETWORKING 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC SIZE 45.4 x 51.21 x 15.5 mm (1.79 x 2.02 x 0.61 in) BATTERY 430 mAh STARTING PRICE $349 (Euro pricing TBC, but probably ~£350/€400) OTHER PERKS Speaker, IP68 dust and water resistance, PPG heart rate monitor, After more than two-and-a-half years on the market and many minor updates, Google's Android Wear platform is finally getting its first major overhaul: Android Wear 2.0. To celebrate, Google and LG have teamed up to create a pair of smartwatches, the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, as the flagship Android Wear 2.0 devices. The Style is a $250 smartwatch that aims to be as thin as possible (so much so that it doesn't even have a heart rate sensor) but the bigger, more expensive LG Watch Sport is the more interesting of the two. The $350 Sport packs almost every radio you'd find in a smartphone—LTE, NFC, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. LTE gives it independent access to the Internet, so messages and notifications arrive no matter where you are. NFC makes this the first watch to support Android Pay, so you can walk into a store without a smartphone or wallet, tap on the terminal, and be on your way. GPS means you can leave the house and still have access to Google Maps and run tracking, and with a pair of Bluetooth headphones, you can bring some music along on your jog. There's a ton of new software, too. Android Wear 2.0 has seen a top-to-bottom overhaul with an all-new UI and a new app development strategy that starts with an on-watch Google Play app store. It has the Google Assistant, a revamp of Google Fit, and even a tiny QWERTY keyboard that works surprisingly well. When paired with Wear 2.0, the Watch Sport represents a total rethink of Google's smartwatch strategy—it doesn't really need your smartphone any more. The hardware The Watch Sport is LG branded, but Google was heavily involved in the development of the device. According to The Verge, Android Wear Product Manager Jeff Chang "likened the partnership to Google’s Nexus smartphone program in terms of collaboration and goals." This Google/LG partnership is definitely visible on the box—in addition to being a perfect match for Google's Pixel and Google Home boxes, the box proudly proclaims, "Designed with our friends at Google." Enlarge / The Watch Sport band doesn't bend where you would expect it to. The first inch of the band on both sides is rigid, allowing LG to pack the radio antennas in there. (In this picture, you can also see how much bigger it is than a 2nd gen 42mm Moto 360.) Ron Amadeo For a display, the Watch Sport has a 1.38-inch 480x480 (348 PPI) circular P-OLED display covered with Gorilla Glass 3. Inside is a quad-core 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2100 with 768MB of RAM, 4GB of storage, and a 430mAh battery. The design does not seem far off from LG's previous LTE-enabled smartwatch, the troubled LG Watch Urbane 2. It's a big, bulky sport watch with a steel body and a permanently affixed rubbery-plastic watch band. The band doesn't come off, because it actually contains the antennas for LTE, Wi-Fi, and the other radios. It's difficult to make all these radios work in a steel case, so stuffing them into a non-metal band is an easy solution. As a result of the embedded antennas, the band isn't entirely flexible—the first inch of the band on each side is rigid. There is no actual hinge connecting the band to the watch, and the rigid band only starts flexing after the antenna section. It might not fit as snugly on smaller wrists as you would expect. I'm still not sure if I should really call the LG Sport Watch "too big" or "ugly." It says "Sport Watch" right in the name, and it doesn't look much bigger or uglier than the other "sport" watches out there. The 45mm face and 15.5mm thickness fits right in with the rugged sport watches from Casio or Timex, and the LG Sport Watch is downright tiny compared to many of the G-Shock watches out there. This device doesn't aim for the "classic" or "luxury" look of the Apple Watch, Moto 360, and Huawei Watch. It's not my style—I prefer the classic look—but this is apparently someone's style. It's a shame that we're stuck with only this look, since the watch band isn't removable. Enlarge / The top and bottom buttons can be assigned to apps, while the crown is used for "Home" and scrolling. Ron Amadeo Android Wear 2.0 has rejiggered the Wear control scheme a bit, and on the Watch Sport you'll find a whopping three side buttons. The top and bottom buttons have configurable actions—on the home screen, they can be set up to launch an app, and once you're inside an app, developers can program the buttons to perform an app-specific action. Since the side buttons are a fairly new development in the Android Wear world, don't expect many apps to actually use them. Apple Watch users will feel right at home with the center crown button. It spins and has a "press in" function. Spinning it will scroll whatever list you're in, while pressing the crown will load the home screen, then the app list. Apple has already set the standard here and we're probably stuck with it, but I would really prefer the crown act like a regular jog dial. I keep pressing the crown in to select the thing in the center of the screen, but it doesn't work that way. Scrolling with the crown is a joy. In addition to not obstructing the screen, it's fast and more precise than touch scrolling. With one or two hard spins, you can be at the bottom of any list. When you need to be more precise, it's easy to slowly spin the wheel. It's also great for reading longer messages on the tiny screen. You'll find the usual photoplethysmogram (PPG) heart rate sensor on the plastic back of the watch. Unlike most watches, which mount the sensor flush with the back of the watch, LG and Google put the sensor on top of a 1mm bump. These heart rate sensors always work better if the watch has a death grip on your wrist, but apparently this bump helps the sensor make better contact with your skin, giving you a solid reading even with a comfortable strap tightness. The back of the watch is removable. There are three pin holes on the back that form a triangle, and a matching plastic pin wrench comes with the watch. Just line up the wrench on the back of the watch and twist and the back comes off, revealing the nano SIM slot and an alarming amount of internal guts. (I'm pretty sure at this point you could start disconnecting components like the PPG sensor.) With the back off, you'll also notice the rubber seal around the perimeter of the opening, which is good for an IP68 dust and water ingress rating. In the US, the Watch Sport will be sold at AT&T and Verizon stores, both of which are going to charge you an extra monthly fee for the privilege of adding another device to your plan. During testing, the smartwatch worked fine with a data-only Project Fi SIM, which costs zero extra money per month but won't allow you to make phone calls directly. Google says this feature is "not supported," but that's different from "it won't work." The charger looks just like the Moto 360 charger. You get a little stand that the watch can sit in, which wirelessly charges the device and turns it into a desk clock. On the back of the dock, there's a USB-Type C port for power. These "display" chargers are great for a desk-side clock, but sometimes I want to charge up a watch in a bag, and that never works with these gravity-dependent chargers. (My solution? In the past, I've brought some tape.) Page: 1 2 3 4 Next → Ron Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in Android OS and Google products.

Valentina Palladino - Feb 8, 2017 5:00 pm UTC Enlarge Valentina Palladino reader comments 15 Share this story Android Wear 2.0 is officially out, and Google has welcomed the update into the world with two new smartwatches: the LG Sport Watch and the LG Style Watch. While Android Wear now has a bunch of new and improved features, we wanted to take a new look at Google Fit specifically. Shortly after Apple came out with the Health app and HealthKit framework, Google released the Fit as its way of collecting and storing everyday activity data from multiple sources. Android Wear, along with third-party app integrations, allows you to use Google Fit more efficiently by tracking workouts with hardware that should be more accurate than the motion sensors inside your smartphone. Google Fit was updated last year, so I spent some time with LG's Style Watch and Google Fit to see how the fitness app has evolved, how well it interacts with one of the newest Android Wear devices, and if it will really be able to stand up to Apple's and Fitbit's programs going forward. LG Style Watch overview Further ReadingLG Watch Sport review: Google’s bulky watch breaks free from the smartphoneArs' Ron Amadeo spent some time with the $349 LG Sport Watch, and I tested the $249 LG Style Watch. While the Style is certainly more svelte than its counterpart, that slimness contributes to the Style being a less-equipped a fitness device. Unlike the Sport, which has built-in GPS, an optical heart rate monitor, and a barometer, the Style only has an accelerometer and gyroscope inside. That means the $250 device will tell you as much as the $79 Fitbit Flex 2 or $99 Fitbit Alta if fitness is your biggest consideration in a smartwatch purchase. Clearly, Google and LG banked on the Sport being the primary device for fitness enthusiasts, while the Style is geared more to fashion-focused consumers. The companies push the style as the slimmest Android Wear device you can buy, and it is quite slim, measuring just 10.79mm thick. Sense of style is all about personal preference, and for me, the Style has all the personality of a generic watch emoji, making it too bland to be considered truly fashion-forward. Plenty of wearables companies strike a balance between minimalist design and gadgets that are immediately identifiable and recognizable, but Google and LG missed the mark with the Style. Going back to fitness, the LG Style does run Android Wear 2.0, which includes separate Google Fit and Fit Workout apps. Fit is now mostly an informational app, showing your overall fitness goal immediately upon launching the app. Scrolling down the watch's display shows your total step count, total distance traveled, active minutes, and calories burned for the current day as well. In Fit, the bottom third of the circular display becomes a button that gives you quick access to Fit Workout, where you can start recording exercises. The Style supports a decent list of activities: walking, running, biking, treadmill running, stationary biking, aerobics (better known as the "miscellaneous" category), stair climbing, and pushup, sit up, and squat challenges. LG's Style Watch running Android Wear 2.0. Genuine leather band. Button closures attach the band to the case. Google Fit homepage on the watch. Fit Workout's exercise options The Android Wear 2.0 app drawer. The on-watch Play Store app. For the cardio exercises, the Style is on point, with distance calculations and measurements close to the Apple Watch Series 2 in calorie estimates. The "challenge" exercises count every rep you complete accurately, and I appreciate that the app shows you a short instructional video to teach you proper form for push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. Form is important for getting the most out of your workout and reducing the risk of injury, but proper form also ensures that the watch can track every rep you do correctly. I was very disappointed to see the Style doesn't support the weight training category that the Sport does, which automatically recognizes which exercises you're doing while tracking reps. I reached out to Google to confirm which Sport sensors allow the feature. As it turns out, only the accelerometer and gyroscope are needed for that feature, but it's not enabled on the Style because it's considered too "battery-intensive." In the future, Google will consider bringing the feature to other Android Wear devices, but that's a bummer for anyone thinking that they could use all Google Fit has to offer when buying the LG Style. At least Google did right by this feature on the LG Sport: Ron was impressed with the auto-recognition's accuracy in detecting every different weight training move he did. In light of that left-out feature, let's talk about battery life. The Style sports a 240mAh battery, which lasted all day during normal use, including one workout (I did use it with a Galaxy S7 Edge, not an iPhone). After wearing it for 15 hours, it still had about 25 percent battery life left. That's not too bad considering most smartwatches last about a day or two on a single charge. But what was more concerning was the Style's performance in our Android Wear battery test. This sends a Hangouts message to the watch every 15 seconds to keep the CPU at work and wake up the display. On average, the Style lasted 176 minutes in our testing, or just under three hours. Even during general use, I could tell that the watch lost battery life faster on the days that my wrist was vibrating with more smartphone notifications than usual. But perhaps the Style's most disappointing feature is its price. The $249 Style banks on the idea that you mostly want a smartwatch for notifications and communication rather than fitness. The Sport is the better fitness device purely because it has a built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and can auto-recognize exercises. However, the Style remains overpriced for what it offers. There are much more fashionable wearables than LG's watch, and many of them are cheaper, too. But they're not all Android Wear devices—yet. Once Android Wear 2.0 hits new and existing devices, there will be better-looking devices that run Google's wearable OS. The LG Style Watch should be priced at $200 since you're only getting Android Wear 2.0 and the least-capable version of the improved Google Fit. Android Wear 2.0 certainly brings valuable improvements, including an onboard version of the Play Store that lets you download apps to the watch free from companion smartphone apps. But $250 is a lot to ask for a device that is more of a showcase for Android Wear than anything else, as it lacks many of the practical and useful hardware features that other wearable device makers include on cheaper devices.

The Nexus 5X was one of two of Google's last Nexus phones. Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-04 20:55:55 UTC In one fell swoop last October, Google launched its new Pixel phones and killed off its beloved Nexus devices.  If you own a Nexus and still feel betrayed, there might be some good news on the horizon. 9to5Google's Stephen Hall says he was recently told Google might bring the Pixel's Assistant to the Nexus 5X and 6P in a future update. Was recently told that Assistant is finally coming to Nexus 5X/6P soon with next “major” update. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) February 2, 2017 It wouldn't be the first Pixel feature to find its way to the Nexus. Google recently brought the Pixels' "fingerprint swipe" gesture, which lets you swipe up and down on a fingerprint sensor to scroll through notifications to the Nexus 5X, due to popular demand. If Hall's source is right, Google porting the Assistant to the Nexus 5X and 6P would be a dramatic shift in strategy for the company. When the Pixels were announced, Google said the Assistant would be exclusive to its new phones and Google Home. The Assistant, Google said, would be one of the the key differentiators and major selling points of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Google porting the Assistant to the Nexus 5X and 6P would be dramatic shift in strategy. But as I noted in my Pixel review, while the Assistant is good (especially at understanding context), limiting it to just Google hardware hurts more than it helps since it'll only be used by the smaller subset of Android users who can afford to pay big bucks for a premium device.  The rest of Android's users — the midrange and even upper-budget tier — are left completely out of the loop.  Putting the Assistant on more devices (even if they're old ones) would greatly expand its user base and machine-learning capabilities. I'd even argue it's the "Google way" of doing things. Google's Nexus phones might not be the only devices that will get the Assistant. Android TV's getting it via the Nexus Player. Leaks suggest the Assistant will also make its way to the company's two flagship Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which could be announced on Feb. 9. The same goes for LG's upcoming flagship G6 phone.

Google's real 'zoom in, enhance' can fix it Google's neural networks play sketch artist, painting in the blanks of blurry faces to seemingly enhance an image. By Liam Tung | February 8, 2017 -- 14:48 GMT (06:48 PST) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence Human study: The fractions below the images show how many times a person chose the enhanced image over the real image. Image: Google Until now, only Hollywood could zoom and enhance a grainy image to move a plot along with newly clear photographic evidence, but Google's neural network can now do it too. Almost. Google's Brain Team: 'AIs can be racist and sexist but we can change that' Google has devised some mathematical answers to attack discrimination in machine learning. Read More Researchers from Google's AI Brain team have devised a pair of neural networks to look at a blurry eight-pixel by eight-pixel image of a face and reconstruct it. While it can't actually recover details that aren't in the original image, it can, like an artist who has prior knowledge of a face, fill in the blanks in a plausible way. According to Google's researchers, the model they built plays artist by taking details from a real 64-pixel by 64-pixel image, such as a person's hair and face details, to synthesize a 32-pixel image. In this case, the training data was a large number of photos of celebrity faces and bedrooms. "The conditioning network effectively maps a low-resolution image to a distribution over corresponding high-resolution images, while the prior models high-resolution details to make the outputs look more realistic," Google's Brain researchers explain. As Ars Technica notes, the conditioning network maps the blurry image with other high-resolution images that, when shrunk to eight by eight, can be used to find a match. Meanwhile, the prior network has learned that, for example, a brown pixel on the top of the source image is likely to be an eyebrow and so applies hi-res eyebrow-shaped brown pixels to that part of the source. When human observers were shown the real image of a celebrity face versus the computer enhanced images, 10 percent were fooled. Ars notes that 50 percent would be a perfect score. Given the enhanced images are impressions of what the network thinks a blurry image would look like, it probably couldn't be used as evidence in a criminal investigation, however it still may help move an inquiry along.

Think again. Whether making their final purchase in a brick and mortar store or on the internet, there’s a good chance that your consumers are searching online for detailed product information before they commit. In fact, 81 percent of shoppers conduct online research before making a big purchase, according to a study by GE Capital Retail Bank. Typically, manufacturers rely on retailers to provide information about their products to search engines — including such attributes as color, height and weight, product photos and reviews. But, leaving this job to retailers often results in low-quality or incomplete product data online. When this happens, manufacturers’ products don’t show up in online search results as they should, which means missed sales. The good news is manufacturers’ role in e-commerce is changing for the better. New platforms let manufacturers take e-commerce tasks in-house, making it easy to directly supply robust product data to search engines. One such platform is the Google Manufacturer Center, which enables manufacturers to upload authoritative and detailed product content, like descriptions, GTINs, product variants, visual content, reviews and user manuals, all of which improves the performance of ads and the overall visual display on Google, Google Shopping and other Google services. Considering that 60 percent of consumers start product research via search engine, according to the study mentioned above, this is great chance for manufacturers to get their products in front of more potential customers. Let’s take a look at the benefits of taking your e-commerce strategy in-house: 1. Manage your brand. By providing your own product data to search engines, manufacturers can directly influence how their products are represented in search results. Searches usually yield multiple product results, and shoppers are more likely to choose those with robust product content. Make your products more marketable to consumers by supplying a wealth of product content that your shoppers can use to make their purchasing decisions. You can also ensure that the imagery, videos and written content associated with a product page meet your brand’s standards and provide a complete and accurate portrayal of your product, enhancing the shoppers’ experience and strengthening your brand’s identity. 2. Reap the benefits of analytics. By supplying your own data, you’ll be privy to analytics reports, which provide valuable insight into how your products are performing online. This reporting shines a light on consumer behavior beyond what can be learned by looking at sales numbers alone. Analytics show activity throughout the sales cycle, including details about how many shoppers are clicking on your product, the average amount of time spent on your page, how your product is performing against the competition and how its product category is ranking. You can also use these metrics to identify, and then tweak, information in your product listing that is hurting sales. 3. Improve your sales performance. Poor product content can hurt your conversion rate in a number of ways. First, if product data is lacking, your item is less likely to populate in a search query. Or, if consumers do find your product, but descriptive information is sparse, they may search for a similar product with a more thorough description. The better your product data, the higher your conversion rates. Manufacturers directly supplying their own rich product data saw conversion rates jump by four to 13 percent, according to data from Google. If you’re considering taking advantage of this e-commerce opportunity, here are a few things your data should include: A short product title with the brand name A short description that includes keywords to drive SEO Plain language and synonyms (If your name for the product’s color is “clementine,” be sure to also include “orange” somewhere in the description.) An enticing marketing description that also includes keywords A complete list of the product’s features and benefits (At least four bulleted points) All product specs Multiple high-resolution photos Other supplementary content, such as product reviews, demonstration videos and user manuals Today’s shopper doesn’t just want detailed product information before purchasing. She demands it. According to research by Google, two in three shoppers cannot find the information needed to make a purchase in-store and 43 percent of them leave frustrated. And, 71 percent of those in-store shoppers who use smartphones for online research say their device has become more important than their in-store experience. Manufacturers now have the opportunity to provide the product details that consumers are searching for online. If supplying your own data sounds daunting, consider partnering with a data pool (learn more about how to pick one here) who can directly share your product content with platforms like the Google Manufacturer Center.  Don’t rely on retailers to provide the information that determines your business’ bottom line—take your e-commerce destiny into your own hands.

The first asserted that “making America great” requires great broadband, and it discussed an infrastructure initiative to address current broadband shortfalls. This post looks at how broadband policy is likely to play out in the new administration. The third post will focus on the role of cities in assuring that communities have the foundation they will need to thrive in the 21st century global information economy. The ascension of an administration that believes market forces are nearly always sufficient for achieving national goals and protecting consumers will have immediate implications for how regulators conceive of their roles, their willingness to approve mergers, and their willingness to use public policy to advance innovation. Among the sectors likely to feel the effects of the Trump administration’s averred market-focused philosophy is telecommunications, with broadband in particular heavily impacted. Author B Blair Levin Nonresident Senior Fellow - Metropolitan Policy Program If affordable and abundant broadband is integral to the continued growth of the American economy , then how the market reacts to Trump administration policy will determine whether the country can deliver this necessary infrastructure. Here are the four major areas where I expect the Trump administration to impact broadband policy and my predictions for how those reforms may look. Expect a change in how the government considers the competitive landscape In the same way that Google appeared to be driving policy directions at the Obama Federal Communications Commission, the policy preferences of AT&T and Verizon may be a good predictor of the direction of the next one. But just as I thought it unfair and inaccurate to suggest that Chairman Tom Wheeler was in the pocket of Google, I would consider such an allegation against the Chairman Pai (Trump’s choice to lead the FCC) to be misplaced as well. The real story lies in the players’ views of the competitiveness of markets. The Obama and Wheeler policy reflected a view that both wireless and wired broadband markets, as well as the market for key inputs such as set-top boxes and business services, were insufficiently competitive. That view is more consistent with Google’s view of the market, as its core services benefit from faster, better, and cheaper connectivity that it sees lacking in today’s markets. The Wheeler FCC, acting on its view of markets, looked for ways to increase competition, particularly from non-incumbents and smaller players. The Trump and Pai regime are likely to view the wireless market as very competitive and the wired broadband market as sufficiently competitive, a view consistent with AT&T and Verizon’s view. This will lead to a number of advantages for AT&T and Verizon relative to current policy in their competition with smaller wireless players, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), and companies offering video services from “over-the-top” of the network, such as Netflix, Amazon and Google. For example, when it comes to spectrum allocations, set-asides for smaller players are less likely. In business services, the Wheeler effort to lower prices charged by what he viewed as dominant players is likely to be replaced by greater deregulation of the same players, whom the Trump FCC will see as facing significant competition. Expect a change in the range of government oversight The FCC’s oversight of internet service providers (ISPs) will no doubt be significantly reduced. The most highly anticipated change, and the first priority in the telecommunications regulatory space for the industry and Republican leadership, will be to repeal the FCC’s February 2015 Title II reclassification decision. There is some multidimensional chess involved here, meaning the Supreme Court, the FCC, and Congress will all be involved and will premise their actions on the feedback loop created by the actions of the others. Ultimately, rules will be rewritten around the principles of “no blocking and no throttling,” with some forms of paid prioritization (paying for one’s data traffic to be delivered faster than others’ data) and/or zero rating  (data that is not counted against a users’ data caps) allowed. The new rules will likely not include interconnection in the zone of net neutrality protections, though over-the-top video providers are likely to continue to argue for some protection against anticompetitive behavior at interconnection points. It is unlikely, however, that the government will have much sympathy for the contention that ISPs are imposing data caps in an anticompetitive manner. In the near term, these changes are unlikely to affect the services consumers receive or the prices they pay. The impact in the future, however, is harder to gauge. In the Title II decision, the FCC gave itself broad powers to regulate future, unspecified practices that it might view as harming consumers or over-the-top service providers. The Trump agenda will include eliminating that discretion by strictly limiting the FCC’s rulemaking capacity and focusing the agency on enforcement. The result is likely to be increased leverage in business negotiations for those with broadband distribution assets. Expect a change in the center of gravity from the FCC to Congress Since Congress passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the FCC has been the center of gravity for most major policy actions affecting telecommunications. Now, the power will move back to Congress, where three potential pieces of legislation could impact deployment and other concerns in the sector. The most important legislation is a tax bill, which could have diverse impacts on companies given their dissimilar balance sheets, debt structures, revenue mixes, and other factors that could make some winners and some losers. The interesting  policy question is what do the companies do with the extra after-tax income the legislation would create? While the companies often argue that the revenue would lead to greater investment in networks, the money could alternatively be used for acquisitions, dividend hikes, share buybacks, raises for executive, or larger cash reserves. But it is unlikely, in my view, to materially change the investment math that makes deployment of next-generation networks so slow. (There are also likely to be unintended consequences of tax reform; for a good example, it is both useful and amusing to consider this 1999 critique of Senator Bill Bradley’s 1986 tax reform effort, written by a well-known New York real estate developer.) The second piece of legislation is the potential infrastructure bill. Some have raised the question of whether Trump’s infrastructure plan will involve massive investment in broadband infrastructure to compete with cable and telco incumbents. This is possible, but unlikely. First, Trump’s $1 trillion figure is not $1 trillion of direct government investment; a large portion of it will likely come in the form of tax breaks designed to encourage investment. Even if allowed, such tax breaks are unlikely to be sufficient to enable over-builders –those who would deploy new networks to compete with incumbent cable and telco networks–to succeed. Second, Republican leadership is unlikely to support using the tax credits to support investments directly in competitive alternatives and will likely push investment toward Universal Service type investments, which expand broadband to regions and locales that currently have no or limited broadband availability. While Congress is likely to consider the intersection of USF and infrastructure stimulus, there is no clear plan yet for using infrastructure dollars to address the universality goals currently funded through the FCC’s universal service plans. (For a discussion of potential approaches to broadband under a Trump infrastructure bill, please see the first blog.) The third bill would be a focused telecommunications bill, or a series of such bills, on spectrum, Title II reform, and FCC process reform. These will be largely consistent with the general view of Republicans of the limited need for government intervention in presumably competitive markets. They all will have the impact of reducing FCC authority.  While that will not have a significant impact as long as Republicans are in charge, it will make it tougher for Democrats to reassert regulatory control when the power shifts again. Expect an increase in mergers and a change in merger reviews What is easy to predict is that there will soon be a wave of mergers in the sector. Four factors—fear of the Obama Department of Justice, uncertainty about its specific leadership in a new administration, the current incentive auction (which restricts involved parties from talking to each other), and the current broadcast ownership rules—have been suppressing the desire of the companies and their sources of capital to attempt mergers. Those factors will be gone or loosened by the spring, likely resulting in a wave of transactions. Each transaction will have the paradoxical effect of providing incentives for other parties to engage in similar consolidation and for government authorities to reject the kind of deals they just approved, as a second or third deal could cause a market to become anticompetitive.

As a candidate he promised to block the AT&T/Time Warner Entertainment deal and break up Comcast/NBC-Universal, as well as bring an antitrust action against Amazon. All three are possible but unlikely, with the latter two being highly unlikely. The more likely outcome is that the Trump Justice Department and FCC will be significantly friendlier to mergers than the Obama ones were. Two caveats are in order. First, there is a paradoxical relationship between regulation and antitrust. That is, the presence of various kinds of regulations has been offered as a reason not to be concerned about certain kinds of consolidation. For example, at the recent Senate hearing on the AT&T/Time Warner deal, some senators raised concerns about discriminatory treatment of content and its impact on competitors. Proponents defended the deal by suggesting that both economic incentives and regulation would make anticompetitive impacts unlikely. However, by the time the authorities are set to make a decision on the transaction, the effort to remove some of those regulations will be well underway. In short, the effort to simultaneously remove regulations and barriers to consolidation will create some tension as to the relationship between the two efforts. Second, there is still a big unknown as to what Trump himself will do and say about these mergers. Of course, his ability to roil markets by tweeting is already notable, but moving government forces is another matter. For example, after meeting with Trump in December, Robert Johnson, the former chief executive officer of BET, told CNBC he sensed that the president “is going to sit down and negotiate” the AT&T/Time Warner deal just as he did the Carrier jobs deal. I don’t doubt the accuracy or sincerity of Mr. Johnson’s account, but there isn’t a clear path for a President Trump to involve himself in the negotiations. He could tell the Justice Department what to do or even invite the companies to discuss the merger with him personally, but ever since Richard Nixon stifled the antitrust investigation into ITT, a major donor, White House interference in antitrust cases has been seen as a big no-no. Perhaps that precedent no longer constrains actions, but I think even some Republicans would express concerns (far more than in the case of Carrier) for breaching that wall. Further, while AT&T has various government contracts, Trump would have little leverage on antitrust grounds, as the Justice Department staff (and the courts) will likely see the transaction as a vertical deal with limited grounds for rejection. Of course, Trump could more easily tell the FCC what to do, but it appears that AT&T is structuring the deal to avoid FCC jurisdiction. Trump may think he is going to negotiate the deal, but the way things are going, he’ll more likely end up sitting at a poker table with no cards, no chips, and no cash. What doesn’t change Though the dominant theme, particularly in the first six months, will be change, there are some critical areas where a new administration will not change policy or market directions. These include: Cable/telco competition. Nearly all Americans get their fixed home broadband from either a cable provider or a telephone company. Cable is winning, with about a 62 percent market share, and that share is rising. While AT&T and Verizon will be able to improve their positions against other players through regulatory changes, there are limited federal opportunities for AT&T and Verizon to improve their competitiveness with cable through regulation. The major area is with 5G deployment, though the policy issues that affect timing and cost are largely state and local matters. As it did at the Senate hearing last month, AT&T argues (and presumably Verizon would agree) that merger policy is also a key federal policy for increasing competition to cable. But we should not expect that AT&T and Verizon’s increased ability to influence federal policy would enable the companies to improve their market position against cable in the near and mid-term, as federal policy does not affect the core cable advantage of having the cheapest network for transmitting the most bits and the most efficient means to upgrade that network. Spectrum. There is a bipartisan consensus that our economy will need more spectrum to handle a number of developments, from current escalating demand for mobile video to such future developments as 5G, drones, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and the Internet of Things. The Obama Administration and Republicans collaborated on spectrum, leading to new spectrum availability through the AWS-3 and Incentive Auction, FirstNet, and the Spectrum Futures proceeding. That bipartisan approach is likely to continue with an increased focus on how to reallocate spectrum from government use to other uses. (A transcript of a Senate hearing in 2015 on that subject, at which I testified, can be found here.) Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is going to increase in importance for the economy overall, and public policy will play a key role in how it develops. Other than the partisan reaction to election tampering, the issue is usually bipartisan. Unlike in other areas, one can look at the recent Obama White House Commission on Enhancing Cybersecurity Report to see the likely issues the Trump Administration will face and its likely initial approach. The future. Emerging trends in the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence raise a number of issues. Some of these I pointed to in an earlier blog on emerging issues with big data. Others were noted in a White House report this fall on artificial intelligence. None of these issues are simple, nor do they fall neatly into a liberal/conservative framework. They are still nascent but are likely to be front and center in the next few years in both the market and public policy. The Obama Administration provided some thought leadership but did not—nor should it have—laid down irreversible tracks for the likely policies to guide the development of these technologies.

SUBSCRIBE Devices don’t buy products; people do As the number of gadgets in each household proliferates, contributor Asa Whillock discusses the benefits of marketing to people rather than devices. Asa Whillock on February 8, 2017 at 11:01 am More The rise in the number of devices used by individuals has created new challenges — as well as opportunities — for marketers wanting to target their audiences consistently. A typical household utilizes more than seven different devices, and the average person within that household uses about half of them. As a marketer, you want to have compelling, consistent and continuous conversations with your consumers. Perhaps your consumers have registered for your site from both their phones and their laptops, providing you with added insight into who those individuals are. However, if companies track, let’s say, 10 percent of their interactions with consumers this way, that means that nine out of 10 times, they aren’t communicating with them in a seamless way. Today, there are two approaches to addressing this — one of which is the Google and Facebook approach. Using this method, we can say that we saw a Google or Facebook login on three different devices, and therefore, reasonably assume that all three of those devices belong to the same person, thereby increasing our advertising value and informing our strategy. The challenge with this deterministic approach is that it’s oriented entirely around purchasing media with a specific company. Now it’s no longer the marketer’s customer, and you’re locked into buying media on their channel. Another approach is probabilistic. In this scenario, you may not have logins connecting all of a user’s devices, but you can see that certain devices from the same IP address appeared on the advertising exchange. While this approach is useful and doesn’t rely on media purchases, marketers are concerned about the confidence level with this method. Also, there is no concrete evidence confirming that just because they use the same IP address, or have similar HTTP header data, they belong to the same person. The key here is to combine the best of both worlds: observances and algorithms. You also need the most deterministic data available to increase your confidence when tying devices to people — and to achieve confidence in your results while also being able to scale. The benefits of advertising to real people The benefits of marketing to people rather than devices are pervasive across a marketer’s role. The first area to look at is measurement. Advertisers are saying, “Give me confidence in the data that I have about the people who visit me, not just a pile of devices.” When simply looking at impressions, the numbers can be misleading. Being able to accurately assess how you are reaching the people in your audience is critical. Cross-device identification also helps advertisers detail a consumer’s path and understand how a two- or three-step journey across different devices changes how consumers interface with their brand. For example, consumers who see display advertising on mobile and desktop may convert at triple the rate of consumers who only see desktop advertising. This not only affects your analytics, but also impacts how you might segment your audiences and what types of messaging you decide to put in front of them. The alternative to cross-device identification is that the consumer feels that the brand doesn’t really know who they are. Imagine starting from square one with a merchant every time instead of one that recognizes you and caters to your preferences. Being more aware of what a particular person is interested in — and then delivering a consistent experience across their devices — leads to a significantly improved outcome. People-based marketing can enable customization of all devices a consumer uses to consume your brand, allowing you to deliver relevant and personalized experiences on every visit. The key is to expose content to people across all the devices they use, which can save companies from spending money on additional unnecessary ads. You may reach customers five times across the five devices they each use, and then cap further advertising if they’re not necessarily interested. Perhaps the consumer has converted on one of those devices and you can suppress further ads or sequence ads about an additional offering. This provides opportunities to sell value-added services or other similar products. This scenario has proven to be dramatically more effective for both the marketer and the consumer. In fact, we’ve found that advertising to consumers on two or three of their devices allows you to use half as many ad impressions to convert them. Transparency in people-based marketing People-based marketing is becoming a critical part of advertising. Marketers want to feel confident in their data and be able to speak directly to their consumers with competence and accuracy. However, transparency is a key component of people-based marketing. Transparency is about empowering the consumer while simultaneously leveling the scales and empowering the marketer. Consumers want to know what kind of data is being used to represent them, as well as what devices are being connected with them or their activities. They not only want clarity regarding how their devices are linked, but also control. Consumers want the option to say when they don’t want certain devices linked to the others. Transparency is a good practice that benefits consumers and marketers alike. By utilizing a practice that is clear and well understood for the consumer, marketers can leverage sustainable and hygienic data for their organization that is gathered with the highest levels of consumer transparency and trust. We’ve found that when you have this level of transparency and can educate the consumer, they become more comfortable with the experiences. Growing this confidence is perhaps the most critical part of the process, as it brings consumers on board with the business activities and improves their overall experiences with the brand. As the advertising industry paradigm shifts from marketing to people instead of devices, it’s critical that advertisers stay ahead of the curve to provide their consumers with a better, more consistent and personalized content experience across digital touch points.

Updates To Cloud Platforms By Jeff Bennion Feb 7, 2017 at 1:25 PM Shares14 A few years ago, I wrote about the updates that cloud platforms had gone through recently to become more attractive to professionals who use the cloud. Here is an update on where these platforms are now and some updated features that might be of benefit to lawyers. Google Drive Google Drive has added several new features, including the ability to preserve your data when you get an ediscovery hold (lawyers don’t usually get ediscovery holds for their own files, but it’s important to know about this if your clients get an ediscovery hold and they are using Google Docs), and built-in voice typing into documents. The problem is that most of the features require you to use the proprietary Google products like Google Docs and Google Chrome. For example, here’s step two from Google’s help site on voice typing: “Open a document in Google Docs with a Chrome browser.” While many lawyers use Chrome, it’s not very practical to use Google Docs. While it might be possible to edit a note or even a letter in Google’s online-only document editor, what are you going to do when you need to do a table of contents or a table of authorities or format a pleading? For me, sacrificing features I would get in Word to use some new features like voice typing in a dumbed-down editor is just not worth it. Microsoft OneDrive Last time, I described OneDrive as quirky, but powerful. I stand by that today. OneDrive does not work the way other cloud services work. It comes bundled with Office 365, so a lot of you probably already have it. Let me explain how it works. OneDrive has actually three separate hats – SharePoint (for sharing and collaborating with shared folders), OneDrive for Business (your personal business files that others in your team do not see), and OneDrive personal (for personal files and photos). These are three separate files that run on your computer. Say, for example, I have a folder I want to share with someone else in my office and we are both using OneDrive for Business. I can share a folder with that person, but that folder is not added to their OneDrive for Business. They just have access to view its contents when they go to the online portal, but only their own files sync to their computer. Let’s say I am at a site inspection and I take a picture with my cellphone and it uploads directly to OneDrive personal and I want to move that picture to the folder I have set up in OneDrive for Business with the rest of my client folders. I would need to move it out of OneDrive personal and upload it to OneDrive for Business. Files and folders that I have in my OneDrive for Business are not visible to other members of my team unless I share them. SharePoint is the syncing tool that lets you sync team folders. So, say the whole office is working on a client matter and we have that folder syncing to our computers. Any change I make gets synced to the cloud and the computers of my other team members, just like you see with Dropbox and other cloud platforms. The problem is that if you want to use SharePoint, you cannot selectively sync folders. It’s either all or nothing. You can get around this by creating multiple “libraries” in SharePoint. Libraries are collections of documents and folders. So, I can have a pleadings library, a discovery library, and a “video files received from client” library, and choose to only sync the first two. The problem is that this is extremely clunky. OneDrive does have some great features, though. Since it’s a Microsoft product, it plays well with Word and Outlook. There is a button in Outlook to save all email attachments to OneDrive. Likewise, I can attach a file from the cloud easily. You can also save directly to the OneDrive cloud from Word or open files from the cloud in Word, regardless of whether they are synced to your computer. Files with a cloud symbol are form the cloud. Files with no cloud symbol are from my computer. OneDrive also recently got a Windows 10 app that lets you browse all of your offline files in OneDrive for Business and OneDrive Personal accounts. Dropbox Dropbox is a safe tool for lawyers to use if you use the Business or the Pro accounts. That is because of the enhanced security features that those accounts have, such as admin enterprise controls, password-protecting share links, and link expiration. Dropbox has been working on a project called Paper, which is a collaborative note-taking application like Evernote and OneNote. So, it’s a shared virtual whiteboard to jot down notes and sketches. Dropbox also recently released a tool for the business customers only called smart sync. It lets you see all of your files on your computer as if they were synced, but only sync the ones you want. So, I can browse my Dropbox folder on my computer and see all of the files I have synced and the ones that are not synced as well. This is a huge advantage to be able to see all of your case files, but not have them all take up space on your hard drive. https://blogs.dropbox.com/business/2017/01/introducing-smart-sync-and-new-collaboration-tools/ These Products Continue to Evolve The exciting thing is that these products are all getting better and safer every year.

In the race to be more than just a cloud provider, Microsoft and Google are bolstering their product portfolios to make themselves the go-to cloud. First of all we have Google, which is widely considered to have one of the strongest offerings related to data analytics, which has decided to release Google Cloud Search to bring machine intelligence across G Suite. The idea is to make it easy for companies to sort through internal information, because as companies move their data and workloads to the cloud it is becoming increasingly complex. The company said that Cloud Search will bring, “the best of Google Search and machine intelligence to G Suite,” saying that it will provide search and proactive recommendations. As an example the company cites opening the Cloud Search app on your phone, this will show relevant information organised into cards that will help the user to stay on top of their work. Google said: “Assist cards are a new way to help you find the right information at the right time. Using Google’s machine intelligence technology, these cards can help you prepare for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention.” Users will also be able to search for people listed in their company’s directory and then start a hangout, send an email or make a call.  For those worried about the privacy elements of this, Google said that people will only be able to search for and find files that they have access to. Microsoft meanwhile has decided to build a cloud service that is designed to help software to understand specialist vocabularies and to cope with dialects and accents. There have been plenty of examples over the years of voice recognition technology not understanding strong accents or certain dialects, but Microsoft thinks it may have the answer. The company’s Custom Speech Service, which is part of its Cognitive Services suite, can support things like custom acoustic models and the user can assign weightings to what is being said so that the system is essentially being guided. Basically this is like a training course for software that the developer undertakes in order to provide much more accurate applications that support speech input. This latest offering will use the same API as the Bing Speech Service and sits in the Cognitive Services section, which now has 24 different APIs. Microsoft is certainly making a push in this area but plenty of work still needs to be done for tech in this area before it is faultless.

HTTP public key pinning (HPKP) is an important security mechanism when used in conjunction with other communication security protocols to prevent hackers from using wrongly issued digital certificates. Google's Chrome browser, for example, successfully detected a compromise in the root certificate authority DigiNotar, which resulted in a fraudulently issued SSL certificate for Google. Browsers typically validate a web server's certificate by checking its signature hierarchy; the my web server cert is signed by the intermediate cert, which is signed by the root cert, and the root cert is listed in a device's trusted certificates store. However, any certificate authority (CA), or intermediate issuer, can issue a certificate for any website. This means a compromised or rogue CA could wrongly issue certificates for a web server, even if it has no official relationship to the owner of the domain name. The problem of fraudulent digital certificates is growing, and last year saw several instances of certificates being incorrectly issued: Google found unauthorized digital certificates for several of its domains issued by the China Internet Network Information Center, China's main government-run CA. And Netcraft found fake banking websites using domain-validated SSL certificates issued by Symantec, Comodo and GoDaddy. To combat this risk, HPKP allows an HTTPS web server to pin the fingerprint of specific public keys that the browser can trust. After a user visits a site, its HTTP public key pinning policy is stored by the browser so it can reject any future connections that use different, nonwhitelisted keys. This effectively reduces the number of CAs that can issue certificates for a site, which, in turn, reduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack due to a compromised CA. A blog post from a security researcher known as movrcx, and subsequent investigation by researcher Ryan Duff, found that Firefox uses its own static key pinning method, and not HPKP, for Mozilla certificates. This method is flawed, and could allow an attacker with a forged certificate for addons.mozilla.org to cause any Firefox or Tor Browser user (the Tor Browser is based on Firefox) on an attacker-controlled network to receive malicious updates for add-ons they have installed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the targeted device with no user interaction. Although Mozilla pins the certificate for addons.mozilla.org, it appears that if any certificate is compiled directly into Firefox, it is recognized as BuiltIn, and treated as a statically pinned certificate. The only requirement for validation of statically pinned certificates in Firefox is that the certificate validates through to a CA built into the Firefox certificate store, thus skipping normal HPKP checks. This attack requires the perpetrator to obtain a forged certificate for addons.mozilla.org that validates up to a Firefox recognized CA, and though that's not an easy task, it's within the capability of many threat actors -- in 2011, a fake certificate was issued for addons.mozilla.org by Comodo. To ensure all communication to and from a website is authenticated and encrypted, and that HPKP plays an effective role, administrators need to also implement HTTPS, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and HSTS preloading -- HSTS instructs browsers to only communicate with a server using secure HTTPS connections. However, hardly any HTTPS websites use HTTP public key pinning. According to Netcraft's March 2016 SSL survey, less than 0.1% of certificates found were served with the HPKP header, and a third had been misconfigured. The risk of incorrectly deploying HPKP headers is certainly deterring many from using it, as a small misconfiguration can result in a website becoming inaccessible. Once set, a pin remains valid for a period of time. Although HPKP offers a robust defense against website impersonation, it really only makes sense for large and high-profile websites because fraudulently issued certificates are pretty rare, and they are more likely to be used to impersonate popular and well-known websites. Administrators concerned about fraudulent digital certificates may well find Certificate Transparency (CT) a safer and easier solution. It's a protocol proposed by Google for publicly logging every certificate that's issued by compliant CAs, the long-term goal being that browsers will refuse to honor certificates that do not appear in a public CT log. Unlike HTTP public key pinning, it also defends against rogue root certificates installed locally on users' devices. Mozilla and Tor have fixed the problem and have stated that they're not aware of any malicious addons.mozilla.org certificates in the wild. The industry is still searching for the best way to combat fraudulent digital certificates, and they remain difficult to defend against. Every internet user is reliant on CAs and the digital certificates they issue to provide trust and to secure their online activities, and users and their data are very exposed when that model of trust is broken. Enterprises at risk from nation state attacks must carefully monitor for news of potential rogue certificates and the services that may be affected, so they can mitigate any risks as soon as possible.

Now it's your turn From startup Mindshow to Google to Oculus, the latest trend in virtual-reality storytelling is to put more control of its creation in your hands. Virtual Reality Apps by Joan E. Solsman February 8, 2017 7:16 AM PST @joan_e Start-up Mindshow is creating a virtual-reality app that lets you create your own animated movies in VR, with the app handling the heavy-lifting of making the characters, sets and props for you. Mindshow I created my own virtual-reality cartoon, and the only skill required was my willingness to look ridiculous. My clip, in which I play both a hollering alien and the space captain he threatens, was the product of Mindshow, an app from Los Angeles startup Visionary VR. Think of the app as if Pixar jumped into VR and fused Minecraft with music-mixing software GarageBand. The app features a library of animated characters, props and settings for you to inhabit and edit into a sharable clip. And it all feels like playtime. After initially figuring out how to combine virtual reality and narrative, Visionary VR decided to open things up. "There is a greater opportunity than enabling our own ability to tell stories," CEO Gil Baron said. "It's enabling everyone else to." Related stories Robots, video games, sci-fi: The perfect VR film for geeks 'Dear Angelica': A VR film that steps inside a painter's brain Peter Dinklage takes you on tech's not-too-distant mind warp Mindshow is the purest example of the latest undercurrent in VR storytelling: how to give you a bigger role to play. It's the latest pitch for the medium, which uses screens in motion-sensitive headsets to throw viewers into wild digital worlds. With the likes of Facebook and Google backing it, VR has been hailed as the next big thing. In fact, 2016 was supposed to be a splashy year for VR. Last year marked the launch of three high-profile systems: the Oculus Rift from Facebook, the Vive from phone maker HTC and video game developer and distributor Valve, and the Playstation VR from Sony. Meanwhile, Samsung said early this year that it had shipped 5 million Gear VR headsets since their late 2015 launch. But the reality check is that the release of hardware alone isn't enough to sustain hype, and critics argue that insufficient content crimps VR's appeal. So creators working on narrative VR -- and the companies that fund them -- have started to ask themselves how they can put VR storytelling into people's hands. Mindshow, which was on display last month at the Consumer Electronics Show and at the Sundance Film Festival, literally puts you in control of the story. With the Vive's hand controllers and headset, you perform any story you invent, whether you play a tuxedo-wearing puppy or anthropomorphic Twinkie. Others making VR movies have also started to dip their toes in interactivity, giving viewers more agency over the telling of a tale. And the deep-pocketed companies making VR hardware are shoveling money and tech tools to more people, hoping to turn diverse filmmakers and regular folks like you and me into VR creators too. Tech giants Facebook placed its bet on VR three years ago with its $3 billion purchase of headset-developer Oculus, but the company didn't turn off the funding spigot once it had the hardware. In October, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had invested $250 million in virtual-reality content and pledged another $250 million, plus $10 million each for educational and diversity programs in VR. Many of those funds are earmarked for bringing people into VR who otherwise might not initially show interest. One of the diversity efforts is VR for Good, which matches a nonprofit with a filmmaker to collaborate with Oculus on virtual-reality movies. Along with Launch Pad, the company's effort to encourage filmmakers to address social issues using VR, Oculus has been widening the net so a greater variety of people can take advantage of the medium. Mindshow turned me into a VR alien Virtual-reality company Mindshow lets anyone create movies in VR, by handing over a library of characters and settings that you can jump into virtually. by Joan E. Solsman 0:26 Close Drag Google has been making similar moves through its YouTube arm. Since Google's launch of the Daydream VR headset in November, YouTube looked at the dozen biggest content categories on its massive video site -- vlogging, beauty tutorials, game play, for example -- and identified creators in each one to pair with a VR studio, according to Jamie Byrne, YouTube's director of creators and VR initiatives. In some cases, the company would bless the creator with a Jump rig, a VR shooting setup that stitches together video captured by 16 cameras to create 360-degree footage. It also loaned out Jump rigs and provided them at its YouTube Spaces in Los Angeles and New York to any YouTuber with more than 10,000 subscribers. "We're really focused on getting the tools in the hands of more creators, because that is where the innovation will come from," said Byrne. Both Google and Oculus have released programs to enable anyone to make their own VR. Tilt Brush, a VR app from Google, turns hand controllers into a virtual paintbrushes, letting people craft 3D illustrations around them in a virtual room. Oculus' similar program, Quill, is taking the concept one step further. Later this year, Quill will update with a timeline feature, essentially letting anyone toy with drawing their own animated time-lapse VR movies. Tiptoeing into interactivity The rush to make content for VR headsets led to rapid schooling among VR filmmakers. That has turned festivals like Sundance -- which will be followed by South by Southwest in Austin, VRLA in Los Angeles and the Tribeca Film Festival in New York -- into hot spots to show off filmmakers' newfound chops. Last month, in the chaotic tent at Sundance deemed "VR Palace," many experiences tiptoed toward more viewer control. "Asteroids!," for example, is the followup to a bunny-meets-aliens VR short released last year by VR studio Baobab. The studio has a deal to make traditional animated feature-films based on characters it has been developing for VR. The trend of 2017 in VR is to put more control in your hands -- even if you look silly in the process. Josh Miller/CNET "We don't do branching stories," said Eric Darnell, Baobab's creative chief and the director of the "Madagascar" animated movies. "One story, told well, is hard enough." But with "Asteroids!," his team approached interactivity for the first time as "branching emotions," letting viewers forge a deeper connection by giving them a limited role in a character's fate. One experience, "Life of Us" by the studio Within, ventured into multiplayer narrative VR, another first. The plot of the story is unalterable, but you're joined virtually by someone else experiencing the same film through a headset in a different room. As the story barrels through trippy, hyperspeed stages of human evolution, you can talk and laugh together, and swat monkeys off each other's backs, literally. (Well, virtually.) Mindshow doesn't so much as tiptoe toward interactivity as bum-rush it. That app, which lets you take on the role of VR actor and director, is set to be released in a beta version later this year. "We need to get out of the way and just provide the means," said Jonnie Ross, Mindshow-maker Visionary's chief creative officer. "Essentially, let's crowdsource what the future of storytelling is." So does the future look like a talking Twinkie? If that's as fun as virtually body-swapping with a scowling green alien, I really hope so. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

Name: Subject: Message: NVIDIA Shield TV (2017) review – come for TV, stay for the gaming! Reviewsby Joshua Vergara3 days ago 4 371 8 The word ‘Shield’ has become synonymous with gaming, thanks to the lineup of NVIDIA’s entertainment-forward portables, tablets, and TV boxes. A little over a year ago, NVIDIA brought not only Android to the small screen, but their own version of gaming Netflix to let the masses experience video games in a different way. Now, with a slimmed down design and a few upgrades both, under the hood and in the cloud, NVIDIA is looking to make the TV the companion home for Google and gaming to come together. Does it succeed? Here’s our review of the NVIDIA Shield TV (2017). One thing I should mention before we continue – none of the televisions that I used while testing this new Shield TV are 4k capable nor can they leverage the HDR gaming that NVIDIA made such a big deal about. While I am sure that the 4K HDR features make this gaming box future proof for any users that may get a capable television sometime soon, I cannot share any opinions on one of the few features that truly sets this Shield apart from its earlier incarnations. NVIDIA has taken a few steps to make the new Shield TV pack even more power in a smaller package. Though it retains a similar aesthetic to the original, the base model Shield TV has a smaller footprint that can also be stood up with an optional official accessory. The Shield TV Pro has a larger overall design that accommodates a built-in 500GB hard drive and a microSD card slot, both of which are absent in our regular unit. The rear of the Shield TV sports all of the ports for connectivity – this includes an Ethernet port for wired internet access, an HDMI port, and two USB ports for charging devices like the Shield Controller and for connecting external drives. For that matter, external drives prove to be a necessity for this box because it only comes with 16GB of onboard storage with only 11 available to the user. Connected drives can be used as removable storage or can be formatted as actual device space for apps and app data. USB 3.0 drives are the bare minimum for reliability – in my case, a USB 3.0 SSD made even more sense and my Sandisk added over 200+ GB of storage that I have happily populated with games. Users of the previous NVIDIA Shield TV will find the included remote control to be familiar, with the four way navigation circle closing around the selection button up top, the back and home buttons underneath, and a large microphone button that triggers voice search, upgraded in this new model to the full-on Google Assistant. What we thought was quite slick was the touch sensitive area that lines the bottom half, where users can slide finger up and down in order to increase or decrease the volume. That volume slider is now found on the updated Shield Controller, which also comes in the package. Compared to the previous model, the Shield Controller is significantly smaller and falls in line with the NVIDIA design language utilizing angular shapes and lines. It is similar in layout to a Playstation 4 controller but uses the A/B/X/Y face button layout that is common for XBox or Windows games. The NVIDIA button in the middle still triggers Google Assistant, while underneath it are dedicated buttons for home, back, and a centered start button mainly used in games. The aforementioned volume slider replaces the touchpad that was used in the previous Shield Controller for moving a virtual mouse around various interfaces. Update: Yes, an update will come to bring the full, proper Google Assistant to the Shield TV – my comments here are based on the current iteration (voice search or whatever you want to otherwise describe it) that came with the very recent Nougat update. My mistake, apologies – a full video showing off the proper Google Assistant capabilities will come when the final version arrives. The good news is that a full Google Assistant may indeed make the Shield TV as good as Google Home, like I said I wanted it to. Thanks for watching/reading and for your feedback! – Josh All parts of the Shield TV design delightfully scream ‘NVIDIA’ and will look exactly how gamers expect – the green trim on the controllers and the green light on the box itself are eye-catching without looking gaudy, making them worthy additions to anyone’s existing television setup. Once the Shield TV is hooked up, you’re good to go. Holding down on the home button brings up the controls where one can take a screenshot, record a gaming segment with or without the microphone turned on (either the mic on the controller or on a pair of plugged in headphones), or even broadcast live to places like Twitch or YouTube Live. There are virtually no places that are off limits for the recording, meaning that the homescreens and even the settings areas can be captured or streamed. It should be mentioned, however, that the voice recording stops when playing any Geforce Now streams. The quality of the video is quite good, recording Full HD footage that can be edited and uploaded to YouTube – the audio capture, however, is serviceable but far from the best sounding voice recording for this kind of application. That adds to the crux of the NVIDIA Shield’s focus, which has always been an emphasis on gaming. Back when the original NVIDIA Shield TV was released, NVIDIA Grid was the company’s own gaming solution that was touted as the ‘Netflix of gaming.’ This meant that games could be streamed from NVIDIA’s own servers straight to your Shield device – a solution that was different but potentially added to any existing setups gamers had streaming their own games from NVIDIA GPU powered rigs. Well, Grid is now essentially known as Geforce Now, and marries the subscription model with the current method of video game purchases. For $8 a month, gamers can instantly stream games from NVIDIA’s own servers with varying degrees of quality and latency depending mostly on the internet connection. What is impressive is the library of games included with the subscription – games range from early titles to more recent AAA franchises, like Tomb Raider and Sleeping Dogs to Batman: Arkham Origins. New games can be purchased for their full price but are only played via the Geforce Now streaming service – the most recent AAA title made available at the time of this review was No Man’s Sky. Not all PC games are made available through this service, but there is a good breadth of products for even seasoned gamers to enjoy – if they haven’t already bought their own copies on Steam or otherwise. That is the main issue I understand many gamers might have – why would they pay an extra full price on top of a subscription service for games they are already have? Personally, I didn’t suffer from this issue because I haven’t gotten around to many of the titles that are included with the Geforce Now subscription – basically, your gaming mileage may vary. Playing games via Geforce Now, however, is about as easy as can be. Very little data storage is taken up on the device because the game is being streamed – the quality of the stream depends on one’s internet connection, and I have one main tip to get the most out of it: go Ethernet. Even fast routers may have problems getting the sheer amount of data needed for a good quality stream, as it did in my experience. Getting an Ethernet cable into the Shield made for an immensely better gaming experience that I could see myself using for full playthroughs without any issues. What surprised me the most was the input response time – you would think that inputs from the gamepad would take a noticeable amount of time to register on a streamed game, but when the connection is good, the game is virtually one-to-one to a local experience. Fighting as Batman or Wei Shen felt right – a feat that can be tough to recreate in a stream compared to local play. While i did have a couple of drops in connection to NVIDIA’s USA servers, reconnecting simply required opening the game again and the stream was still available for me to pick up where I dropped out. You’re basically streaming a game from NVIDIA’s own computer – literally. Those drops were a little harrowing in Batman: Arkham Origins because the game kept playing while I was gone – this resulted in Batman losing a little life while I was stuck in the Android TV interface for a few seconds. Thankfully, these drops only happened those couple of times and haven’t been an issue since. NVIDIA gaming is still about as good as ever, providing an actually reliable way for gamers to get their fix without needing a crazy rig or even the actual game in some cases. However, this is an Android TV box and, as such, much of the Google Play Store is at your disposal. Most games that are available for your smartphone can be converted to your larger television screen and with the Shield controller the gaming experience can be multitudes better. Games that have been adapted for Android TV also leverage the gamepad and this is far better than even the best touch controls. I focused mainly on RPG games with my Shield TV, installing and enjoying Final Fantasy 9 and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. I’ve made the point in the past – Android is a wonderful place to enjoy classic and retro games. So many past games have made the conversion to mobile that nostalgic players can enjoy them in an updated, current fashion and new gamers can see why we look back on titles like Jade Empire and Chrono Trigger so wistfully. And with the NVIDIA Shield TV, all of these games get a bit of new life in a format that is spiritually like a console. There is no shortage of power to play everything in the NVIDIA or Google library, as the powerful Tegra X1 and 3GB of RAM have been reliable and speedy throughout all experiences. The Android iteration on the Shield TV isn’t without its holes – from the gaming standpoint, some games that have gotten plenty of play on my phones are still not adapted to the television. My main example is any 3D Grand Theft Auto game whereas Chinatown Wars is prominently shown in the NVIDIA Games hub. And even then, some games are available for installation but aren’t gamepad ready, so playing them is more of a nuisance than they really should be. And from a purely entertainment standpoint, there’s little to fault Android TV for – so many of the expected video services make it here, from Plex to Netflix to Kodi to network applications like Comedy Central and ABC. There is no shortage of content available for one’s viewing pleasure. I was a bit miffed to find the listening experience quite lacking, in which applications like NPR Now and Pocket Casts didn’t seem to make the Android TV cut while Google Play Music is pre-installed; thankfully, the solution for this is to simply Cast the content to the Shield’s built-in Google Home capabilities. So, the experience with the Shield TV is largely the same but definitely refined and updated for the current gamer or entertainment buff in all of us. NVIDIA made a big deal, however, of adding in a tool for even better utility – Google Assistant. Google Voice Search has always been a part of the Shield experience, but now it gets a facelift to look like the Assistant we’ve become used to since the dawning of the Pixel. Unfortunately, much of what I might end up using the Pixel Google Assistant for somehow doesn’t translate to the television experience. One glaring difference is the lack of a ‘Daily Briefing’ voice trigger, which would give me the weather and then play one of many news podcasts on my smartphone. Instead, I get a number of YouTube search results regarding Donald Trump. The same lack of functionality shows even in the searches that trigger proper results – a search for actors or movie trivia only shows the same top splash screen that you’d get in a Google web search, without an accompanying voice dictation. For such a powerful Android box, the focus on entertainment and gaming seems to be a little bit too strong for NVIDIA to actually call it full-on Google Assistant – and I would use Google Assistant more if it was as capable on my television as it is on my smartphone. All in all, the NVIDIA Shield TV is a ton of fun in a box, with a delightfully short list of caveats. NVIDIA continues to champion the gaming focus of their Shield products and it shows in their conversion of Android into a console experience. Built-in recording and streaming features help the more avid players tap into a now huge community of gamers sharing their playthroughs. Geforce Now is an effective but limited way to get a gaming fix and gamepad-ready games are a joy to play on a bigger screen and with the Shield controller, which is still the best one to use in the mobile space. The actual Android iteration has a few growing pains that are at once mitigated by built-in Google Cast support but continuously frustrates due to some losses in translation. Google Assistant is great to have, on paper at least, but it has some ways to go if it is to compete with Amazon’s Alexa that is being injected in multiple products; in the new NVIDIA Shield TV, it simply doesn’t bring enough yet. Bolstering support for functions that Google Assistant relies upon is the first step, then Google Assistant can make those strides forward. For everyone that is looking for a better way to play their Android games and to watch their streaming services, NVIDIA has continued to provide the best apparatus for doing just that.

It's a move that might seem in contradiction to the certifications already offered by Udacity through its Android Developer Nanodegrees, again co-created by Google, but in contrast to a Nanodegree, getting hold of this certification doesn't require attending a lengthy or expensive course, in which you do projects and stick to class deadlines. The candidate has to only take a one-off exam for a fee of $149. It requires the downloading of a few Android Studio project files and working on them for a period of  48 hours of work before  handing them over for their grading. The actual download is a startup project that the candidate has to modify to accommodate new  functionality and bug fixing.Of course, it goes without saying that in order to be successful, the candidate has to be a seasoned developer. Thus the kind of developers that this certification targets are those that have obtained their skill set through sources such as practical experience or engaging in learning activities, online or otherwise, and who need to obtain certification to officially attest their skills or get past a job interview's entry level barrier.     This certification, clearly influenced by Udacity's hands-on learning approach, is designed around the latest requirements sought after by the modern workforce marketplace. As such the candidate will be asked to display competency in the following application development areas: Testing and Debugging Candidates should be able to analyse application crashes, and find common bugs such as layout errors and memory leaks. Application User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Candidates should have a working knowledge of using view styles and theme attributes to apply a consistent look and feel across an entire application.  Fundamental Application Components Candidates should be able to describe the types of application logic that would be best suited for each component, and whether that component is executing in the foreground or in the background. Persistent Data Storage Candidates should be able to describe platform features that allow applications to store data securely and share that data with other applications in a secure manner. Enhanced System Integration Candidates should understand how to provide proper navigation from these external interfaces into the application's main task, including appropriate handling of deep links. After the exam's submission, subsequent grading, and successful passing of the exam, there is still an exit interview awaiting candidates, in which they have to explain their work in their own words.   Although the mere act of passing the exam does not assure the landing of a job, if you're an experienced Android developer but lacks an official accreditation you still might want to take advantage of this opportunity.   More Information Introducing Associate Android Developer Certification by Google Android Developer Nanodegree Related Articles Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Artificial Intelligence Engineer Nanodegree From Udacity   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.  IoT Home Inspector Challenge 12/01/2017 Smart home technology is intended to make our homes more more convenient to control and better protected.

Credit: PHConcepts/Steel DrakeMore Credit: PHConcepts/Steel DrakeSamsung is planning to support up to eight different languages when Bixby launches with the Galaxy S8 later this year, according to a report from ETNews and earlier discovered by Samsung-tracking site Sammobile. According to the report, Bixby will come with support for English, Korean, and Chinese, among other languages. If Bixby supports eight languages, it would put the virtual personal assistant far ahead of Google's alternative, Google Assistant. Google's option only supports a handful of languages, including English and German. However, Bixby will trail Apple's Siri, which comes with support for more than 20 languages. MORE: Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumors: What Features to Expect Bixby is the result from last year's Samsung acquisition of Viv Labs, a company that was founded by the folks behind Siri. Viv was working on an advanced artificial intelligence service that has become the backbone for Bixby. According to several reports, Bixby will debut with the Galaxy S8. The feature could be activated by a physical button that would sit on the side of the device. Once you press the button, Bixby will turn on and give you the ability to issue vocal commands, search the Web, create to-do lists, and more. Speculation abounds over when the Galaxy S8 and thus, Bixby, will be unveiled. Samsung has already said it won't showcase its new device at Mobile World Congress later this month, leaving many to believe that the handset will be presented at a press event in March or April. Either way, Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S8 in April. When it hits store shelves, expect to find a curved screen up to 6.2 inches in size, a new design, and a home button baked into the screen. The Galaxy S8 will also be the first smartphone to run Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor.

For the first time, Android 7.0 and 7.1 combined are now on more than one percent of Android devices. With Samsung scheduled to update the Galaxy S7 sometime this month, those numbers will likely increase significantly. Marshmallow usage, meanwhile, continues to grow. After increasing its share of the platform by 1.1 percentage points, 6.0 is now 30.7 percent of Android devices. It’s now the third most used version of Android after Lollipop. Between 5.0 and 5.1, Lollipop is on 32.9 of Android devices. Moreover, older versions of the OS like ICS and KitKat continue their decline. Respectively, they shed share by 0.1 and 0.7 percentage points. That said, KitKat remains the second most used version of Android. Google built out February’s data set based on Android devices that accessed the Google Play Store in the seven-day period ending February 8th.

I fail to see how Marshmallow is #3. It’s either an error and should read “second” or there’s something in the numbers I fail to understand… Igor Bonifacic 5.0 (9.8 percent) and 5.1 (23.1 percent) together are on 32.9 percent of devices. By contrast, Marshmallow is on 30.7 percent of devices. HiKsFiles What kind of logic is that?! Combining the numbers of two versions of the same OS doesn’t count for 2 places, it only counts for one. Following your logic, we could do the same considering Android 4.x as on single version and state that Android 4.x currently accounts for 34.2% of the install base and, since every “dot version” counts for one place, then Marshmallow would be ranked 8th. Not that I care very much anyway, but your logic is clearly flawed here. Igor Bonifacic Except Google itself considers 4.0.3 – 4.0.4, 4.1 – 4.3 and 4.4 to all be disparate versions of Android, whereas 5.0 and 5.1 both fall under the Lollipop umbrella. You can even see that in how the company present its data (the chart and pie graph were taken directly from Google). 4.1.x, 4.2.x and 4.3, for example, are all grouped under Jelly Bean. HiKsFiles Well there you go! Looking at that same pie chart, explain me how is Marshmallow third… Igor Bonifacic Look at the pie chart carefully. It’s organized by version order, not share percentage. Lollipop’s share of the pie is clearly greater than Marshmallow’s. Patrick O’Rourke You guys are making me hungry with all this talk of pastries. Samuel Gomez Recuero Why is it that Kitkat still have that many. Some OEMs should have never used it for their products, and those buying cheap tablets with kitkat are the ones to blame.

Following roundtable discussions chaired by the UK's Intellectual Property Office, all parties have agreed that the code should take effect by June 1, 2017. For several years the entertainment industries have blamed companies like Google for not doing enough to prevent instances of Internet piracy. At times, Google has even been accused of fueling it. The problem is with search results. Whether they’re presented by Google, Bing or Yahoo, copyright holders wish that more could be done to prevent the appearance of infringing links, particularly in the first crucial pages of results. To its credit, Google has taken a number of measures over the years but in the eyes of copyright holders, it’s never been enough. Instead, Google has been flooded with a billion takedown requests in the last year alone, each demanding that links to infringing content be removed. When the notices are accurate, Google always complies but there have been rumblings in recent years, particularly in the UK, that search engines could find themselves on the end of legislation that forces them to do more. With that eventuality a daunting prospect, companies like Google and representatives from the entertainment industries have been trying to reach some kind of voluntary agreement. Their meetings generally aren’t spoken about in public, but the UK government has played a strong role in bringing the groups together. What we now know is that a deal is extremely close to being signed. This week, during a Digital Economy Bill committee, discussion again turned to the role of service providers when it comes to infringing content. For example, should they enjoy reduced safe harbors if they optimize the presentation and promotion of copyright-protected works? A draft amendement to the bill would allow the government to impose a code of practice on search engines, forcing them to deal with infringement – a proposal that has proven popular in parliament. However, when the matter was raised again this week it was revealed that the imposition of such a regime probably won’t be needed. “Since the idea was last discussed in [parliament], Intellectual Property Office officials have chaired a further round-table meeting between search engines and representatives of the creative industries,” Baroness Buscombe said. “While there are still elements of detail to be settled, the group is now agreed on the key content of the code and I expect an agreement to be reached very soon.” According to Buscombe, all parties involved (that’s the search engines and entertainment industry companies) have agreed that the code should come into effect within four months. “All parties have also agreed that the code should take effect, and the targets in it be reached, by 1 June this year,” the Baroness said. With no such meetings ever documented in public by either the companies involved or the government, TorrentFreak reached out to Google – who are definitely at the hub of the agreement – with a few questions. What companies are involved in the agreement, both from the search side and entertainment industries? What are the basics of the voluntary code and how will it affect the visibility of allegedly-infringing results? How will the agreement manifest itself to Google’s users come June 1? At the time of publication, Google had not responded to our request for comment. However, without mentioning them by name, Baroness Buscombe was complimentary about Google and the other search engines involved, noting that cooperation with entertainment companies is ongoing. “The search engines involved in this work have been very co-operative, making changes to their algorithms and processes, but also working bilaterally with creative industry representatives to explore the options for new interventions, and how existing processes might be streamlined,” she said. “I understand that all parties are keen to finalize and sign up to the voluntary agreement, and so we believe there is no need to take a legislative power at this time.” Noting that moving forward on a co-operative basis now is better than introducing legislation later, the Baroness said that other options could always be revisited in the future, should things not work out. At this stage, however, it seems unlikely that Google et al would prefer legislation over a voluntary code. Due to the worldwide nature of the web, it will be extremely interesting to see how any UK-based agreement plays out overseas. It seems unlikely that Google will be able to implement strictly local measures without coming under pressure to follow suit in the United States, for example.If you can do it in the UK, you can do it everywhere, the company will be told.

News Business Business News Microsoft donated $500,000 for Donald Trump's inauguration before filing legal brief against President's 'Muslim ban' Google and Amazon also gave money and services for the event Ben Chapman Wednesday 8 February 2017 14:35 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online A view of the crowd at the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration of President Trump on January 20 2017 Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post Silicon Valley companies who have backed a legal brief against Donald Trump’s immigration ban donated money and services for his inauguration, Politico has reported. Microsoft donated $250,000 (£200,000) in cash and provided services of the same value, according to the report. Google and Amazon also each provided undisclosed cash amounts as well as technical services. All three now have now publicly decried the US President’s ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Prior to the donations being made, Mr Trump had already promised to ban all Muslim immigration to the US, “until we find out what the heck is going on”.

The gift would have entitled the company to a host of benefits including two tickets to “an intimate policy discussion and dinner with Vice President Mike Pence and Mrs Karen Pence” along with entrance to a series of other lobbying events with top-level administration staff, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee website. Google provided a YouTube livestream of the event and an unspecified donation, while Facebook supplied Instagram photo booths and a "mini Oval Office", Politico reported, citing sources close to the matter. Uber and Twitter told Politico they did not donate to the inauguration. Apple has yet to comment, but explicitly withdrew from the Republican National Convention in July 2016 over fears about being associated with Mr Trump's controversial remarks about women and minorities. Despite widespread concern about Mr Trump's controversial views, the President raised a record $90m for his inauguration, far surpassing the $44m President Barack Obama raised in 2013 and the $53m he raised in 2009, Time reported. Oil giant, Chevron, gave $500,000 while Boeing, which has been a target of the President’s Twitter barbs, gave $1m.

 Advertisers say Snapchat's unique selling point is that it's the cool, new thing — which puts a lot of pressure on the company to stay relevant Lara O'Reilly Feb. 8, 2017, 9:08 AM 1,497 facebook linkedin twitter email print Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel. Getty/Michael Kovac Snapchat is at the mercy of competitors like Facebook and Google that can simply copy its products. Advertisers say Snapchat's unique selling point is that it is cool, new, and has created its own advertising "currency." But ad-buyers also need Snapchat to do more to prove its ads actually drive sales if they are going to commit meaningful budgets to the platform. Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. lifted the lid on its advertising business when it made its IPO public earlier this month.  We found out that the company generated $404.4 million in revenue in 2016 (up 6x year-on-year), that it has 158 million daily active users, but also that its daily active user growth was flat in the quarter to September 30, 2016. BI Intelligence That was the same quarter in which Instagram launched its Snapchat-clone Instagram Stories — allowing users to share videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours. Instagram says the feature is used by 150 million users each day, which is a very similar number to Snapchat's total daily active user base.  In the "risk factors" section of Snap Inc.'s S-1 filing, the company concedes that it competes with companies like Apple, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Google, and Twitter — all of which have "significantly greater financial and human resources and, in some cases, larger user bases." The S-1 continues: "Snapchat is free and easy to join, the barrier to entry for new entrants is low, and the switching costs to another platform are also low. Moreover, the majority of our users are 18-34 years old. This demographic may be less brand loyal and more likely to follow trends than other demographics. These factors may lead users to switch to another product, which would negatively affect our user retention, growth, and engagement ... Falling user retention, growth, or engagement could make Snapchat less attractive to advertisers and partners, which may seriously harm our business." So if rivals have bigger user bases and the financial and human resources to build copies of the products that make Snapchat stand out, what is it that Snapchat offers advertisers that they can't get from any other platform? We asked a range of media buyers to find out. People in the advertising industry seem impressed that there is a new player on the block that is challenging the market to produce new formats and meaningful metrics — but the young advertising business still has a long way to go if it is to start commanding the kind of ad spend that Facebook and Google can. Snapchat is cool and taps into young people's latest 'obsessions' As Snapchat itself notes, the majority of its users are the young advertising segment most advertisers look to target. Users under 25, it says, visit Snapchat more than 20 times and spend more than 30 minutes on the app each day. It may have fewer users than its rivals, but, for now at least, they are highly-engaged, and data suggests Snapchat is still the cool new thing among young people compared to apps like Facebook that their parents use.  Jason Stein, CEO of social media agency Laundry Service, said: "Snap is the sexy new platform and to succeed on Snapchat as a brand is to be cutting edge, relatable, and relevant to young people. You're seen not only as making the effort to speak to this youth audience on their terms — but a brand that is actually 'young' and cool enough to do so." Noah Mallin, head of social North America at WPP media agency MEC, said Snapchat offers an impressive and growing suite of ad products that taps into three of the "biggest obsessions consumers have right now": messaging, augmented reality, and visual storytelling. As Snap details in its S-1, the same team that designs Snapchat's consumer products also designs its advertising products, which means it creates ad products "that feel familiar to our community," like full-screen videos, Sponsored Lenses, and Sponsored Geofilters. That's a compelling story for advertisers, according to Mallin. But Facebook offers messaging products through Messenger and WhatsApp, and augmented reality and visual storytelling through Instagram. What makes Snapchat so different? Mallin responded: "It's across different platforms with Facebook rather than all Facebook in one place — for now — and the augmented reality elements aren't yet part of the core experience there. Another big difference is that what binds people to Snapchat initially is the camera-first messaging experience. Messenger is trying to pivot there but that really isn't the core of any of Facebooks products hook users with — at least not yet." Its ad formats are unlike anything else Snapchat doesn't copy and paste its ad formats from elsewhere on the web. Where else can you buy a Sponsored Geofilter that lets users add branded location-based stickers to their photos, or a Sponsored Lens that lets people turn their faces into a Taco Bell taco? Tech Insider Catie Dear, head of entertainment at UK media agency at The7Stars, said Snapchat's focus on "sound-on" video ads has been appealing to its entertainment clients. Lots of entertainment brands use Snapchat to land new movie trailers or tracks from artists — the first ever Snapchat advertiser was 20th Century Fox, promoting its "Ouija" horror movie. Dear said: "Working with entertainment brands, it's important for someone to hear sound, which isn't that common an offering in the [digital ad] market at the moment ... Snapchat is also about telling a different brand story. The behavior on the app is very different as you want to focus more on shorter content, whereas on Instagram, people tend to watch longer videos." Dominique Delport, global managing director of the Havas Media Group, has also been impressed that Snapchat has created its own ad currency, forcing advertisers to be creative. He said: "Even media publishers that are part of the Discover [content section within the Snapchat app] had to completely rethink the way they present their content because Snappers skipped it in three seconds. They have been instrumental in imposing the vertical video format — again, smart and insightful. [There is a feeling] that Facebook and Instagram are chasing them big time — and there was an impact in the last quarter — but I'm very optimistic on their ability to create, surprise, and delight their audience — and the Adland community." Snapchat needs to constantly prove its advertising actually works But being the cool new thing with never-before-used ad formats comes with challenges: The company needs to constantly create cool new things and Snapchat needs to consistently prove its ads actually work if it is to move from the small experimental section of advertisers' budgets and into the big leagues. Snap included research from Advertiser Perceptions in its S-1 document that showed it ranked first in overall advertiser satisfaction in September 2016. Snap Inc./SEC Snap has been making huge improvements in this area and it now offers 15 different third-party measurement solutions in the US, including partnerships with companies like Nielsen, Moat, Oracle, and Millward Brown. The S-1 also details its internal "Snap-to-Store" measurement product that uses the location-based features of the Snapchat app to determine whether people who saw an ad on the app went on to visit a retail store.  But, with its relatively young advertising business (it only began selling ads at the end of 2014), Snapchat is playing catch-up to its digital media rivals. And even the two most dominant players — Facebook and Google — get accused of "marking their own homework" when it comes to advertising measurement. Advertisers take a lot of convincing to shift their budgets from the traditional channels they have been using for decades to build their brands. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Snap is seeking huge commitments from media buyers of between $100 million and $200 million. For a company like WPP, that type of agreement could see it more than double its Snapchat ad spend of $90 million in 2016. But other advertising holding companies would be significantly upping — likely tripling — their Snapchat spend if they were to agree to such commitments. (Here's a primer on how advertising commitments tend to work.) But a source at one media-buying network, who declined to be named, said Snapchat still doesn't have the advertising metrics in place to drive the level of commitment it is asking for. In the S-1, Snapchat says its vertical video ads are "as good as television" — and in some ways better — because users can choose to skip ads, swipe up to interact with them, and advertisers can use more granular targeting than TV. But with AdAge reporting in November that the average Snapchat video ad lasts less than three seconds and Snapchat counting a video "view" as soon as the video opens, it remains to be seen whether its ads are more effective than those on TV. Snapchat has moved quickly to provide measurement options, but it needs to be seen as the platform that can drive meaningful business results — which requires numerous case studies, b2b marketing, and yet more measurement capabilities — if it is going to take a slice of the big ad budgets. Despite their gripes, most people in the advertising industry want to see Snapchat succeed. A successful Snapchat serves as competition to the digital duopoly that is Google and Facebook.  The7Stars' Dear said: "Overall, it's positive to have multiple platforms forcing each other to improve. Whether it's [measurement] reporting, being more transparent, including Moat reporting — I feel if they weren't all challenging for the same budget, there wouldn't have been such a push towards things like transparency." To keep winning those budgets, Snapchat needs to stay on the front foot so that even if competitors do mimic its products — or if a new upstart launches — it has enough new features to keep users and advertisers coming back. Arguably, it's a challenge that every ad-funded consumer business faces. But with Snap Inc. becoming a public company this year, whether it can meet that challenge will soon be laid bare for all to see.  SEE ALSO: Snapchat is reportedly seeking $200 million commitments from ad agencies — here's what that means for its IPO NOW READ: How Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitter count a video view NOW WATCH: Watch Budweiser’s Super Bowl ad — it makes a strong statement on immigration Loading video...

Google Silently Fixes Pixel and Pixel XL Audio Distortion Issue GO The fix was included in the February security update Feb 8, 2017 14:20 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google can finally say that it has put the Pixel and Pixel XL audio issue behind it, after the company released a fix included in yesterday’s February security update. Google didn’t say too much about the fix, only that it resolves 36 issues, some critical. A little bit of context is in order. In December last year, Reddit user Mark Buckman exchanged four Pixel XL models after an audio issue persisted on all of them and on his wife’s Pixel. The issue caused an audio distortion on the two phones when the volume was set at one of the three highest levels. The user later found a fix, but it involved flashing a custom ROM on the phone, which might not be at hand for other Pixel owners. Later, Google admitted that this was a hardware issue and offered the user who discovered the issue a full refund with the return of his Pixel XL phone. However, there was a leaked email in which Google claimed that this wasn’t a hardware issue, but a software-related one and that a fix would be provided in a future update. Audio distortion issue finally fixed In any case, the latest security patch seems to have solved the issue, but oddly enough, Google didn’t make an official announcement. The fix isn’t mentioned in the changelog, which means that it might roll out gradually to users. It’s difficult to say at this point if the issue will be fixed on all Pixel smartphones, but we tested our Pixel XL with the latest security patch and found that the audio distortion was in fact gone. Play Video The best way to test your Pixel or Pixel XL phone is to get the Perfect Piano app, which Mark Buckman used for finding the bug. Set the volume at the highest level and tap your finger on the screen to test the audio. The February security patch started rolling out yesterday, but the availability depends on country and carrier. #Google#Pixel#Pixel XL#Audio distortion bug#February security patch subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Releases February Security Update for Pixel and Nexus Devices Google Now Launcher to Be Discontinued by the End of March Google Could Soon Cease Production of Pixel/Pixel XL Smartphones - Updated Google Assistant to Make Its Way to Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X Soon Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One    Google Pixel and Pixel XL New Android APKs HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

After more than doubling revenue, Duo Security looks ‘Beyond’ the firewall Posted Feb 8, 2017 by Ryan Lawler (@ryanlawler) 0 SHARES Next Story Pokémon GO’s Valentine’s Event brings SIX HOUR lures and makes a few super rare Pokémon show up more Few tech categories are growing faster than cybersecurity market, as organizations of all shapes and sizes seek to keep out their data out of the hands of increasingly sophisticated hackers. To help them face that threat, Duo Security is releasing a new suite of products based on a security framework developed by Google. Founded in 2010, Duo Security largely got its start securing companies’ internal and external apps via two-factor authentication. Since then, Duo has added new verification methods and additional means of securing client applications, whether they were delivered on-premises or through the cloud. Over the past several years Duo has seen huge demand for its products, which has driven annual recurring revenue to increase 135 percent over the past year, to $73 million for 2016. That marks the fourth year in a row that it had more than doubled revenue, and Duo’s founders say the company was cash-flow positive for the first time in the six years since it was founded. With offices in Ann Arbor, Mich.; San Mateo, Calif.; Austin, Texas; and London, the company has won the trust of 8,000 paying customers, including the likes of Facebook, Etsy, Yelp, and NASA. To serve those customers better, the company today is announcing its biggest release yet  — Duo Beyond — which is basically a commercial implementation of Google’s BeyondCorp framework. By doing so, Duo hopes to enable its customers to protect their networks and applications with the same type of security Google has deployed for its own internal applications and services. Duo has benefitted from the general acknowledgment by organizations of all stripes that “cybersecurity has become the biggest geopolitical problem of our time,”as Duo CEO Dug Song puts it. But whether we’re talking about the Sony hack or the DNC hack, it’s become clear that security today is less about fortifying the perimeter of the corporate network and more about ensuring that a person trying to access an organization’s data is who she says she is. According to Duo CTO Jon Oberheide, attackers have realized that going after end users and their access is the best way to breach network security.  Google began developing the BeyondCorp framework in the wake of the Operation Aurora cyber attack, which targeted the search giant as well as about dozens of other organizations. Using malware that originated on end user machines, the attackers were able to burrow within corporate intranets and probe for additional network vulnerabilities. Google’s response was to build a framework for security based on a perimeter-less architecture that focuses instead on device and user authentication. Duo’s adoption of that framework is designed to allow customers to replace existing VPN and network access control systems. That approach fits well with what Duo had already been doing, but the founders hope the Beyond offering will build upon its already robust Duo Platform business. Duo has raised $48 million from investors that include Redpoint Ventures, Benchmark, GV, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and Resonant Venture Partners. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Duo Security Founded 2010 Overview Duo Security is a cloud-based access security provider protecting the world’s fastest-growing and largest companies and thousands of organizations worldwide, including Box, Etsy, Facebook, K-Swiss, The Men’s Wearhouse, NASA, Palantir, Paramount Pictures, Random House, Toyota, TripAdvisor, Twitter, Yelp, Zillow, and more.

SUBSCRIBE Google makes it easier to see and share publishers’ real URLs from AMP pages New anchor button enables copy-and-paste of URLs directly to publisher sites. Danny Sullivan on February 6, 2017 at 2:00 pm More As promised, Google is making a change to how it displays Accelerated Mobile Pages, so that users can easily view and share links that lead directly to publishers’ sites rather than to Google’s copy of the content. Google has been displaying AMP content by effectively making a copy of it and rendering it from its own servers, something that Google says makes AMP both faster and more secure for users. However, this has raised concerns with publishers and some users, who have found the system difficult for reaching content directly on a publisher’s site. AMP & Google URLs For example, consider the situation below that existed before today’s announced change: The example shows an article from our Marketing Land sibling site, published and displayed by Google in AMP format. Despite it being from Marketing Land, the URL area of the browser shows it being part of Google.com. That means those who copied and pasted the URL to share via a tweet, through Facebook or some other way were sharing Google’s URL, not the actual Marketing Land address. In the end, it made no real difference. Google AMP URLs, when shared outside of Google, just redirect back to publishers. But that depends on Google maintaining the system that way. For many publishers, it’s just safer and more dependable to have people sharing their own direct URLs. Google surfacing direct URLs Google’s change allows this. Now, the URL field of a browser will continue to show a Google URL. However, the AMP header area will display a link or chain icon, what it calls the “anchor” button. Clicking on this will make the publisher’s direct URL appear, so that it can be easily copied and pasted: For those who hold down on the anchor button, Google says it will trigger the native share feature of the browser being used. With Safari, that means easy access to things like Twitter or Facebook. With Chrome, it lacks native share, so nothing should happen. Next to the anchor button, the three dots that Google calls the “overflow” icon brings up help information about how AMP is displayed. For those using Google’s search app on iOS, native sharing is already enabled. Google says that those using Google search through its app or native features on Android will get URL sharing features in the coming weeks. Google also said that it’s looking at ways to use the Web Share API so that the AMP header can offer sharing directly, if publishers make use of it. Whether this is enough to please some publishers will remain to be seen. It depends largely on users recognizing what the new anchor button is intended for. Those who keep copying and pasting from the address bar will continue to get Google URLs. For more about Google’s stated reasons for making copies of AMP pages to improve security and speed, see our previous article or see Google’s blog post today on the Google Developers Blog, which goes into depth on the subject.

português suomeksi svenska A Look at the Global Evolution of Direct Carrier Billing News provided by NetworkNewsWire Feb 08, 2017, 08:30 ET Share this article NEW YORK, February 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- According to a recent report in Android Headlines1, the long-awaited alliance between Google and India's largest mobile carrier, Bharti Airtel, to offer Direct Carrier Billing (DCB) has finally come to pass. On the table since at least 2014, the deal would give Airtel's nearly 40 million data subscribers the ability to purchase apps and digital content from the Google Play Store without having to submit banking information. This collaboration shows that DCB has come into its own. It won't be long before Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), First Data Corp (NYSE: FDC), Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ), PayPal, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), Net Element (NASDAQ: NETE) and other DCB outfits find they are on the right bandwagon. Google has inked a similar deal for the Indian market with British carrier Vodafone, suggesting DCB is on the cusp of rapid widespread acceptance. It's worth noting that the payment trend is taking root among smaller players, as well as industry behemoths like Google. One such example is global technology company Net Element (NETE). Ranked as one of South Florida Business Journal's Top 25 Fastest-Growing Technology Companies, Net Element specializes in mobile payments and value-added transactional services. The company has oriented itself for growth in emerging economies and the U.S., actively seeking opportunities to transform the online and mobile experience with a multi-channel platform, simplified security and compliance, essentially providing an all-in-one digital solution. Aligned with this growth strategy, Net Element offers DCB through its Digital Provider subsidiary. As one of several companies under the Net Element brand, Digital Provider works with the largest mobile operators in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as select emerging markets, to offer content providers, social media networks, game developers and other merchants a broad array of payment options, including DCB. What Net Element has discovered is consumer appeal of DCB - which is that it gives a mobile subscriber the convenient ability to purchase content such as apps, games and music and, rather than make a separate transaction, have the charge put on his or her telephone bill. Unlike making purchases with debit and credit cards, DCB does not require banking information. With DCB, a mobile provider supplies the third-party provider with just enough details to enable shipment of the content. The mobile provider pays the third party for the content and then sends the customer the bill at the end of the month. It's no accident that Google has chosen to expand its partnerships in India, where mobile phones far outstrip bank accounts. According to a global market report by Fortumo, called Direct Carrier Billing in 2016, Asia Pacific is set to overtake Latin America as the region with the largest transaction volume in carrier billing in 2017. DCB volume in India grew by 175 percent in 2016 with a potential for further triple-digit expansion. With a population of 1.3 billion, the country has an estimated one billion mobile phone subscribers. However, smartphone penetration is just 20 percent. As Indians replace their old mobiles with smartphones, DCB is likely to become a major payment method. The Fortumo report also highlights the Philippines and Australia, which together with India are the countries with the top growth markets in the Asia Pacific region. At present, mobile phone billing, as the folks at Apple (AAPL) call DCB, is available to customers of its iTunes Store, App Store and iBooks Store who live in Belgium, Germany, Japan, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. It's worth noting that the United States isn't on the list. For the most part, Net Element is among the first businesses in the United States to offer DCB services, though companies like First Data Corp. could awaken to the opportunity and follow suit. First Data (FDC) is a global payment technology company best known for its STAR inter-bank network. The company reportedly handles 45% of all U.S. credit and debit card transactions, but expansion there has been slow. First Data (FDC) is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on February 13. San Francisco-based Square, Inc. (SQ) - creator of the Square Reader that attaches to mobile phones and allows consumers to use debit and credit cards, as well as the Square Register point-of-sale software that can be used in lieu of traditional card terminals and cash registers - is also evolving the broader digital payment landscape. The company recently announced (http://nnw.fm/lMw7q) "a limited-time program that will allow small businesses to process more than $12,000 in Apple Pay payments for free (a $350 value) as an incentive for them to encourage their customers to use the payment method." PayPal (PYPL) is also moving the scale toward DCB in the United States. Back in 2012 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the company announced its plans to work with carriers and digital merchants to expand carrier payments. Today the company offers its Tele2 product, enabling subscribers to "top-up" their PayPal balances through their mobile phone bills - meaning the users can transfer money from their bank accounts into their PayPal (PYPL) accounts. Fortumo forecasts that, while Latin America boasts the biggest transaction volume for carrier billing, Asia Pacific is likely to take the leading spot in 2017. Perhaps one snag for DCB in the United States is consumer concern over data security. However, as an increasing number of consumers abroad take advantage of the conveniences of DCB, the market on American soil is ripe for companies like Net Element (NETE) to take a leading start.

Fill out our form. Or, use #AskAnSEO on social media. We took over a site, and after running the site through Screaming Frog, we noticed the previous [SEO] company was putting their company name way in the back of the title tag of every page. It was never seen on the SERP. As we took a look at more of their clients and it seems they were doing it to every client they had. What’s up with that? Does that really work? – Rick L., New York, New York Well there’s no nice way to say it… that’s just stupid. Really. Their company name has no relevance whatsoever to their clients’ name. There’s no way Google will ever find their client’s site relevant for the agency’s name. And in the Title tag? So that what, Google would think every page on every client site they’ve ever touched is equally relevant to their brand name? If anything, that stunt hurts their own rankings and the rankings for their clients. More likely Google recognizes how incredibly stupid this is and just ignores it. I find it shameful that an agency with so little knowledge of how search engines work is actually in business. We are facing issue with indexing in google search engine for [our] NEWS website: 1. When every, new URL of [our website] is fetched in google webmaster, it is taking nearly 24 hours to index in Google Search Engine(GSE). Also there is no crawl delay mentioned in robots.txt or in GWT. 2. Pls help me to check whether website is HIT by any google algorithms.  We are real facing indexing problems in GSE. Note: Website is Drupal based CMS. Normally URL fetched in GWT for indexing take minimum 1hrs to 15hrs or lesser then or greater than this. – Manisha A., Bengaluru, Karnataka Before I answer this question, I think it’s important to define Google News. It’s a separate entity from the main Google search index, and you have to apply to be a part of it. I checked the site you provided in your question, and it is not a member of Google News. Now your primary question is whether you have been hit by any Google algorithm. While I can’t say for certain because I can’t see into the deep recesses of Google, I am fairly confident that you are not dealing with any sort of algorithmic penalty. If the only problem you are seeing is that your pages are not being indexed as quickly as you would like, there’s no penalty or algorithmic negativity in effect, because that’s not how the penalties work. I’ve never heard of indexing being impacted in that way. If, as you say, your new pages are being indexed within 15 hours, this is actually quite quick for a site that is not officially part of Google News. Some things that can help speed up indexing include: Maintaining constantly updated xml sitemaps that are submitted to Google instantly when pages are added or changed, and being certain to specify an accurate Last Modified date/time in the sitemaps. Ensuring that you are delivering pages very very fast, so that there is no delay when Google is crawling your site. Not having a crawl delay is one thing, but if your site is not responding in under 3 seconds, you have very little chance of getting re-crawled within minutes or even hours. Make certain that your site is responding just as quickly on mobile as it does on desktop. Google will be moving to their mobile-first index any day now. These are things that will help you get indexed more quickly. However, you should note that a prerequisite for frequent crawling is to have content that is regularly updated, considered of great value, and considered to be highly time sensitive. Without those, a 24 hour crawl cycle is probably about as good as you’re going to get for now. Hi! Do sticky sidebar banners/related posts/share buttons/other promotions etc. which actually don’t disturb people from reading post (ie. don’t overlap with content and hide some part of it) affect page ranking ? Does Google misunderstand such banners and detect them as something which disrupts the reading experience? Should sites avoid using them as much as possible even on desktops? What is the best layout for blog posts? Thank You! – Vahan P., Yerevan, Armenia In general, sidebars and other promotions won’t have an impact on your site. The efforts Google is making to penalize sites with intrusive ads are designed specifically around things that intrude on the user’s experience. But Google knows you have to make a living, and that many sites are monetized with ads. Ad Content on Page In my opinion, sites with one or two ads (or even three if they’re small) appearing on the side of the main content above the fold are going to be ok. What I think Google doesn’t want to see are sites where there are so many ads or the ads are so prominent that they interfere with the user reading the main content of the page. I recommend to my clients that they try to stay under 30% ads to 70% main content visually if possible, but this is a random number I made up just so clients have a guideline; it’s not officially sanctioned by Google. The other thing that Google representatives have stated publicly is that they don’t want confusing ads – if there’s any question about what is an ad and what is main content, you could have a problem as well. So label your ads as sponsored, make them unobtrusive, and you should be fine. Interstitials You didn’t ask about interstitials, but I’m going to mention it since this change to the algorithm went into effect on January 10.  If you are blocking users from main content with any kind of pop up, you could have a problem. If your pop up forces the person to click something like “no I’m not interested in saving money” or asks the user to download your app, you will have a problem, as these are two specific instances Google has warned against. The jury is still out on whether pop-ups like newsletter signup or coupon offers will be a problem, but my personal opinion is that they will not be, as long as they can be easily closed and they don’t cover the entire main content area. I’m still recommending to clients that they have these pop-ups either pop under or trigger based on user action on the page (scrolling for example). Supplemental Content Finally, you mentioned sidebars that have things like “related posts” in them. If the content is relevant to the page and not just some random links to another site or another topic that is unrelated, this is considered “Supplemental Content”, and it is a good thing. Google’s Quality Rater Guidelines have indicated that sites with good supplementary content are considered higher quality. Want to ask Jenny an SEO question for her bi-weekly column?

Name: Subject: Message: Android Pay description updated to add instructions on using Android Wear for payments Apps & Games Newsby Mitja Rutnik3 days ago 6 216 5 If today’s expected announcement hasn’t already tipped you off, you’ll soon be able to pay for goods and services by using Android Pay on your smartwatch. Google has updated the description of the Android Pay app on the Play Store to show us how to use the mobile payment service on Android Wear. As expected, the process is quite simple, as all you have to do is hold the watch next to the terminal until the transaction is approved. After its done, you’ll be able to view the details of the transaction on your smartwatch as well as check out previous purchases you have made by scrolling down. Of course, you’ll need an Android Wear smartwatch with an NFC chip in order to use Google’s mobile payment service. Luckily, one of them is expected to be announced today, along with Android Wear 2.0. Google has teamed up with LG and will take the wraps off two smartwatches called LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport. The latter is the one that will sport an NFC chip and will, therefore, allow you to pay for products and services with your wrist. More devices are expected at MWC 2017 in a couple of weeks. See also: Android Pay supported at 46 more banks including Fifth Third Bank 4 weeks ago Paying for goods with your smartwatch is nothing new, as Samsung has already enabled the feature on the Gear S3 (with Samsung Pay). It is nice to hear that Google is bringing its own mobile payment service to Android Wear watches though, which will appeal to a large number of smartwatch owners. However, it is worth mentioning that Android Pay is not available globally. The service is limited to a few countries including the US, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK.

The search giant claims that Google Cloud Search provides comprehensive search and proactive recommendations throughout the day to help its users. The Google Cloud Search assistant has been made available both as a Web and a mobile app and provides users with relevant information in the form of assist cards. "Assist cards are a new way to help you find the right information at the right time. Using Google's machine intelligence technology, these cards can help you prepare for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention," the company said in its blog post. The search giant says that the assist cards have been designed to be timely so that they enable you to get through your work routine more efficiently. As machine learning is being used, it gets better with time as it absorbs information. Google says it will be adding more assist cards to Cloud Search over time. "In addition to searching for information, you can also search for people listed in your company's directory. You'll see colleagues' contact details, plus events and files you have in common. You can even choose to send an email, make a call, or start a Hangout with just a tap," it added. As privacy is a big concern for businesses, Cloud Search goes by the sharing permissions and only those people who have access to a particular file will be able to search or see it. Google says that Cloud search will start rolling out globally for customers using the G Suite Business and Enterprise editions. The search giant has even said that in coming months, it will be adding integration with third-party applications to Cloud Search.
