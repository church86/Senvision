According to a filing from Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), the company's compensation committee attributed the generous pay to Pichai's promotion to CEO and "numerous successful product launches." Alphabet's stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time. Pichai's base pay was a mere $650,000. On top of that, he received a stock award for $198.7 million, reports CNN. Under Pichai's leadership and keen eye, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. And clearly, these efforts have started to pay off for the company. A seasoned Google executive, Pichai had taken over as CEO as part of a corporate restructuring in 2015, while Larry Page, Google's cofounder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella.

Most of the pay consisted of Alphabet stock that the company valued at $198.7 million in securities documents filed Friday. Alphabet gave the award to Pichai in January 2016, a few months after he succeeded Larry Page as Google's CEO. Pichai still reports to Page, a Google co-founder who is now Alphabet's CEO. Page limits his annual pay to $1 because he already has an estimated fortune of $41 billion. The stock that Pichai received will vest in quarterly increments through January 2020. The 44-year-old Pichai also received a $650,000 salary last year in addition to personal security services and air travel valued at $372,000. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By: PTI | Houston | Updated: April 29, 2017 11:26 AM Google CEO Sundar Pichai. (Reuters) Google’s 44-year-old India-born CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly $200 million in compensation last year, double the amount he got in 2015. Pichai received a salary of $650,000 last year, slightly less than the $652,500 he earned in 2015. But the long-time Google employee, who was named CEO during the company’s reorganisation in August 2015, received a stock award of $198.7 million in 2016, roughly double his 2015 stock award of  $99.8 million. The company’s compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai’s promotion to CEO and “numerous successful product launches”, the CNN reported. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder, and previous CEO shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware, and cloud computing, the report said. Also watch: In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice-controlled smart speaker. These efforts have started to pay off for the company. Google’s “other revenues”, a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet’s stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time, the report said. No Comments.

What We Use, 2017 Edition: The stuff Corbin can't live without Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 8:26am PDTApr 28, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 17 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Features What We Use Series Article Contents 1 Hardware 1.0.1 Phone: Google Pixel 1.0.2 Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 1.0.3 Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' 1.0.4 Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') 1.0.5 Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) 1.0.6 Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 1.0.7 Smart speaker: Google Home 1.0.8 Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE 1.0.9 Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 1.0.10 Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock 2 Software 2.0.1 Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) 2.0.2 Signal Spy (Android) 2.0.3 InputMapper (Windows) 2.0.4 Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) 3 Conclusion You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

It looks fantastic :) Corbin Davenport Gladly! http://www.ebay.com/itm/First-Order-Trooper-vinyl-decal-sticker-STAR-WARS-Force-Awakens-/171760424579 EcE Any particular reason your smartwatches stopped working? I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers.

Amazon just announced the Echo Look, a new camera and style assistant From Google Glass to the Apple Newton, a museum in Sweden is shining a spotlight on some of the tech sector’s biggest misses. The Museum of Failure as it’s known, has products from Apple, Sony, Kodak and Google, as well as several other makers, all of which struggled with consumers. The collection covers over sixty “failed products and services from around the world,” according to a description on the museum’s web page. Samuel West, the museum’s curator, advises companies on how to successfully innovate by learning from failure. “A lot of tech failures are because immature technology is launched [such as] Google Glass, Apple Newton,” West told Fox News in an email. A tech product can be marketed “before it actually works and way before it is useful,” he said. But that’s all part of ultimately coming up with a successful innovation. “Innovation always requires an acceptance of failure…if you’re afraid of failure, innovation is impossible,” West added. Here are some of the notable flops from the exhibition, due to open in June in Helsingborg, Sweden. More On: gadgets Crimes are being solved by witnesses without eyes or ears How a fitness tracker could save your life The days of cracked phone screens will soon be over Prison inmates might be getting free tablets for some reason Kodak DC40 digital camera Innovation doesn’t succeed if a company doesn’t embrace emerging business models. That happened with Kodak, an early leader in digital cameras and is probably one of the best examples of innovation that failed. The DC40, manufactured by Kodak, was also branded as the Apple QuickTake 100. (Yes, Apple sold a standalone camera once.) “[Kodak’s] failure was an inability to truly embrace the new business models [that] disruptive change opens up,” according to an annotation attached to the Museum’s DC40 exhibit. “Kodak created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and even understood that photos would be shared online.” What Kodak failed to do was realize that online photo sharing was a new business, “not just a way to expand the [photo] printing business,” according to the annotation. Google Glass Google’s attempt to make smart glasses the next big thing in personal gadgets failed because the technology “still didn’t have any useful applications,” West told Fox News. Privacy concerns, due to the potential for furtive video recording, were also its downfall. Nokia N-gageReuters Despite the failure with consumers, Google Glass has gone on to have somthing of a second life, resonating in the healthcare and medical professions. Nokia N-gage The combination phone and gaming device failed at both, especially when you tried to put it to your ear and use it as a phone. “Poor design and lack of games made it flop. Great idea, lousy implementation,” according to West. Orbitoclast Lobotomy This 1948 technology for performing lobotomies was supposed to make them quicker and easier than before. “The tool was a success but the lobotomy as treatment was a terrible failure,” West said. Harley-Davidson Perfume This was a “brand extension failure” according to West. Bikers were not impressed. Other notable failures include the Apple Newton, which suffered from poor handwriting recognition, questionable utility, and a high price. (Apple did go on to create the iPhone, however.) Another was the Twitter Peek, “the world’s first dedicated Twitter device,” as described on the product’s package. Gizmodo described it as being “so dumb it makes my brain hurt.” Last but not least was the Sony Betamax, one of the most oft-cited flops. “Sony refused to collaborate with other manufacturers, while JVC focused on building a collaborative ecosystem by licensing the VHS format,” according to an annotation attached to the Betamax exhibit. “The classic story of tech innovation failure demonstrates that technical excellence and being first to market is not enough.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under apple ,  gadgets ,  google glass ,  harley-davidson ,  inventions ,  museums ,  nokia ,  sweden ,  Tech ,  twitter Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jeff Bezos close to eclipsing Bill Gates as world's riches...

Not only is Google Maps very detailed and useful with turn-by-turn navigation services, traffic updates, and more, but it is also free and free of ads. This means that users can use the service without worrying that ads might pop up and get in the way. However that could change in the future, assuming that Google’s CEO’s words are anything to go by. Speaking to a Wall Street analyst who inquired about Google possibly turning Maps into a moneymaker, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai replied by saying, “I’m sure you have noticed changes in Google Maps with the last few months.” “If you open Google Maps, you’re traveling or out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more info about what you can do, places to eat and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there overtime as well.” Pichai wasn’t explicit about saying that ads will be coming, but some have interpreted his words to mean just that. Exactly how these ads might surface remains to be seen. It could come in the form of suggested locations that pop up when you are searching around the area, or maybe it could be similar to how Google is serving ads up in search results, but either way we’ll just have to wait and see, but hopefully if and when ads do come to Google Maps, it won’t be intrusive.

We are keen on travelling and looking for new places to have a cup of coffee, buy groceries or just hang out. However, sometimes we may get lost or just don’t know where to go and what is the shortest way to our destination. Luckily for us, we can always stay on track with help of the navigations app! But there occurs another issue. What are the best free navigation apps? Many developers all over the world have spent sleepless nights to create a navigation app that will perfectly match users’ expectations. You may think there is no difference which one to use since they all perform only one main function – helping users find the shortest and fastest way to their destination. However, it’s correct in general, but incorrect in particular. Each app has its own lineament and tries to fit users’ needs better than competitors do. How to choose the most convenient and useful one? Read on the 5 best Android navigation apps list by Stormotion team and find it out! Google Maps The app was exclusively created by Google over a decade ago and was officially launched in 2007. During this time, the company has never abandoned this project, constantly adjusting it to the users’ requests. Now Google Maps is the absolute leader among navigation apps for Android. It has the highest number of downloads – more than 1 billion! This popularity is completely tenable: the app has the user-friendly and intuitive interface, it’s quite accurate and easy to use. However, during the last years, Google Maps more often faces criticism. Why? Let’s take a look at the app’s advantages and disadvantages: Advantages Disadvantages GPS system of Google Maps provides users with the highly detailed information on driving options and traffic dynamics. Some users complain that the app sometimes is slow to load. The app is multifunctional – it helps to build driving routes as well as pedestrian and ones that include the use of public transport. Google Maps doesn’t gather the up-to-the-minute data on unusual conditions (like damaged by a bad weather roads or construction works). Google Maps allows users to download maps of particular areas (up to 120,000 square km) for offline access. Occasionally, the app faces the lack of accuracy and may lead you the wrong route that won’t take you to the destination. Waze Waze is the navigation app-phenomenon that shook the mobile market back at the beginning of the 2010s. The best confirmation of this statement is the fact that in 2013 Google bought Waze for $1.3 billion and integrated some of its functions into Google Maps. Why is it so notable? Because Waze is the most successful and popular community-driven app. It means the app gathers real-time data from open sources by analyzing Waze users’ behavior and their reports regarding traffic jams, accidents, road repairing and other circumstances that may cause troubles while you drive. Waze is also known for its add-ons, which make the driving process easier and more comfortable. For example, you can integrate your Facebook and Foursquare friends to Waze or get the latest information on gasoline prices along your route. So, what Waze users think about the app? Read on: Advantages Disadvantages It offers up-to-date and real-time data about traffic and routes from the drivers just like you. In the area with a little drivers’ activity, the app literally loses its meaning. App has a wide range of cool add-ons, and the most of them can be really helpful. In the area with a high drivers’ activity, the app may display too many icons and distract you from driving. Catchy, bright and fresh app’s design is another reason why many people prefer this app to other. Waze consumes a big amount of battery power as it works constantly (even when it’s not navigating you) and collects data from other drivers. Maps.Me Maps.Me is another example of a convenient and free navigation app. However, it’s quite different from Google Maps and Waze that we have already reviewed. The key idea behind Maps.Me is to provide users with offline navigation. After installing the app, you will be offered to download the map of your country or city and then use it whenever you want even without any mobile internet or wi-fi access. Moreover, there are some additional features available for Maps.Me users. For example, you can use “search” function or bookmark routes for the future trips. The app also has the utter list of places of interest, which is extremely helpful in the urban environment. However, such approach has its own pros and cons. Let’s take a look: Advantages Disadvantages Unlike many offline maps, the app is completely free. Since it offline map, it won’t provide you with real-time traffic information. Turn-by-turn directions are available just like the list of nearby places of interest (Wi-Fi spots, WC and others). Some users say the app works very slowly due to the big offline database. Maps.Me is suitable not only for drivers – along with the car routes app includes walking and cycling navigation. In the developing countries Maps.Me may perform poor detalization. Sygic GPS Navigation This navigation app for Android successfully combines online real-time tracking with the possibility to download maps for the offline usage as well. Moreover, Sygic app has several interesting features that divide this app from others and make it unique. For example, it provides drivers with information about lane traffics, speed limits, the cheapest gasoline in the area and parking spots. At first sight, Sygic seems like a perfect navigation app for drivers. Nevertheless, users also managed to find a few disadvantages. Check it out: Advantages Disadvantages Accurate address data (app’s navigation is based on Tom Tom map data, which is often utilized by emergency and governmental services). Some users complain the app works slowly in the offline mode. Almost perfect 3D navigation with a realistic view of buildings, hills and other surroundings is also one of well-known app’s features. Despite the app is free to download, so as to get the full experience you should pay for a range of additional features. Sygic app also has a helpful lane guidance feature that makes lane maneuvering safer than ever. Some features are also unavailable for the offline usage. Navigon Navigon positions itself as the field leader. The app is not free, however, developers promise to provide you with the comprehensive interface, precise navigation and a broad diversity of useful features. Navigon takes the best industry practices and combines them in one app. Just like Sygic app, it allows drivers to build routes in the real time and download maps for offline navigation. Despite the high prices, the app has a pretty big number of fans. Why do they prefer it among others? Let’s find out: Advantages Disadvantages Navigon offers good functionality, comprehensive searching process and accurate navigation. Navigon is one of the most expensive apps in its category (you can get unlimited access for 79,99 € if you live in Europe and for 59,99 € if you live in the North American region). The app allows you to download offline maps with marked places of interest on it. The app has a specific design, which sometimes may seem clunky and distract you from driving. Navigon app has several useful features (like choosing the most appropriate route out of suggested variants or convenient voice instructions). App’s data takes a great deal of your smartphone’s storage space and can discharge the battery quickly enough. Conclusion Finally, we have successfully reviewed 5 excellent navigation apps for Android users. As you could see, they are quite different and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. This diversity is exactly the reason why they managed to attract fans and remain popular for months and years. Stormotion team tried to choose the best examples from each category. Which one exactly you should choose depends on your requests, needed features, free (or not free) access to the internet and other factors. However, one thing is absolutely clear right now: by choosing one of mentioned above apps you will successfully reach your destination point!

Google’s developer preview aims to bring Google Assistant voice agent applications to Linux developers. The Google Assistant SDK is initially designed for prototyping voice agent technology on the Raspberry Pi 3 using Python and Raspbian Linux, but it works with most Linux distributions. The SDK lets developers add voice control, natural language understanding, and Google AI services to a variety of devices. Google Home The AI-infused Google Assistant voice agent emerged first on the Linux-based Google Home speaker, and spread to various Android platforms to offer AI voice interactions. Competitors include Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri. The SDK incorporates the Python version of the gRPC API, an open source remote procedure call (RPC) client. Since gPRC allows you to generate bindings to other platforms, developers could also extend the SDK to port to Windows and Mac platforms, as well as other programming languages including C/C++, Node.js, Java, and Ruby. Raspberry Pi 3 The Google Assistant SDK is free for prototyping use, but requires that you make a deal with Google for commercial deployment. Later this year, “commercial device makers will also be able to use the SDK across a wide range of hardware,” said Google. The SDK release appears to be linked in part to a survey that Google posted for Raspberry Pi developers in January asking them what kind of Google tools they would find most useful. In the survey announcement, Google said that it planned to bring its AI and machine learning technology to the Raspberry Pi in 2017. Deeplocal’s RPi-based, Google Assistant infused Mocktail Mixer (click images to enlarge) The SDK includes samples and documentation, including instructions on how to make a voice-enhanced Mocktail Mixer developed by Pittsburgh-based Deeplocal. Built around a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino board, the open source bartender device lets you order cocktails by voice command, and dispenses jokes with the drinks. The Google Assistant SDK lets you add similar Q&A chichat to other devices ranging from a robot to a smart mirror, says Google. Developers can call upon “Actions on Google” to extend the SDK with new commands. For example, an action could turn on an LED light or set a robot into motion. The voice agent can be summoned with the OK Google hotword or a physical red button made available by Google. Other SDK features include the ability to read transcribed text from user voice input, which can be used to provide additional device functionality. For example, you could scan for happy or sad keywords and change the mood lighting accordingly. Google is currently working on enhancing the SDK with hotword support and companion app integration, among other features, and has established a community development site. There has already been at least one open source project designed to run Google Assistant on a Raspberry Pi using IFTTT. There are many more RPi projects using Alexa. Amazon has a head start over Google, Microsoft, and Apple when it opened its Alexa SDK to device developers. Over the last year, there has been a growing number of smart home and other mostly Linux-based devices that have integrated Alexa voice agents. Google Assistant SDK overview   Further information The Google Assistant SDK developer preview is available for download, initially optimized for the Raspberry Pi. More information may be found in Google’s announcement announcement and on the Google Assistant SDK web page.   Related posts: Google seeks dev feedback for putting AI on Raspberry Pi Google releases Cloud Vision API with demo for Pi-based… Android Wear 2.0 debuts on two LG watches Open source AI voice interface mounts on dashboards Conexant voice board lets you summon Alexa from a Raspberry… How to add Alexa to your Raspberry Pi 3 gizmo Linux-based smart home hubs advance into AI RPi-friendly home automation kit adds voice recognition… Google's Nest buys Linux automation firm, adds five… Google posts Android Auto design guidelines (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Chrome will let you browse pages, obviously, but it's also loaded with hidden hacks that can essentially streamline your internet-browsing experience and digital life. From simple tricks that allow you to send emails from the omnibar (aka address bar) to extensions that you let save images to Pinterest without ever having to go to Pinterest.com, Chrome has everything you could possibly need or want. For instance, here's over 30 tips and tricks we use on a regular basis to get the most out of Chrome. We will update this piece over time with more handy tools and functions as we discover them. Let us know in the comments if you know of one worth including. YouTube TV is now live: What is it and how does it work? 7 best Google Home compatible devices you can buy today Google Home review: A better voice assistant than Amazon Echo? Google Chrome tips and tricks Sign in to Google Chrome This might sound super obvious, but you really should sign in to the Chrome browser before you even think about using it. Doing so will allow you to save and sync things like your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings to your Google Account. Then, you can access them on any device. You can learn more about how to sign in to Chrome on this FAQ page. Make your own profile If you have different Google accounts, like work and personal, you can use profiles to keep your bookmarks and settings separate. You can learn more about how to add a Chrome profile on this FAQ page. Browse in private or delete your history If you don’t want Chrome to save what you visit or download, you can always browse the web privately using Chrome's Incognito mode. You can also delete your history, cookies, and other information - all at once or just some from a specific period of time. Go here to learn more about Incognito mode, or go here to learn about how to delete your history in Chrome. Access Chrome's settings From Chrome, find the hamburger menu or icon with three vertical dots on the upper left, and then select Settings to access Chrome's full list of settings. Or just type chrome://settings/ in your omnibar. Learn basic keyboard commands There are tonnes of keyboard commands, but here are some worth remembering: Ctrl/Command + T opens a new tab Ctrl/Command + W closes your current tab Ctrl/Command + Shift + T opens your last tab Ctrl/Command + L highlights whatever’s in the omnibar Ctrl/Command + Tab moves you a tab to the right Ctrl/Command + Shift + Tab moves you a tab to the left Add a “guest browser” account If you want to let your friend use your laptop but still keep all your browsing info private from them, go to Chrome's settings, and then under People select Add a person. This will let them have their own browsing experience separate from yours. Use the Task Manager You can Chrome’s Task Manager to end memory-hungry pages or see what’s slowing your session down. Go to Chrome's hamburger menu on the left and then select More Tools. From there, click Task Manager. Manage Autofill settings Use your autofill settings to avoid manually entering your address or password or credit card information on a daily basis. Just to Chrome settings, then “Show advanced settings…”, and “Manage Autofill settings” under “Passwords and forms.” Search sites From the omnibar Ever want to search YouTube without going to to YouTube.com? If you go settings, you’ll see a “Manage search engines…” button under the “Search” section. Click it to see a list of sites you can search directly from the omnibar. Chrome will add these automatically, but you can also enter the URL for a site, such as Wikipedia. So, when you type a phrase in the omnibar and then hit tab, you'll go to whatever related Wiki article you wanted to find. This saves you an extra step, as you no longer have to go to a site’s homepage to find what you want. Search your personal Gmail from omnibar Go back to the “Manage search engines…” area, then scroll to the bottom to add a new search engine, and enter the following: “https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/#apps/%s”. This is Gmail’s search function. You can then make the keyword “gmail.com,” or “mail.google.com”, and from that point on, you can search your email. Do math equations from omnibar The omnibar is amazing. For instance, you can use it as a calculator. Enter 10 x 10 and it will tell you the value is 100. Try it out. It works with any equation too . Google search a phrase by highlighting it You can Google search a phrase directly from your current page by highlighting it. From there, right click or drag it to the omnibar. So, if you highlight the word 'dongles' on a page, and then select 'Look Up', you will effectively Google search the word 'dongles'. Pin a tab Google Chrome has a "Pin Tab" feature. If you're not familiar with it, just keep in mind that browser tabs spawn from left to right. The first tabs you open are located on the left - unless you start moving tabs around. As a result, you probably keep your most important tabs on the left. With that in mind, the Chrome browser offers the ability to lock some of your most-used tabs to the left of your browser and reduces the tabs to icon size so that you can squeeze many of your favourites in a small space. All you have to do is to right-click on a tab and select the "Pin Tab" option. View what you're allowing on certain pages Ever want to see how many cookies a page is deploying or what permissions you’ve given it? Just click the "i" icon or page button next to the URL in the omnibar to view site info including cookies and permissions. It’s also a handy way to allow the page to show popups. Use the “Bookmark Open Pages…” option If you want to save your current browsing session for future reference, press the up arrow, command, and D keys all at once (or right click, then select Bookmarks, and click Bookmark Open Pages). You can then save all your open pages in a new folder. This is handy if you’re researching a subject and want to save all the helpful information you’ve already found. You can also download an extension like OneTab to do the same thing. Reopen your recently closed tabs If you ex out of your window, you can pick up where you left off by going to History from the menu bar (or going to History under the settings on the left of the browser, which can look like a hamburger menu or three-vertical dot icon, and then go to your history. Look for the tabs under Recently Closed, and click it once you find it. You can also go into settings and select “Continue where you left off” under the “On startup” section to relaunch your browser as you left it. Save and edit bookmarks A quick way to manage your bookmarks is to type command+D to add a bookmark. You can also always right click on a page in the bookmarks bar to edit their titles. You can also go to Bookmarks>Bookmarks Manager from the Menu bar to manage all your saved sites and folders. Quickly switch between tabs Hit Control or Command + 1-9 while you're on the omnibar to quickly switch between tabs. Each number corresponds to a page's place in the tab tab above. So, on Mac, Command + 3 will open your third tab. Quickly close tabs Simply right-click on a tab and then select “Close Other Tabs” or “Close Tabs to the Right" to get rid of them fast. Set startup pages If you want Facebook or some other page to appear as soon as you open Chrome, you can set it to automatically launch those pages. Just go to settings, then click the “Set pages” option next to “Open a specific page or set of pages,” and enter the sites you wish to visit right away. Use Chrome as a text editor Instead of using some random note editor on your machine to take notes, use Chrome. Just enter "data:text/html, <html contenteditable>" into the omnibar, and then you can jot something down real quick. Play a game when offline If you try loading a page when you’re offline, and you’ll see a static little T-rex. Once you see it, hit the spacebar, and then it will turn into an endless side-scroller runner game. Drag multiple tabs at once Hold down the Control or Command key and click on all the tabs you want to move in order to move them as one. Use Chrome as a simple multimedia player Click on any multimedia file on your computer and then drag it directly into your Chrome browser window to look at it. Download files to desktop To quickly access a file you downloaded, automatically download it to your desktop. To change where files automatically download, go to settings, then click the Advanced Settings link, and select Downloads. There you can alter where files automatically download to (like desktop). Zoom in or out On a PC, you can zoom in or out on a page by pressing Control while rolling your scroll wheel up or down. You can then click Control-0 to return to the default. On a Mac, you can zoom in and out by pressing Command-plus or Command-minus. Command-0 will go back to default. Go up or down using key commands You can use the spacebar to scroll down on page, and you can scroll back up by pressing shift and the spacebar. Translate everything Chrome has built-in Google Translate, but if you just want to translate a select phrase or passage, install the official Google Translate extension. You can highlight any text and click the little Google Translate icon that sits in the top-right side of your browser screen Cast your screen Casting is baked into Chrome. Just right-click anywhere in Chrome to prompt a pop-up cast window. Or, click the hamburger in the top-right to prompt a pull-down menu and then choose Cast. Go here to learn more about casting from Chrome to your TV. Use a Chrome theme Sick of how Chrome looks? Download a theme from the Chrome store. Just click over to the Theme section and click to install. Compose an email in your omnibar You can write your email up in the omnibar on Chrome and send it from there. Just type “mailto:” followed by the recipients address into your omnibar. It’ll open up the Gmail compose window automatically. From there, you can write your email and hit send. Create desktop shortcuts You can turn a site into a desktop app to speedily access your favourite website. Just navigate to thewebsite, then click the wrench icon, and select “Tools”. From there, click on “Create application shortcuts.” Explore Chrome extensions To get the most out of Chrome, go to the Chrome Web Storevand explore its vast amounts of extensions and apps. The right extensions will improve your web experience. For instance, you can install the Pinterest one so you can directly pin any image you see to your account. Do a barrel roll Type "Do A Barrel Roll" into the omnibar and hit enter. :) Want to know more? Check out our Google hub for related articles.

How to customize Chrome's terrible New Tab page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:02am PDTApr 27, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 58 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares135 Applications News Article Contents 1 Removing suggested content 2 Removing recent downloads and offline pages 3 Removing recently-visited bookmarks 4 Show tabs from other devices 5 Turning on the condensed layout 6 Switching to the Chrome Home interface Back in Chrome 54, Google replaced Chrome for Android's New Tab page with a new design that prominently featured suggested content - much like Google Now's feed. To quote Douglas Adams, "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. If you're not a fan of Chrome's cluttered New Tab page, there are a few workarounds you can try to make it a bit more usable. You can even mix and match features to create a more personalized design. The below workarounds require enabling or disabling Chrome flags. To do this, navigate to "chrome://flags" (without the quotes), press the menu icon, select 'Find in page,' and type the name of the flag starting with the hashtag symbol. Removing suggested content Removing the suggested articles list is pretty simple. Find the #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Once you do that and re-open Chrome, the list will no longer appear on the New Tab page. Removing recent downloads and offline pages The New Tab page also shows recent file downloads by default, but this is fairly easy to remove as well. Find the #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Then make sure you re-launch Chrome, and it should be gone. In addition, pages you have saved for offline reading show up on the New Tab page. If you want, you can turn this off by disabling #enable-ntp-offline-page-download-suggestions. Removing recently-visited bookmarks By default, Chrome shows bookmarks you have recently visited on the New Tab page. This can also be turned off by disabling the #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions flag. Show tabs from other devices As you may know, Chrome syncs your open tabs across your devices, so you can easily pick up from where you left off. There is a hidden flag that adds a 'Tabs from other devices' section to the New Tab Page. The only catch is that suggested articles has to also be turned on, which is a bit of a bummer. To turn it on, make sure both #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions and #enable-ntp-foreign-sessions-suggestions are set to Enabled. Then, reopen Chrome, and your tabs from other devices should appear. Turning on the condensed layout If you do like the suggested content or other features on the page, you still might want to turn on the condensed New Tab page layout. This removes the large space at the top, where the Google logo normally sits, allowing for more content to be visible without scrolling.   Left: Condensed design disabled, Right: Condensed design enabled To turn on the condensed layout, simply enable the #ntp-condensed-layout flag and re-launch Chrome. This is already enabled by default in Chrome Dev, at least on my device, so it may come to Chrome stable in the near future. Switching to the Chrome Home interface Chrome is constantly changing, and there's already another revamp of the New Tab page interface in development. It's called Chrome Home, and it moves the address bar to the bottom of the screen. With this new layout, the New Tab page is accessible by swiping up from the address bar, and it includes navigation icons for Downloads, Bookmarks, and History.    This new design only works on Chrome Dev and Canary for now. To try it out, switch #enable-chrome-home and #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox to Enabled and re-open Chrome. There you have it - a few tips to make Chrome's New Tab page less awful.

George at this rate, They need an 'Of The Hour' section... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Switching what the Bixby button does was possible with an app, but the recent update removes this ability. Nerds go apoplectic with rage against Samsung. Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. No outrage yet. Corbin Davenport Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ An EXTRA button, i.e., a button other phones don't even have. Does Samsung have a good reason for locking it into Bixby? It's too early to tell. Shaun39 You should put a sarcasm tag at the end of your clueless comments. EcE An EXTRA button many people reportedly have been pressing accidentally more often than trying to use it. MadMartigan Bingo. They could at least have put it on the other side. As it is, 100% of the time I hit I am trying to turn the volume down. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You'll never admit it, but I guarantee you'd be complaining no matter where they put the button. MadMartigan I think you may be having some trouble reading for comprehension. I'll gladly admit it, as it has been my point all along. Not a fan of Bixby. Not a fan of the button placement. Wouldn't mind at least being able to remap it to make it at least marginally useful rather than just simply in the way. They put the button in a very bad place. Adding insult to injury - they have now disallowed making it at all useful to anyone not inexplicably fond of Bixby. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does. Also, if they put it on the right, I guarantee people would still complain about accidentally pressing it. In other words, you guys will complain about anything as long as it's Samsung. EcE The point you are missing, is the comment you are replying to: "Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change." Having that button which you could be able to disable if Samsung weren't dicks, is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people don't even have yet. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! The nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. EcE Because when someone found a way to change it's behavior, Samsung quickly blocked it. An extra hardware button is more annoying than a home page you can just ignore, period. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And you can use another browser. Nobody's forcing you to use Chrome. You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it. Or just buy a phone without an extra button. That'll show Samsung. Same difference. MadMartigan "You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it." Proof positive you just straight up refuse to understand that the placement is a problem for some people. "Just not pressing it" is not as simple as you seem to want to make it sound. I've accidentally launched it several times trying to lower the volume on the 8+ and I can only imagine it would be even worse on the S8. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Proof positive you're just a whiny baby. I've accidentally pressed the volume button many times when trying to press the power button, because my hand grabs both sides of the phone to get the leverage to press the power button. As much as it may amaze you to hear this, I survive this heart-rending inconvenience. MadMartigan God forbid anyone express an opinion that doesn't cast Samsung in the best possible light... /s MadMartigan ..and you nerd rage against anyone who thinks it might not be the best thing ever, can we talk about that, maybe? You know, since we're apparently not allowed to discuss the possibility that they might have handled it better? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You implied that the lack of complaints was because Chrome 58 is still rolling out. I pointed out that the nerd rage about the button occurred before people got their phones, thus nullifying your point. Discuss anything you want. MadMartigan Except any possibility that Samsung could have done something better. Apparently we're not allowed to do that without being called names... MadMartigan "If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does." So a bad key placement could not be made at least marginally better by allowing to map to something you might actually someday use... Got it. Your logic is flawless... /s Necdet Ali Özdür How come people don't press other buttons accidentally but​ somehow keep pressing Bixby button all the time? EcE Who said that? Necdet Ali Özdür ... you? EcE Oh yeah? I said: "Bixby is the only button people press accidentally" ... I'm sure I did. and btw, HTC's power button just below the volume buttons is/was (HTC 9/10 and whichever else they did the same) something to complain about as well. Either way, the point here is that having an extra button that cannot be disabled/remapped is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people have not seen yet. Necdet Ali Özdür That doesn't mean those people won't see it, I guess that's the point you are missing. Both decisions can be reversed by respective parties by means of a software update, but people (especially here in Android Police) complain about Samsung the most. EcE Nah, I think we enjoy bi+ching about everything Necdet Ali Özdür Who doesn't? 😂 MadMartigan Possibly due to it's bad placement. Have you been paying attention? Necdet Ali Özdür It's placed where a button could be placed on an all screen phone. Like the rest of them it's on the side. MadMartigan So there's no other place they could have put it? Really? I hope you're actually trying to be dense... Do phones you use not have tops, bottoms, or right sides? Do they have no room at all below where the button is currently placed on the left? Necdet Ali Özdür I hope that next phone you own will have a power button on the bottom and volume buttons on the top. Because those are valid positions to place buttons. Yeah. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It doesn't matter where the buttons are. If it's a Samsung phone, at least 75% of AP commenters will be outraged. MadMartigan ...and the one fanboy will attempt to shout down anyone with a valid opinion regarding how it could have been better. Because to him, Sammy can do no wrong. FWIW: I have not owned a Samsung since the S2 and as this was the first one without the ridiculous home button, I jumped at it. I like pretty much *everything* about the device other than the absurd Bixby-button. MadMartigan lmao. Are you being serious? HTC had power buttons on the top - never once accidentally powered it off. You really cannot accept that the placement may not be optimal for some people? That this is the only place they could have put it? Necdet Ali Özdür It's in a place where majority of current devices have their buttons. Sounds more optimal to me than the places you've suggested. Some people may not like to have it at that place, or not have that extra button at all. But in my opinion it is the best place to place Samsung could've put it. MadMartigan So the right side, where there is currently only one button, would be a worse place for it? They couldn't texture the power button and have the bixby button 1/2 inch below it? That wouldn't be better than the same texture as the volume keys, and right next to them? I mean heck, even if they'd just added a texture to it...that would have been better. Necdet Ali Özdür It is significantly smaller than the volume button (which is a rocker now) which makes it easy to differentiate with a finger. But yeah a texture wouldn't hurt. I agree you on this one. But if it was on the right side, I'm pretty sure people would still complain as much as they do now, claiming they're confusing it with the power button and such. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're complaining because it's a Samsung phone. If this was a button on the Pixel, it could be in the worst possible location and they'd go to the ends of the earth to defend it. MadMartigan Honestly, I would have loved it on the right, in a perfect location to be hit by the finger right above the pinky when needed. Power-index, Bixby two fingers down. Would have, IMO, been perfect. Could have even gone without the texture on that one. Where it is now, you're going after it with your thumb. Until muscle-memory kicks in, it's a crap-shoot where it's going to land initially and unless you expect to have to double-check, you're going in to press - and could easily press the wrong one. It's all personal preference, to be sure, but I do believe they could have appeased far more people by putting it on the right. FWIW - the same complain was leveled at HTC when they placed the power/volume buttons on the same side, though I do not believe the volume was a rocker on that model. Could have been done better. My favorite device was actually the One M7 - which had the power-button on the top. Power-top, volume-right, nothing on the left. Zero possibility of confusion. (Power on the back would have been fine as well - V20 nailed the fingerprint sensor/power on that one.) bekifft There is no good reason for locking hardware functionality away from the user. Don't give them a pass on taking more control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ As I say below, the nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. This isn't about timing. It's about Google love vs. Samsung hate. MadMartigan Wow. Someone's triggered... Tiuri Elvander I was and am still outraged. Have been since this came up in the review of 58 Beta Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, so far, that makes one of you, vs. the dozens of people who went into a nerd rage about the Bixby button, many of whom don't even have or want the phone. MJ I don't use Chrome a lot to care enough to disable the new tab page crap but why would Google stop users from customizing it? I can do that with Firefox... Address bar at the bottom of the screen? WTF? Michel Sa Address bar at the bottom makes a lot more sense on a mobile phone. Renan In a mobile phone, having the address bar at the bottom of the screen makes a lot of sense MJ No... ipsofact yes... MJ How have I been able to use the address bar on my phone at the top all this time? EcE Magic? ipsofact we never said you could not use the address bar on your phone. But on mobile its a lot quicker and pain free to have it at the bottom. Unless you want to stretch your thumb all the time. MJ Come on... Are you a human? When I hold my phone my thumb is already naturally pointing toward the top of my phone so would need to stretch it to make it to the bottom. Regardless, I happen to have nine other fingers and the on-screen keyboard pops up in the same place anyway. I have been using the address bar at the top of browsers for over 20 years now so don't need to be changing my workflow habits now and just on my phone on top of it. ipsofact typical ive been doing this for 20 years so I wont change the way I work. You know I work with several people with the same mentality.. I have been using the address bar at the top since day 1 but today I changed it to the bottom. Works great and believe me I won't let the old "ive been doing it like this for years" ever stop me. Or just put the phone upside down. it works ;) MJ Change is not the issue... It's change for no good reason or benefit. At least give the user control to change it back. Some unknown God(s) at Google one day just deciding the address bar will now go at the bottom is ridiculous. Microsoft tried that crap on a larger scale with Windows 8. How did that work out for them? ipsofact You can change it back and forth. Its up to the user to decide. So we are not being obligated to do anything. Just given options! :) Which I like. I can decide the whether the bar will go up the top or the bottom. MJ What? LOL The whole article is about Google not allowing users to disable the crap on new tabs. Thanks for your input and have a good day. MadMartigan "It's change for no good reason or benefit." Thankfully, your refusal to see the reason or benefit does not affect the ability of anyone else to. MadMartigan He said it made sense on the bottom - not that it wasn't unusable on the top. Reading is fundamental. FeelThePoveR It depends on the usage. Sometimes I press my hardware buttons accidentally when doing the swipe up gesture on the bottom adress bar in chrome (closing the tab/app or whatever). I'm still loving it though. MadMartigan People still use mobile Firefox?? ipsofact Firefox still use mobile people? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Except for Android and the Play Store (and their dependencies), I'm off all Google apps. I'm sick of the constant BS coming out of Google. I use Dolphin as my browser. If I get frustrated with Android enough, I'll just give up my precious S Pen and give an iPhone a chance. MadMartigan I loved that change and wish they'd bring it to desktop Chrome. Would love a "Google Now" start-page on the desktop. Kieron Quinn I've used iChrome as a Google Now-esque NTP for a while, it used to be a lot better (especially when it actually got Google Now cards via a hidden API) but is slowly getting worse: http://i.imgur.com/vfO7Kfq.png Lindajgomez My last paycheck was $22500 for working 12 hours a week online.Start earning $97/hour by working online from your home for few hours each day with GOOGLE...

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? M6 https://landing.google.com/sre/ Blake Thanks! This is really cool. I'm almost done with my CIS degree so this really interests me. Is this something that's mostly done at Google or a more wide ranging field? I guess I could just Google that lol M6 Similar in some ways to DevOps at other companies, but Google has its own unique take. Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. Nicholas Conrad People I think don't understand what Google Home is for. It's not an Assistant appliance, it's a good (admittedly not great) chromecast speaker at an entry-level price point. Assistant baked in is gravy, but not the primary use-case. It's basically only there for Google to farm Assistant interactions to jump-start their ML dataset. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house. papastevez Can't cast videos from google play movies yet either. ಠ_ಠ Follow Android Police 1.5M 466k 142k 112k Latest Deals 7 [Deal Alert] Ecobee3 thermostat is now just $176.16 at Amazon ($72 off) 2017/04/28 5:58pm PDTApr 28, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Get your weekend started with 18 temporarily free and 23 on-sale apps 2017/04/28 2:21pm PDTApr 28, 2017 33 [Update: G6 and Watch Style for $650] Pre-orders for the unlocked LG G6 are live on B&H for $599.99 2017/04/28 12:15pm PDTApr 28, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Bose QuietComfort 25 down 25% to $225 on Amazon and eBay 2017/04/27 5:19am PDTApr 27, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Get a Verizon/unlocked Galaxy S8 with warranty for just $699.99 ($56 off) from a reputable eBay seller 2017/04/26 3:46pm PDTApr 26, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

It’s the end of another busy week around the tech world, and there’s been no end of intriguing announcements, exciting rumors, and eye-opening insights. But don’t worry if you think you might have missed something, for 7 Days is here again to walk you through the week’s top tech news. Our journey begins this week in Canada, where Lyrebird announced its development of a speech synthesis API that promises to create a realistic, 'emotional' copy of anyone's voice after hearing them speak for just one minute, raising some interesting ethical issues. Meanwhile, AT&T announced upgrades to its 4G network - including improvements that some other carriers already made months ago - and branded them as "5G Evolution". That's nothing but a meaningless marketing term designed to 'wow' clueless consumers into believing that AT&T is technologically superior to its rivals - and the company was widely mocked for its foolish approach. Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, announced plans to eliminate Title II net neutrality rules for broadband connections in the US. A vote on the proposal will be held on May 18. uTorrent is the world's most popular BitTorrent client, and is currently distributed as a standalone application - but the next major version will run in users' default web browser, promising an improved user experience, and a broader range of features. The developers of popular media center app Kodi spoke up about the prospect of using "low-level DRM" to deter piracy. While the app is not designed to enable piracy, it has become a firm favorite among those who download copyrighted content without paying for it, thanks to its flexible, open source design. The European Court of Justice ruled this week that selling media player hardware with software configured to enable or facilitate piracy is now illegal. Music streaming service Spotify is preparing to build "a category defining product akin to Pebble Watch, Amazon Echo, and Snap Spectacles". Little is known about the device, which will be the company's first foray into hardware development. Amazon unveiled its latest hardware on Wednesday: the Echo Look, a virtual "style assistant" built into a camera-equipped device that will help you to choose the perfect outfits, and shop for new ones - on Amazon, of course. Facebook announced a huge expansion for the 'lightweight' version of its Messenger app, which it launched last year. Messenger Lite is now available in 132 new markets around the world. AMD revealed its latest professional-class workstation graphics card, the Radeon Pro Duo. Equipped with two Polaris-based GPUs, it promises a monstrous 11 teraflops of graphics processing power. Will 2017 finally be the year of Linux on the desktop? Well, it's probably not going to oust Windows anytime soon - but Ubuntu 17.10 is shaping up to be a major upgrade. Moving on - from Ubuntu, to Uber... It emerged this week that the global ride-sharing service had continued to track users' devices, even after they'd uninstalled its app. Given Uber's history of shady practices, this didn't exactly come as a great shock to many people, but the company insisted that it did not deliberately infringe users' privacy, and that the 'fingerprinting' technique it used was intended to prevent fraud. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly reprimanded Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick for violating the App Store's rules - but while few were surprised by Uber's actions, many people expressed their considerable disapproval over the fact that Uber faced no consequences for those actions, pointing out that smaller app developers would have been kicked off the store immediately. On Monday, Apple released its fourth wave of developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5 Sierra, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. A fifth developer beta for the latest version of iOS arrived on Thursday. Password management service provider LastPass said an issue with its two-factor authentication when using Google Authenticator has been fixed. According to researchers at Check Point, nearly two million devices may now be infected with malware from apps downloaded via the Google Play Store, the first of which was uploaded in November 2016. The frequency of Android security issues certainly strengthens BlackBerry's case for a 'hardened' version of Android 7.1 Nougat. TCL's latest BlackBerry handset, the KEYone, promises "unparalleled security", and after launching in London this week, it will go on sale in the US and Canada on May 31. The long, slow rollout of the latest Android OS updates has continued in recent days, reaching another handful of devices: Android 7.1.1 heads to Sony's Xperia XZ and Xperia X Performance T-Mobile announces upcoming Android 7.0 rollout for Galaxy Note5 Galaxy S6 and S6 edge get Android 7.0 in Canada, and on Verizon Android 7.0 now available for Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on US Cellular Samsung's Galaxy S8 flagships continued to make headlines this week: The always-on home button won't suffer from screen burn-in Pre-orders easily beat the Galaxy S7 Galaxy S8 is surprisingly expensive for Samsung to build An imperfect solution, but you can once again remap the Bixby button to other functions Samsung confirmed that it will "launch a new flagship phone in the second half" of this year, having previously said that it plans to offer "a better, safer, and very innovative [Galaxy] Note8". Like the disastrous Galaxy Note7, Samsung's new Galaxy S8 flagships feature the company's dual-curved displays, which wrap around the left and right edges of each device. But Samsung is now rumored to be working on a display that curves into all four edges of a handset, giving a screen-to-body ratio of 98%. You wouldn't want to drop that phone onto a sidewalk... Samsung worked closely with Qualcomm to develop the Snapdragon 835 chipset used in its Galaxy S8 and S8+. The two companies are now said to be working together on the next-gen 'Snapdragon 845' processor, destined for the Galaxy S9. Long before the S9 arrives, Google will release its second-generation Pixel handsets, at least one of which will apparently use the Snapdragon 835. LG launched its new G6 flagship in India, taking on the Galaxy S8 with lower prices and a substantial cashback offer. Chinese manufacturer Gionee revealed its new M6S Plus, featuring an upper-mid-range Snapdragon 653 processor, 6GB RAM, a 6-inch 1080p display, and a massive 6020mAh battery. ZTE's Max XL launched in the US on Boost Mobile, priced at $129.99. Running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, it has an octa-core Snapdragon processor, 2GB RAM, a 13MP camera, and a generously-sized 3,990mAh battery. Pretty decent specs for that price! T-Mobile will soon be launching the Coolpad Defiant in the US. The Android 7.0 handset will offer entry-level specs at a price that's likely to be under $100. Lenovo is reportedly preparing to shut down its ZUK Mobile business - but its spirit may well live on, as the company is said to be bringing its ZUI interface to some of its Moto devices. Japanese manufacturer NuAns said in February that it was ditching Windows 10 Mobile for its next handset, in favor of Android 7.1 Nougat. The Neo Reloaded looks similar to its Windows-based predecessor - including its stylish range of covers, in a combination of materials, such as denim, leather, stone and wood. The new Android handset has been available to pre-order in Japan for several weeks, but NuAns is now offering it internationally through a crowdfunding campaign, priced from $355. Microsoft updated the beta version of its Arrow Launcher for Android devices, adding a wide range of new features, including Android for Work support. Vizio revealed its new range of XLED TVs, priced from $799.99 for the 50-inch M-series model, up to $3,499.99 for the 75-inch P-series. The new TVs include voice support through the Google Assistant. It also announced new soundbars, starting from just $79, and a $199 wireless speaker. HP described its new DreamColor professional displays as "game-changing" - but you'll need deep pockets to afford the $3,999 31-inch 4K model. Acer announced its new gaming monitors and notebooks, including a Predator gaming Ultrabook, which features an odd placement for the keyboard, in order to accommodate a transparent glass trackpad. Acer also debuted its latest range of more 'conventional' Windows 10 devices, including notebooks and 2-in-1s. Acer said that it will launch new Windows Mixed Reality headsets "later this year" for consumers and businesses. My colleague, Rich Woods (yep, that's him grinning above), had the opportunity to try out the company's Development Edition headset - check out his impressions of the head-mounted display here. Microsoft released new firmware for its Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 - but only for those machines running its latest Windows 10 Creators Update. The company also launched a 'graduation sale' offering discounts on a wide range of products, including up to $150 off the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft published its latest quarterly earnings report on Thursday, revealing a chunky 26% drop in Surface revenue - hardly surprising, given that its Surface devices are now 18 months old, and completely outclassed by newer Windows 10 machines. As in previous quarters, Microsoft's greatest successes came from its Cloud and Office businesses, helping it to bring in $5.7 billion in net income on revenue of $23.6 billion. There was healthy growth in its Windows business too. But, unsurprisingly, it was another catastrophic quarter for Microsoft's Windows phone business. It brought in just $5 million (yes, million - that's not a typo) in phone hardware revenue during the entire quarter, compared with $1.4 billion during the same quarter two years ago. Microsoft maintains that its phone platform is "alive and well", because it's still shipping Windows 10 Mobile builds - but it's rolling those builds out to a tiny number of devices, and its work on the OS has now been separated from the main Windows 10 Development Branch. On Wednesday, Microsoft began rolling out the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update - but just 13 handsets are officially supported. The update brings a handful of new features and improvements, but major additions that were previously promised did not make it into the update. Older handsets can still get the Creators Update via the Windows Insider Program, but Microsoft has made it absolutely clear that it will be offering no support or assistance for those devices, so if you get in trouble, you're on your own. The latest data from AdDuplex, published this week, revealed that almost 61% of Windows 10 Mobile devices are eligible to upgrade to the Creators Update, but that still leaves a huge proportion of handsets unsupported, in addition to all of the Windows Phone 8.1 devices that Microsoft made little effort to upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, even though they were previously eligible. On Friday, Microsoft released its latest Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15208 to the Fast ring. As with its other recent Mobile builds, that one is from the 'feature2' Development Branch, rather than Redstone 3. It also rolled out Windows 10 preview build 16184 to PCs in the Fast ring - and yes, that is a Redstone 3 build, and it includes support for a major new feature: the My People communications experience that was originally due to arrive as part of the Creators Update. The fixes and known issues for that new PC build can be found here. Additionally, Windows 10 build 15063.250 made its way to PCs that have upgraded to the Creators Update, but which aren't on the Insider Program. Microsoft discontinued its Band 2 wearable device last year, but it's now supporting its hardware partners in bringing their own devices to market. On Monday, it revealed a new wearable on the way from German manufacturer TrekStor, running Windows 10 IoT Core. Microsoft is working with audio equipment specialist Harman Kardon on a new smart speaker, the 'Invoke', which will use its Cortana digital assistant. An update to the Cortana app on Android revealed that the Invoke will support Spotify, and numerous other music services. We've known for a while that Microsoft is planning to bring its full Office 2016 desktop applications to the Windows Store. Listings for those applications have already appeared in the Store, under some rather delicious codenames. A flaw in Microsoft Word was able to be exploited by hackers for several months, while the company continued to investigate it. Microsoft upgraded its Azure Media Player this week, with accessibility improvements, new plug-ins, a fresh skin, and more. It also introduced a new 'Billing Reader' role to its cloud platform, as well as adding a new Invoice API. LinkedIn passed a major milestone, reaching over 500 million members - an increase of 67 million in the last twelve months. Microsoft, which acquired LinkedIn last year for $26.2 billion, announced its plans to integrate the professional networking platform with Dynamics 365. Microsoft's Xbox platform also celebrated a big milestone, with over 500 ID@Xbox games now available on Windows 10 and Xbox One. The Xbox Insider Beta Ring got its first preview of the Version 1705 update on Friday, while the Alpha Ring received the very latest preview release, build 15063.3033, a day earlier. It was an exciting week for the Xbox One Backward Compatibility program, with three more Xbox 360 titles added on Tuesday, followed by another six on Thursday, including Dead Space 2 and 3. Perhaps the biggest gaming news of the week came from Activision, which released the first official trailer for Call of Duty: WWII. It looks absolutely incredible - like many other gamers, I can only hope it's worth the long wait... Battlefield 1 got a substantial update, adding new platoons, more weapons, and numerous other improvements. Here's a blast from the past: if you're old enough to remember the original Tomb Raider, you can relive those good times with a new browser-based version of the 1996 game, with unlocked FPS. Looking ahead, Capcom revealed new details about its upcoming game, Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. The legendary fighting series will shake things up a bit for its 2017 release, introducing a 2-vs-2 format, Infinity Stones, and more. Nintendo revealed that it sold 2.74 million Switch consoles in its first month, and it expects sales to total at least 13 million by April 2018 - potentially matching, or even exceeding, lifetime sales of its older Wii U. Nintendo also announced its latest handheld console, the 2DS XL, featuring larger displays than its predecessor. The older 2DS will remain on sale, but the new model will cost almost twice as much. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week in the fast lane, as Microsoft announced the upcoming launch of a new Hot Wheels expansion pack for its Xbox One exclusive motorsport game, Forza Horizon 3. I can't wait! Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Boyd Chan published his detailed review of the NOMU S30, a rugged Android smartphone that offers IP68 dust- and water-resistance, a very large 5000mAh battery, and plenty of storage, at a surprisingly decent price. It's not a perfect handset, but it's pretty good! And Timi Cantisano got his game on, as he reviewed Mr Shifty on the Nintendo Switch. He found it to be surprisingly good fun, if a little silly in places, and the graphics left a lot to be desired. But if you're on the lookout for an enjoyable title on Nintendo's compact console, make sure you check out that review.

Google indeed did launch their own take in the form of the Google Home, but Apple’s version has yet to surface. We have heard that the company is close to finalizing a design, and now more details have surfaced. In a tweet by Mashable’s Jen Ryall, she shares additional details about Apple’s Echo competitor that were provided by Sonny Dickson. According to those details, Apple’s Echo competitor is expected to feature a design that is in the style of the Mac Pro. Chances are it won’t be quite as big or look exactly the same, but there will apparently be some stylistic similarities. More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor: – Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 It will sport a concave top with controls, a speaker mesh portion covering it all that is similar to the UE Boom’s mesh, and that it will most likely be launched at WWDC 2017 which kicks off this coming June. We know that Apple has used WWDC to launch new products before so it wouldn’t really be surprising to see them do it again. We can only assume that it will be powered by Siri, and since it is WWDC, perhaps Apple could even announce and share plans on how developers could potentially help to create “skills” for the device like what is being done with Amazon’s Alexa, but until then take it with a grain of salt.

That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay -- a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud. He oversaw a 17.8 percent jump in Google’s core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai’s 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job. The award was granted about six months after the tech business announced it would reorganize into holding company Alphabet. As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity.© Anders Melin and Mark Bergen BC-GOOGLE-CEO-PAY It wasn’t the first time following in Page’s footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice president of products and took over many of Page’s responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid U.S. executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn’t required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don’t reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn’t disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The Mountain View, California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said “encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business.” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat got a $39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019. © Anders Melin and Mark Bergen BC-GOOGLE-CEO-PAY Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The Math Missus (aka Sarah Smellie) gets a lesson in AI from Google-guy Nithum Thain By Sarah Smellie, CBC News Posted: Apr 28, 2017 10:00 PM NT Last Updated: Apr 28, 2017 10:00 PM NT Nithum Thain is a researcher for Google technology incubator Jigsaw. (Sherry Vivian/CBC) Related Stories The Math Missus: Gaming the game shows The Math Missus: are you a math person? When it comes to understanding artificial intelligence, we have a unique advantage here in St. John's. We have Nithum Thain. Thain is a research fellow at Jigsaw, a tech incubator launched by Google and owned by Alphabet, Google's parent company. Jigsaw's aim is to battle threats to human rights and free speech using technology. Its projects include a Google Chrome extension which alerts users when sites are trying to lift their passwords. It was originally developed to protect Syrian activists from hackers. Thain works remotely for Jigsaw from St. John's, looking at how artificial intelligence could help solve the problem of online abuse. In particular, he's been using AI to study patterns of abuse among Wikipedia editors. We caught up with Thain at Common Ground Coworking and asked him to help us understand what artificial intelligence is. We also asked him if there really is anything to fear — if it's really possible that artificially intelligent robots could somehow overthrow us and take over the world. It was supposed to be a joke. But ... his answer isn't "No." Are today's intelligence chatbots leading a future of terrifying Terminators? Is this your first lesson from The Math Missus? Here's your chance to catch up on the series! In Part 1, the Math Missus dispels the notion of a "math person". In Part 2, we show you how to game the TV game shows by understanding the math that underlies popular games like Plinko and Let's Make a Deal.

Photo / AP The NBA playoffs are currently in full swing, with the best basketballers in the world battling in the first round. Well, most of the best basketballers in the world. The (self-proclaimed) best player in the world is, like the rest of us, watching on from the sidelines. And that's an altogether positive thing, both for the opposition, who are fortunate to avoid him, and for the rest of us, who are treated to the following. In a piece he wrote for the Players' Tribune website - rather amusingly titled "The NBA Is Lucky I'm Home Doing Damn Articles" - Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters revealed the brash man behind the brash player. It's an intriguing insight into the arrogance required to reach the top, an attribute hidden by most athletes behind a facade of faux modesty. It's hilarious throughout and heartfelt in places, and begins with a wonderful story about Waiters being underestimated his whole life. "I had just transferred over to South Philly High, and I was walking to class the first day when these two security guards came over to me," Waiters writes. "The one guard was like, 'Hey! Young boy! Hey!' They're questioning me, like, 'Hey, what're you doing here? "So I pull the basketball roster out of my pocket, and I say, 'I'm Dion Waiters. I just transferred.' The guard says, 'Never heard of you.' So I say, 'Man, I'm committed to [play college basketball at] Syracuse!' The other guard starts cracking up. He goes, 'Son, you're not committed to Syracuse.' "They're looking me up and down, like, Nah, you ain't sh**. So I say, 'For real! Google me!' Now they're laughing their asses off, right? The one guard goes, 'Ain't that some sh**? Google me! I am gonna Google this kid, too.' So they take me down to the office, and they Google me. "Maxpreps.com. Dion Waiters. Committed to Syracuse. The guard goes, 'Man, you weren't lying!' I'm looking at him like, uh-huh. From that day on, every time I saw that guard in the hallway, he'd yell out, 'What's up, Google Me?'" Continued below. Related Content Basketball: Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards advance in NBA playoffs Heather du Plessis-Allan: Andrew Little bit more likely Diana Clement: How to avoid an expensive insurance accident That was an appropriate nickname, given Waiters would rise to the NBA and become something of an internet star, beloved on social media for appearing to have far more faith in his own abilities than a player of his talent has any right to possess. "I'm not a big internet guy, but I see things," he wrote. "I see what people say about me. They say, 'He never seen a shot he don't like', 'He's got irrational confidence', 'He thinks he's the best player in the NBA'. "Hell yeah I do. I have to. Picture yourself walking into a South Philly playground at 12 years old, with grown-ass men, bleachers packed with people, trying to get a run in. "You think you can survive in Philly without irrational confidence? You will never in your life hear the words, 'I can't' come out of Dion Waiters' mouth. I can. I will. I already did." A true Gift for African baseball If coming out of the mean streets of Philadelphia was hard, it's nothing compared with the journey just completed by the delightfully-named Gift Ngoepe. The Pittsburgh Pirates infielder this week became the first African-born player to appear in Major League Baseball and, in his very first at-bat, became the first African to get a hit in an MLB game. Ngoepe grew up in South Africa, a country not exactly known for its baseball pedigree, and fell in love with the sport the way many of us have all around the world: by watching the Yankees play the Red Sox. "Me and my best friend at the time, he liked the Yankees for some reason and I knew there were huge rivalries with Boston so I took the Boston team, so me and him had a little bit of a battle going on," Ngoepe told Deadspin. "Baseball would come on Sunday night and he would record it on his TV, when I guess the recording devices started coming out, so on Monday after school, we would go watch the game. "That's how we watched baseball. And then if we were trying to watch the World Series, we'd have to stay up late, especially on weekends, that's the only time we could watch." As a teenager, Ngoepe headed to Europe to attend a three-week MLB training camp, where he was discovered by the Pirates. But his journey was only just beginning, spending nine years in the lower levels of the organisation before finally reaching the big leagues. So now the scorecard reads: MLB players born in South Africa, one. MLB players born in New Zealand, zero. - NZ Herald Read more by Kris Shannon Email Kris Shannon Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Loading Plan of Attack Tammy struggles to comprehend the scale of the situation...

Even The World's Largest Internet Companies Get Phished, Just Like Your Grandma Libby Watson Apr 29, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  facebook google phishing whoops Share If you've ever been duped by a phishing scam, you can feel a little less stupid about it today, because you've been joined in that sad club by Google and Facebook. Image: Getty. Phishing attacks, where scammers pose as a trusted company or person via email and trick people into — for example — clicking a link, signing into a fake website, or even handing over their bank details, are a huge problem. And it works surprisingly often, particularly on older people (and senior members of Hillary Clinton's campaign staff). But it seems even the world's largest internet companies — organisations that have shaped the internet itself — are not immune from such attacks. A few weeks ago, the US Justice Department announced that it had arrested a Lithuanian man in connection with a phishing attack that scammed two unnamed US tech companies out of a total of $US100 million ($134 million). Now, an investigation by Fortune has revealed that those two companies are Facebook and Google. The scam was pretty sophisticated. Between 2013 and 2015, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly posed as a Taiwanese parts manufacturer named Quanta — which both companies do business with — through his own company with the same name registered in Latvia. He created fake email addresses and invoices for computer supplies, convincing the companies to make transfers totalling $US100 million ($134 million), which he then wired to bank accounts around the world. Rimasauskas denies the charge. Both Facebook and Google confirmed that they had been victims of the scam. In an email to Gizmodo, a Facebook spokesperson wrote: Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation. We are confident that we have the proper controls in place to prevent such attacks in the future. The spokesperson didn't respond to our query about whether the company had implemented any new measures to stop a similar incident from happening again. Meanwhile, a Google spokesperson told Fortune, "We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." An important twist reported by Fortune? Google and Facebook didn't disclose this event to shareholders, which may mean they ran afoul of rules requiring them to disclose "material events". Fortune's sources close to the companies "suggested they had decided the Rimasauskas fraud was not material enough to require disclosure of it". $US100 million ($134 million) over two years sounds reasonably material to us, but what do we know? Whether or not these companies misled their shareholders, one thing is sure: No one, whether it's your grandma who sent over her bank details to someone from CommonwealthBank dot yahoo dot com or one of the richest companies in the world, is safe from phishing.

It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn't just another smartphone -- this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void -- yikes!

I'd like you to try and remember that feeling over the next couple of weeks, because the US government wants that to change.

What We Use, 2017 Edition: The stuff Corbin can't live without Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 8:26am PDTApr 28, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 17 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Features What We Use Series Article Contents 1 Hardware 1.0.1 Phone: Google Pixel 1.0.2 Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 1.0.3 Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' 1.0.4 Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') 1.0.5 Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) 1.0.6 Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 1.0.7 Smart speaker: Google Home 1.0.8 Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE 1.0.9 Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 1.0.10 Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock 2 Software 2.0.1 Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) 2.0.2 Signal Spy (Android) 2.0.3 InputMapper (Windows) 2.0.4 Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) 3 Conclusion You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police! Conclusion Wow, this post was long. If you have any questions about the hardware or software in this list, feel free to ask me in the comments below.

I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Alphabet Rides Advertising Strength to New Highs With the help of its core business, the internet search juggernaut continues to expand its reach. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Apr 28, 2017 at 7:16PM Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) released strong first-quarter 2017 results on Thursday after the market closed, highlighted by continued strength in mobile and YouTube, as well as sustained momentum for its other bets segment. Let's take a closer look, then, at what drove Alphabet's business to start this year, and what investors should expect from the company going forward. IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET INC. The big picture Quarterly revenue grew 22.2% year over year (24% at constant currency), to $24.75 billion, and translated to 23% growth in operating income, to $6.568 billion. On the bottom line, GAAP net income increased 29%, to $5.426 billion, and net income per diluted share climbed 28.4%, to $7.73. Google doesn't provide specific financial guidance, but both the top and bottom lines were well ahead of consensus estimates for revenue of $24.19 billion and earnings of $7.40 per share.  "Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017," added Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. "We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet." Alphabet breaks its results in to two primary segments: Google and "other bets." Here's how they performed as compared to the same year-ago period: Metric 3 Months Ended March 31, 2016 3 Months Ended March 31, 2017 Year-Over-Year Growth Google segment revenues $20.092 billion $25.802 billion 28.4% Google operating income $6.245 billion $7.598 billion 21.7% Other bets revenues $165 million $244 million 47.9% Other bets operating income (loss) ($774 million) ($855 million) N/A DATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. On Google Let's start with Google, which is obviously Alphabet's bread-and-butter segment and includes Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, Google Play, Gmail, and YouTube, as well as Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware. Advertising comprised the bulk of Google's revenue, as usual, rising 18.8% year over year, to $21.411 billion. Within that, ad revenue from Google sites rose 21.5%, to $17.403 billion, with the largest contributor being healthy growth from mobile search. Advertising from Google network members' properties grew 8.6%, to $4.008 billion. Meanwhile, Aggregate paid clicks grew 44% year over year, including 53% growth in paid clicks on Google sites and a 10% increase in those on network members' properties. Aggregate cost per click -- which essentially measures how much Google makes per ad -- declined 19% year over year, including 21% and 17% declines on Google properties and network member properties, respectively. For that, investors can partly thank the continued outperformance of YouTube, where TrueView ads tend to reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel and thus monetize at lower rates than traditional web ads. That said, Alphabet also noted it changed its methodology for paid clicks and cost per click this quarter "to include additional categories of TrueView engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats." As a result, the above metrics reflect "a modest increase in paid clicks and a modest decrease in cost-per-click." Google also kindly offered perspective with updated figures for several previous quarters using the new methodology. For example, last quarter, aggregate paid clicks climbed 36% as reported, and cost per click fell 15%. But using the new method, Q4 2016 aggregate paid clicks would have reflected higher 39% growth, and the decline in cost per click would have been closer to 17%. Finally, other (non-advertising) revenue within Google increased a strong 49.4% year over year, to $3.095 billion, driven by Play, hardware, and cloud solutions. On other bets Next, Google's other bets segment remained unprofitable, as expected, while continuing to drive solid 47.9% year-over-year growth in revenue (to $244 million) from its conglomeration of compelling early-stage businesses. Similar to the past several quarters since Alphabet shifted to this segment-based reporting approach, other bets revenue was primarily generated by Nest (connected home products), Verily (life sciences), and Fiber (high-speed internet). But its operating loss also includes the costs of other mostly pre-revenue businesses like Calico (focused on human longevity), Google Capital (capital investments), and Google X ("moonshot" projects). "In Other Bets, we're determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each bet given their stage of development and achievements against milestones," Porat elaborated during this quarter's conference call. "We expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization." Alphabet regularly reminds investors that because these businesses operate in a number of disparate industries, and in various stages of growth, their results don't enjoy the same level of relative predictability as the mature advertising segment. Looking forward During the call, Porat also discussed the virtuous cycle created by its core ad business, stating: The strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings. Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector, and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity. Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us, and you've seen the early indicators again this quarter. All things considered, it's apparent that Alphabet is firing on all cylinders, with multiple irons in the fire enabled by its thriving advertising operations. With shares of Alphabet sitting near an all-time high today, I think current investors should be more than pleased with where their company stands.

And the massive size of Amazon’s cloud offering, Amazon Web Services, and the growth of Microsoft’s own cloud business, Azure, is not good news for Google. Despite the fact that cloud is still a relatively new industry with lots of room for growth, early entrants are more likely to dominate. That means it’ll be that much harder for Google to catch up — or, as Google executive Diane Greene recently said, surpass big players like AWS. One reason for this is that for every customer Amazon gains, that’s a potential addition Google has lost. Changing from one cloud provider to another is technically extremely difficult, making it a better approach to nab companies as they first buy into cloud services rather than luring them in later. Amazon’s cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.7 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft’s Azure gained 93 percent in the same period. The company doesn’t break out revenue for Azure, but the unit was reported to make $2.7 billion in 2016. Google also doesn’t break out cloud revenue, but what AWS makes in a quarter is easily more than Google cloud makes in a year. Also, should Amazon see any threat from Google or Microsoft, it could just as easily lower its rates and weather the losses to gain marketshare. That’s usually been CEO Jeff Bezos’ playbook. Still, there’s a lot of room for growth in cloud. Gartner predicts that by 2020 the market will reach $383 billion. And Amazon’s growth is decelerating. So if Google continues to gain large customers — it recently announce HSBC and SAP were using its public cloud — it can gain ground, but it’s working against a penalty for being a latecomer. Alphabet lumps cloud revenue into Google’s other revenues, which grew 50 percent year over year, from $2 billion in the first quarter of 2016 to $3 billion in the last quarter. Hardware and software are also in that mix. It’s not clear how much of the $3 billion is from cloud, but cloud is “one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet” and saw the most sizable headcount growth of all product areas, Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call Thursday. An RBC estimate put Google cloud’s annual run-rate revenue at about $1 billion as of the end of 2015. Even if revenue has grown significantly in the last year, it looks like it will continue to be dwarfed by competition unless Google ramps up its on-boarding of big new customers or makes major acquisitions.

Most of the pay consisted of Alphabet stock that the company valued at $198.7 million in securities documents filed Friday. Alphabet gave the award to Pichai in January 2016, a few months after he succeeded Larry Page as Google’s CEO. Pichai still reports to Page, a Google co-founder who is now Alphabet’s CEO. Page limits his annual pay to $1 because he already has an estimated fortune of $41 billion. The stock that Pichai received will vest in quarterly increments through January 2020. The 44-year-old Pichai also received a $650,000 salary last year in addition to personal security services and air travel valued at $372,000. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Google Photos v2.14 is preparing personalized experiences and sharing suggestions based around facial recognition [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:08pm PDTApr 26, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares192 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News When the Photos app launched in 2015, Google had already been working on computer vision for many years. It was no surprise that object recognition was a major draw for the app, and automatic sorting of pictures by person with the use of facial recognition became a must-have feature. Google is now looking to leverage this technology to make the Photos app a bit more social. A teardown of the latest Photos update reveals the service will soon offer additional features based around facial recognition, and even encourage users to share pictures with the people detected in them. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Since facial recognition is a sensitive privacy topic, it's worth a quick sanity check to reduce confusion and knee-jerk reactions going into this teardown. Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. I'll leave it up to each reader to determine how they feel about the remaining functions and their practical implications. Face recognition for personalization, sharing, and more Instead of opening with the reason this feature might be useful, I'm going to jump straight to a summary of how Google is going to present it. Quite simply, the Photos app is going to ask users to "personalize" their experience by selecting a picture of themselves from the list of previously identified faces. If you already named yourself, the group might be renamed "Me" after making the selection. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_title">Personalize Google Photos by labeling your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_desc">Which face is yours?</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_picker_face_picker_title">Select your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_confirmation_toast_msg">All set! Try searching for “Me”.</string> Face recognition isn't just the tool, it's actually part of the pitch to get users interested. Google's explanation is broken up into two parts, the first of which offers to reward users for choosing a face with "personalized search, creations, and more." <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc0">Get personalized search, creations, and more based on your face?</string> Personalized search is explained by the toast message above – it just means you can search for "me" to find pictures of yourself. I assume "creations" are the same auto-generated albums, collages, and animations we usually see in the Assistant tab, but obviously focused on you, the user. Both of these sound like things we have now. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc1">Allow your contacts' Google Photos apps to recognize your face in photos for faster sharing? &lt;a href=help:&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;</string> It's the second part of the explanation where things get interesting. If you have identified your face for Google Photos, you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken. To be clear, this can only happen for people if they are in your contact list and if you've given permission for it to make matches.

settings for managing the new facial recognition features, but they are just there to turn the grouping features on and off, or to change the face you selected in the past – perhaps you tapped on the wrong mug during setup, or maybe had plastic surgery, I guess. code <string name="photos_settings_faceclustering_advanced_face_recognition_setting_title">Face grouping</string> <string

My biggest question is what users will see after they take a picture of somebody else and a match is made. Primarily, will the photographer be prompted to share the photo, will it quietly include some visual marker that somebody was detected, or will it remain quiet and simply make intelligent suggestions if the share button is pressed? A big feature like this is probably not going to trigger quietly, so I expect notifications, but that could get pretty overwhelming after something like an office party or family reunion. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many unanswered questions, and since the implementation isn't done and there are missing pieces, there aren't going to be answers quite yet. The potential problem for features like this is that they tip-toe right up to the line where many people feel uncomfortable about potential privacy issues. It looks like Google has done a good job of designing barriers to avoid some of those issues, and it's clear users are responsible for making their own decisions. It's important that this is an opt-in feature by default. I do like the idea of using facial recognition to smooth out the rough edges of sharing photos with people, especially if it also acts as a reminder. I admit, I have a bad habit of taking pictures of friends and forgetting to share them later. If this goes well, Google might have the killer feature that turns Photos into a must-use service.

Southern Discomfort Yep, see this as super profitable for the big G. Knows your face, scans all your pictures and notices a slew of recent pictures all showing Best Buy in the background. Guess what shows up in your Gmail inbox within moments...?? Yeah, I don't know. This sounds like the tide turning type of thing and is actually kinda spooky for me. I get that Goog does this type of thing, but dang... Willie Chalmers III I really doubt that's going to happen. It's a slippery slope, and if they wanted to do that, they likely would have done it by now to some extent, and people would notice. James Briano Oh, Google already knows. When I search Drive for "Best Buy" I get a lot of interesting results. Example attached. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/45ff7b47285e47474877510e0456d559a7344aca80b48062d208178aa0e33897.jpg Theo Logian There is likely location data attached to that photo rather than image recognition of that big yellow tag. tik Yup... location based versus recognizing text in the image. trekker Photos face recognition is brilliant - especially when visiting a friend and quickly being able to find photos from the past to enjoy together. However currently they decide who gets a name label (or tag) and this means i have many people who remain unsearchable. Please can we manually add names ourselves? The system where Google provides choices for names does not work. Prosti95 Maybe I misunderstand you, but AFAIK you are able to name them by yourself. trekker Only the faces selected by Google can be named. There are about 300 you have as choices and once they are named there are only many from crowd shots selected which are options. I have many more people from years ago in scanned photos who I would like to name and be able to successfully search for. Currently impossible as there is no manual selection (which was an option in Picasa). whispy_snippet "you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken." Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? If I go to the auto generated "people" album I can see a whole bunch of photos of people clustered via facial recognition. Yes, I had to turn this feature on and individually label people, but the end result is now effectively the same. My app recognises faces. Jens M Eichkorn What's new is that it will associate faces with actual names / Google accounts whispy_snippet Sure, I understand that. But what I'm trying to say is that if a user chooses to do so, they can make Google Photos do this already. The tear down gives the impression that a person needs to opt-in to allow their face to be recognised in images taken by someone else. What I'm saying is that I can already go into my Photos app, enable face recognition, label some faces and bam, I'm getting the same result. This teardown suggests people can soon can opt-in to something that's already effectively live anyway. What seems new is that the process looks more streamlined. But I'd have thought many people would be more concerned with a right to opt-in to facial recognition, not a right to opt-in to a more streamlined process. Am I making sense? I feel like I'm not articulating myself well here. Cody Toombs You're making sense, and perhaps this is a part I could have explained differently, or more completely, maybe? This isn't really the easiest thing to explain, especially with so many missing pieces. Anyway, here's the main difference as far as I can tell right now: In its current state, facial recognition occurs in the cloud with all of the pictures you've taken and matching faces are placed into groups. These groups can then be named. You obviously know that part. The thing about these face matchings is they don't exist beyond your account, nor do they actually correlate to your contact list or social graph. The real world comparison would be that you've been handed a stack of photos and asked to find all the instances of a random face, put them in a stack, then put a post-it note on top of it with a random name. I believe this isn't considered a privacy issue (except in Europe) because it's all based on data that belongs to you. This new feature performs the same matching, but it uses an image (or maybe many images) belonging to somebody else to perform the matches, even if those images never actually reach you. Google is still transmitting some information to you that relates to another person, even if it's only to confirm that there's a match and it's somebody that has you in their contact list. Additionally, and this part is super unclear at this stage (I kinda avoided bringing it up in the post for obvious reasons), we don't know if Google will transmit any additional information, which may include the person's name or some sort of contact details to make it possible to share the photo. For example, this might explain why some stuff related to Google+ contacts turned up in the last teardown of Photos (link). I personally don't worry about these things, but some people obviously do, and that's why users should give permission for it to happen. whispy_snippet Thanks very much for the explanation, Cody. Much appreciated. I guess any analysis based on incomplete information is always going to be a tough game to play. You obviously have the disclaimer at the start of each APK teardown for a reason! We'll just have to wait and see how it all plays out. As a general rule I'm definitely not the type to get paranoid or concerned about Google having mountains of data on me. I use just about every Google service there is, including Google Photos, and love the trade off​ of my data for web services. But yeah, many people do get concerned about these things and I can respect their position. I try to keep in touch with both sides of the fence on these discussions. Cody Toombs When I started writing this post, I thought back to the post we had about Nearby a couple of years ago. It was written correctly and honestly, but somehow it was picked up by some news organizations with a particular political slant and we were inundated by people that took a very extreme, very negative standpoint about the idea of Nearby. I wanted to cut that off and prevent undue outrage. I'm not sure if I overcorrected or not, but the response has been mostly neutral, so at least I feel like it was handled fairly. whispy_snippet I think you guys get it right. As far as I can tell AP has a very, very strong reputation in the tech community. Sometimes there's not a lot you can do if someone has an agenda they want to fulfill! JG Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? From the article: Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. whispy_snippet Ah yep, I must have missed that bit. Well it makes sense. But yeah, I guess my other key question still stands - why is there a need to give people the option to opt-in to something that's effectively out of their hands? Your face can already be recognised in someone else's Google Photos "people" album. David Hyman What if it knew you were together and it automatically shared the pictures with other people. Basically automatically creating a shared album Paul_Werner I'd love that Mark Dodsworth Automatic sharing is never a good thing, I'm sure that the shared album thing is going to happen. One of the guys in charge of Google Photos was behind this app: https://vimeo.com/46398388 Mark Dodsworth If you want to see more about how the above app worked here's a video: https://youtu.be/0T9Ii37yuKw it used location to match people in shared albums. I bet location sharing will be added to facial recognition in Google Photos. Cody Toombs I tend to agree with Mark. Automation is good, but when it involves sharing potentially private data, things can get harry really fast. I would want the app to ask my permission before sharing anything with somebody else. Just think of all the backlash Facebook received when people started discovering there had been intentional loopholes to allow things to become more public than they were intended to be. Kevfromspace Any news on printing Google Photos albums a la Apple Photos Books? Cody Toombs You know, something about that did turn up last year in August (link), but I haven't seen any activity on it since. I think the couple of things related to that were also removed, so it may have been scrapped or placed on a backburner for now. Kevfromspace Damnit! Ever since I read that original teardown post last year I've been waiting patiently, hoping I could print an album of a trip I did with my girlfriend before her birthday this June. Looking more unlikely by the day. Cody Toombs It would be cool if Google opened up an API to Photos so print shops could work with people independently. Google itself shouldn't have to do the printing, but it would be neat if somebody could. sodsavage Or just better printing options in general, theres next to none right now. Some of us still do like prints of our photos, smh. rickneworleansla I've been wondering about this also. Currently I have to download then re-upload to a photo printing service. Seems like google could make some money by mailing out photos, digital DVD copies, movies, etc. Their current full album download process is terrible and failed the three times I tried. I probably have too many photos. The files were huge. tik Definitely excited with all of the new updates. But, at the same time, it'd be great if Google Photos could... - Batch edit pictures - Batch remove pictures/albums from Google Photos (instead of the 1500 picture limit) - Batch download pictures to device Si vis pacem, para bellum The feature I am waiting for the most is some damn basic drawing tool while editing a photo... Basicly that's why I am still using the Samsung default gallery as my primary gallery app on both my smartphone and tablet. oningam about face recognition I would like to force it on some contacts that for some reason are not picked up or they are only at a later time. Also I'd like to get a numeric badge on each thumb to know the number of images in it and also a way to know if there are new association because quite frequently I have to go trough all of them and remove wrong matches on already identified people. About editing I'm still waiting for a way to modify date and insert position on single and batch of selected pictures. DavidB23 Agree 100% on all counts. An easy way to edit the dates in batch or one at a time is at the top of my list of improvements Ibrahim Yusuf A feature that Europe won't get 😑 Mark Dodsworth That's the thing I worry about seeing this, a pretty huge feature to miss out on. Tomáš Petrík If at least they made it opt-in, so that I could willingly enable that... Markoff As European I am fine with that actually. Ibrahim Yusuf I'm glad that Europe has these privacy laws, but I want to have the choice to opt-in to some of these features even if I sacrifices some of my privacy osullz I think it's bizarre that I still can't search for photos with the phrase 'Person X AND Person Y' or ask the Google Assistant to "show me photos of Person X AND Person Y." Facebook's Knowledge Graph is able to do that much and Google surely could as well. Mark Dodsworth I do those searches in Google Photos all the time, you can separate names by comma or and. osullz Well go figure. The day I posted this it wouldn't do anything except for say there were no results but now it of course does it no problem. Urmil Shroff Damn, Photos is getting cooler and cooler. Markoff indeed, was fan of 3rd party galleries like Piktures, but gave up having Photos in phone just for online backup and Piktures for viewing photos, when they pushed video stabilizing update, tne I just got rid off Piktures on mine and wives phone as well though I am not fan of providing facial data to google, so I am not using this feature Ola Stensson So are they EVER gonna launch the face feature at all outside the US? I think it's been two years now... jeremylea I still wish they would tag bad photos and suggest automatically deleting them... For an AI, detecting pictures of fingers, carpets, ceilings, motion blur, all black, all white, etc., etc., should be easy, and the training sample is already there - just look in people's trash. Al Ked One thing I wish they'd add is de-duplication. Backing stuff up from a few different sources I always end up with some duplicates. It would be cool if it found them out and allowed me to remove the duplicates.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly $199.7 million in compensation last year, double the amount he made in 2015, according to a filing Friday from Google's parent company, Alphabet. Pichai's base pay was a mere $650,000. On top of that, he received a stock award for $198.7 million. The company's compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai's promotion to CEO and "numerous successful product launches." Pichai, a longtime Google executive, took over as CEO as part of a corporate restructuring in 2015. Larry Page, Google's cofounder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. These efforts have started to pay off for the company. Google's "other revenues," a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet's stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(Photo: Chandan Khanna / Getty Images) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Alphabet Inc. can’t seem to stop heaping massive pay packages on Google’s Sundar Pichai. The chief executive officer of the search-engine unit received $199.7 million in compensation for 2016, according to a regulatory filing Friday. That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay — a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud. He oversaw a 17.8 percent jump in Google’s core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai’s 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job. The award was granted about six months after the tech business announced it would reorganize into holding company Alphabet. As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity. It wasn’t the first time following in Page’s footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice president of products and took over many of Page’s responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid U.S. executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn’t required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don’t reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn’t disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The Mountain View, California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said “encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business.” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat got a $39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019.

James Martin/CNET Car Tech by Shara Tibken 29 April 2017 8:32 am AEST @sharatibken Apple, Alphabet's Waymo, Tesla and dozens of other companies would like some changes to California's self-driving car policies. The companies -- along with dozens of other organizations like Lyft, Uber, Ford and Toyota -- submitted comments to the Department of Motor Vehicles, which were then posted online. The suggestions range the gamut from deciding when a driver should have to take control of the autonomous vehicle to recommending paying customers be allowed to ride in self-driving cars. See also Uber's self-driving cars back in SF, but now they're legal ​Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Apple receives autonomous-car testing permit in California The DMV told CNET that it's currently reviewing the public comments received on the proposed autonomous vehicle regulations. If it decides to make changes to its regulations, it will hold a 15-day public comment period for organizations and individuals to weigh in. Autonomous car technology has become a big focus for companies such as Google and Uber, and speculation about Apple's self-driving car plans have been swirling for months. It's unclear whether the company wants to build an autonomous vehicle of its own or if it wants to power the infotainment and other systems of a car. Apple obtained a permit earlier this month to test self-driving cars in California. Apple -- in its letter signed by Steve Kenner, its director of product integrity -- said it's "investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation." It wants to see changes to three California policies related to "disengagement reporting," definitions, and testing without safety drivers. Apple's letter One of Apple's criticisms focused on current and proposed disengagement reporting requirements, which explain when a driver has to take control of the self-driving car. Apple said the metric isn't transparent enough to make consumers comfortable with the technology. The company believes the correct metric for evaluating automated vehicles should include data on successfully prevented crashes and traffic rule violations. Google's Waymo wants you to test its self-driving cars Average folks in Arizona can get a lift from a self-driving minivan. by Bridget Carey 1:11 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF California's current regulations would make companies detail how many times humans had to take over control of the system because of a system failure or traffic, weather or road situation, according to Reuters. Apple wants disengagement to be defined as "an unexpected event or failure that requires the safety driver to take control of the vehicle in order to prevent a crash or traffic violation." It also said disengagements shouldn't be reported for system errors or failures, the end of a test or experiment, or several other scenarios. The other two changes Apple requested relate the definition of development vehicles and testing without a safety driver. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Other comments Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Alphabet, had some issues with regulations related to driver v. no driver as the key distinction, the definition of "remote operator," liability, and information privacy. "We're encouraged by the DMV efforts to develop regulations for autonomous vehicles that would help California remain a leader in the development of self-driving cars," Waymo said in a statement. "Waymo looks forward to deploying this life-saving technology in the state." Tesla, whose founder -- Elon Musk -- wants to make self-driving semis and buses, argued that vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds shouldn't immediately be banned from testing or deployment on public roads. It also said it shouldn't be prevented from selling a non self-driving car that previously was tested as an autonomous vehicle. "This prohibition appears to have been written without consideration for vehicles that were used as autonomous test vehicles but contain only production hardware and, once loaded with production software, are indistinguishable from production vehicles," the company said. "This is the case with many Tesla autonomous test vehicles." Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Uber, meanwhile, said paying members of the public should be able to ride in autonomous test vehicles with drivers. The ride-sharing service got in trouble with California late last year for putting self-driving cars on the road and for picking up paying customers without permission of the DMV. Within hours of the self-driving car launch in San Francisco in December, California's DMV told the company it was breaking the law and needed to halt the program until it got a permit. Uber refused to back down and said it would keep the cars on the road. After a week of back-and-forth between Uber and the DMV, along with an intervention from California's Office of the Attorney General, the DMV announced it was revoking the registration of 16 of the company's autonomous vehicles. Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Uber's main rival, Lyft, said language requiring autonomous car companies to notify local authorities about tests is "ambiguous" and could create confusion and delays in the testing process. It proposed that the DMV could operate a webpage where manufacturers could post notices regarding their proposed testing areas. "Such a website would not only streamline the notice requirements, but also increase public access to this information," it said in its letter. Lyft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Car laws The state of California has been working on autonomous vehicle regulations for nearly two years. In mid-December 2015, it released its first draft for review. In September 2016, it released its revised draft. After taking into account feedback, California published its latest proposed regulations on March 10, which set off a 45-day public comment hearing. Along with big tech companies, other commenters during that time included insurers, car dealers' associations, "a concerned citizen" and Fathers Against Drunk Driving. The DMV plans to summarize and respond to all comments when it submits its regulations to the Office of Administrative Law for approval. If the OAL approves the regulations, they become law that go into effect 120 days after their approval. The DMV estimates the regulations could be in effect by the end of November, a spokesperson said. Reuters earlier reported the news. Does the Mac still matter?

This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, May 10, 2017: When Surveillance Goes Private: A 2027 Retrospective from Adrian Hon Location: Mozilla London + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: It’s 2027. In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Adrian Hon is CEO and founder at Six to Start, co-creators of the most successful smartphone fitness game in the world, Zombies, Run!. The game has won awards for its stories and storylike games, and the team’s work has been displayed at the MOMA and Design Museum in London. He’s the author of A History of the Future in 100 Objects, and he used to write about technology for The Telegraph. Previously, Adrian was Executive Producer and Director of Play at Mind Candy from 2004 to 2007, where he designed and produced the Perplex City alternate reality game (ARG). Adrian’s interest in ARGs began with the genre itself in 2001, when as a moderator for the Cloudmakers community for ‘The Beast’ (an ARG for Steven Spielberg’s A.I.), he wrote a detailed walkthrough for the game, called ‘The Guide.' During that time, Adrian studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in experimental psychology and neuroscience. In 2003, he began a neuroscience DPhil at Oxford, but left after a year to join Mind Candy. Adrian has also spoken at the main TED conference in Monterey in 2001 (about the human colonisation of Mars), as well as various SXSW, GDC, Economist, and other such tech and gaming conferences. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, July 20, 2017: Are you an introvert? Working Across Personality Types with Jennifer Selby-Long Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Engineers are introverted. Agile = meetings all the time. Which is great… for the extraverts. Over the past year a few hundred staff at Mozilla have used the Insights Discovery tool to better learn about their individual personality temperaments, and to be more effective on their teams. But can these tests really help us? What’s the real science behind them? Can they be abused? Or are there ways they can help us work together better? On July 20, Jennifer Selby Long, an expert in the ethical use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®), will lead us in a very interactive session on this material. She’ll help us explore these frameworks and the science behind them, with a focus specifically on their Introversion / Extraversion dimensions and workplace collaboration. Importantly, we’ll make it personal, rolling up our sleeves with some exercises to help us explore how our (and our team’s) MBTI preferences can help us work together better, regardless of job description, culture, or demographics. Hosts: Matt Frassica & Tyler Haugen Speaker: Jennifer Selby-Long Jennifer Selby Long is an executive coach, management consultant, and MBTI® expert who helps technology leaders navigate the challenges of seismic change to achieve their highest potential. She also advises on the impact of personality and gender on financial behavior. Jennifer is the past president of the Association for Psychological Type. She has been quoted by business and technology writers in the Fast Company, Information World, Dice.com, Univision, and the Bulletin of Psychological Type. She is an award-winning business writer and the author of Traveling Light, a blog helping leaders skyrocket their impact and lighten the load in their lives. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Hashtag: #mozSS Deck materials also in this post May 26, 2016: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years with Kevin Kelly, Wired Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 26 @ Mozilla SF - 10:30am PT / 1:30pm ET / 6:30pm UTC Topic: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends already in motion. Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016.

Hashtag: #mozSS #theinevitable April 27, 2016: When Change is the Only Constant, with Kirsten Wolberg, PayPal Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, April 27 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: When Change is the Only Constant, Org Structure Doesn’t Matter While it may be true in tech that “change is the only constant,” some changes are bigger than others. Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

But the jump in revenues hides a large problem that hasn't been solved. From Matthew Lynley at Techcrunch The Google core business is, as usual, quite boringly efficient. We tend to see the same story every quarter - the value of each ad (cost-per-click) goes down while the number of ad impressions goes up, and Google makes a ton of money in the process. The financial results contain Google's little huge secret: Google is bad at creating ad value - it is forced to grow revenues by chasing quantity over quality. From $GOOG Q1 2017: Alphabet/Google is making huge profits but all web users lose out because to make money Google has to find new ways of grabbing attention for less effective ads. The user experience is being continually degraded. The tens of thousands of the world's top computer engineers employed at Google have quarter-after-quarter failed to reverse this loss in ad value. Instead Google distracts the curious by pointing to self-driving cars and "moon-shots" that have nothing to do with its core business. This loss of ad value hasn't harmed Google's profits but it has greatly affected revenues for the media industry which faces high content production costs. Wasting people's time on ever larger numbers of ineffective ads is not a sustainable business strategy -- and it is unethical, imho. Yet this is the only way this company knows how to drive revenues. Look over there - that car is driving itself! The web user experience stinks... The Vivaldi browser offers an easy upgrade from Google Chrome Most browsers are now being dumbed down to appeal to the mass market, but Vivaldi - now at the beta 2 stage - is going the other way, to appeal to "power users" Read More With a ransom malware epidemic and suspiciously fake content everywhere - added to an expanding universe of trillions of crappy ads - the web experience feels ever more corrupt and icky than sticky. And watch what you touch - even hyperlinks from friends are suspicious. If you can't trust the hyperlink there is no web (and no Google). As the web experience becomes less appealing people will likely rediscover the delights of a simple walk along a street or in a park - experiencing the high-definition multi-sense reality of reality. No ad blocker needed. But watch where you step.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > How to set Google as your homepage in the most… How to set Google as your homepage in the most popular browsers By Tyler Lacoma — April 28, 2017 12:30 PM Subscribe Share alexeyboldin/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Are you getting tired of turning your browser away from whatever your homepage is to visit the Google homepage? Would you like to automatically open to Google’s home page every time you used your browser? There is a way! Check below for your preferred browser and instructions on how to switch your homepage to Google from now on. How to set Google as the homepage in any browser Microsoft Edge Edge offers two different options, based on what your idea of a home page looks like. We’ll give you both of them. First, open an Edge Window and select More actions (the dots in the upper right of the screen) and then Settings. Then select View advanced settings from the list. This will provide a number of options to toggle – look for the one that says, “Show the home button” and make sure that it is toggled on. Then set it to “A specific page” in the dropdown menu. In the space below, enter google.com and Save your choice. Now, whenever you click on the Home button, it will take you to Google. If your idea of a home setting is more alone of the lines of, “Whatever page that opens when I start Edge,” then you can do that too. Under the Settings options, look for a choice that says “Open Microsoft Edge With.” Here you can enter google.com for the effect you want. Google Chrome Google Chrome should, under normal circumstances, automatically take you to a window with the search bar and several of your favorite websites, so many Chrome users may not even have to worry about this step. But if you want to set a more official home screen or double-check that everything is still working, here’s what to do. Click the More button, a.k.a. the three dots you can find at the upper right of the screen. Then select Settings. Scroll until you find the Appearance. Here, look for an option that says Show Home button. Make sure that this is checked. It should automatically bring up the www.google.com/ address, but if it doesn’t you can click Change and type it in. You may want to sign into Chrome and sync your settings to make sure the change is fully applied across all devices. Note: This option may not work if you are using Chrome on a tablet or phone, where settings options are a little more limited. Safari Safari gives you a couple different options to work with, depending on how you prefer to browse, so it’s worth it to spend a few extra moments customizing the results. First open up Safari, select Safari in the upper left corner of the screen, and then select Preferences. From here, select General. Look for the heading that says Homepage with a space next to it. You can either type in google.com, or if you’re already on the Google site you can choose the button below, which says Set to Current page. Safari also has several important headers higher in the General window. “Safari opens with” allows you to choose if you want to open with your previous windows as a time-saving shortcut. “New windows open with” and “New tabs open with” both allow you to set them to Homepage to make sure that you will allows start with the Google search no matter how you like to open new sites. Choose the options that work best for you! Firefox No worries here, Firefox offers the easiest option by far. Open up Firefox, and go to the Google home website with the search bar you know and love. Click/Select the tab itself (the bumper where the title of the page usually is) and hold down. Then drag that tab right, over to the homepage button that Firefox uses in the taskbar – it looks like a little house and it’s hard to miss. This will bring up a quick notification asking you if you really want to set this as your home page. Select Yes, and you’re done. If you want to delete and replace current home page options more directly, click the three-line menu button and go to Preferences. From here, select the General tab and look for the Startup under Home Page, choose Restore to Default, which will clear any past choices. Advanced option: Set a series of tabs to open The Google homepage is nice, but a little limited in its usefulness. Chances are good that you already know several webpages you want to visit when you open your browser. There are a variety of options you can use to set several of those pages to open when you first start the browser, saving you a lot of time. We encourage you to set these pages if it’s a daily routine for you – you just need to find the right option. Google Chrome offers you a way to continue where you left off, Firefox lets you set multiple pages as your home page, and Mac computers allow you to automatically open websites when you first log onto your computer, and so on. This may prove a more useful solution than visiting the Google search bar over and over

Most of the changes announced Tuesday are designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "fake news." Besides trying to block fake news, Google has reprogrammed a popular feature to omit derogatory search suggestions. Associated Press   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post WP Bloomberg     Thanks to the phenomenon of "fake news," Google is going to start asking you for help with its search results rather than relying solely on its algorithms. The search giant said Tuesday that it will make it much easier for anyone to give it feedback on its search results, which is the way that most people use Google. For everyday users, that means that if you see a result featured on Google's pages that you think is wrong or offensive, then you can actually do something about it. Google framed the problem as a quality issue. "Today, in a world where tens of thousands of pages are coming online every minute of every day, there are new ways that people try to game the system," said vice president of engineering Ben Gomes in an official blog post. According to Google, approximately .25 percent of its results "have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content." The company didn't specify how many queries that really is - but the search-engine-focused news site Search Engine Land reported that Google estimated in 2015 that it handles 3 billion searches per day. Some back-of-the-envelope math suggests that users could be seeing as many as 7.5 million misleading results every day. Users will see options to report bad information that shows up in "Featured Snippets" - a.k.a., the little summary boxes that appear at the top or sides of Google searches. They will also be able to report offensive autocomplete suggestions - the suggested phrases that show up when you begin typing a query in the search engine. Users can report suggestions for being hateful, explicit or violent. For the snippets, users can also report when the summaries are inaccurate. Google has also tweaked its search algorithms to ensure that "low-quality" content shows up lower in search results, which should minimize their reach. This should address issues such as one Google dealt with last year, when a prominent Holocaust denial site showed up at the top of search results for "did the holocaust happen." Since the U.S. election, several companies including Google and Facebook have taken steps to deal with false information that looks legitimate being passed through their products. In the past, both companies have been hesitant to step in and provide quality controls for information that appears on their products, preferring instead to let their algorithms weed out bad results. And like Facebook, Google has recently undertaken broader efforts to fight misleading information and hate speech online. The company has started pairing some claims online with fact-check articles, which say whether a claim is true or false. It has also released a tool for developers to let them automatically moderate online messages better. Google users will start seeing the reporting options Tuesday. This particular effort has been underway since mid-December, said Google spokeswoman Susan Cadrecha in an email. google Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Washington Post Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 39 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%. Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs and an increase in volume. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's coming earnings release drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement.

Especially as competitors like FB are taking up more of the ad pie. 😆😄 I know you read 9to5G also... today there was an article that quotes the head of Google Cloud Platform saying they will surpass Amazon in 2022. Will that do it for you? Roger Siegenthaler and you believe them? ddevito No they won't. Enterprises don't trust Google abc Surpass Amazon in what? Amazon's cloud powers many of the internet's most popular sites. If the head of Google Cloud genuinely believes that he will beat them by 2022, then he's a moron. You obviously are a fanboy, which you makes you a moron by definition. Suicide_Note Which is why they have other projects and endeavors aside from search.

I'll update the post with the new numbers now that markets are open (and I am awake.) charlie Jason Interesting. Hopefully this will allow them to hire some competent designers to slim down the iBezels and competent supply managers keep their phones in stock. Max Johnson They could relocate some of the employees who currently are making new messaging apps. But in seriousness looks like they're working on that already. charlie Jason Really? Maybe bezel-less is too hard, but I definitely hope for reasonably slim bezels or at least front facing speakers for Pixel 2. Suicide_Note Maybe Alphabet can also spare a few bucks to hire someone competent to make your comments witty, insightful, original, and/or funny? charlie Jason Butthurt Pixel fanboy much? Aaron The iBezel part was lame, bro. But to your defense, whomever is responsible for the Pixels must have skipped the section on supply and demand in high school economics. Suicide_Note Don't know why you would make that assumption, considering i said nothing about the Pixel, not did i express any offense about his comment.

Defenestratus Time to start looking at breaking up Google, Apple and Facebook. abc No way. It's America. I say Google, Apple and Facebook should merge into one monopolistic behemoth. Then we can hear the most capitalist country on earth whine about the lack of competition. ddevito Is there any mention of how much revenue mobile advertising produced? Because that's the number that counts. Until Google/Alphabet/whateverthehelltheycallthemselves figures out a reliable way to grow revenue on mobile this is all smoke and mirrors, which is what the whole Alphabet fiasco was about TheScientists I thought I had read a story a few months back that mobile ad revenue had already surpassed desktop. Yep, here you go: https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Moves-Majority-Share-of-Googles-Worldwide-Ad-Revenues/1014633 Ryne Hager Yeah, I would have loved to see advertising actually divided up in the quarter's revenue reports. Some other marketing firms have put together their own estimates showing that mobile is accounting for most of it now. But, without details about revenue from mobile sites vs apps, etc., those third party estimates still don't tell much. I wish Google would be transparent about that. Aaron Really does look like since they're doing this good they could have chosen a better ODM for the Pixels. Either HTC sucks at manufacturing or Google has another issue entirely. No excuse for the Pixel to still be out of stock. Daan Smit Google doesn't care about you having a Pixel or not. You're not the customer; you're their (personal)-data-generating-life-stock. They want to collect your data from any Android device you can use. Pixes is just one of them and therefore not a focus point. Google's customers are enterprises buying target-advert content based on your personal data gathered. That's where their focus is and hence the profit. destinyhud well google care about pixel now that they are making profit for them as well. Klark Kenneth Those pesky taxes! Come on Trump, hurry up and get rid of corporate taxes so the rest of us can share the burden, Google needs a new pair of shoes!! jcopernicus "They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. " The intimation that cutting back is an action to increase revenue is so hilarious. Cut backs are made to stop losses, not to stimulate growth. Defenestratus Indeed, and there is only so much cutting back you can do. Ryne Hager I was just surprised. With the projects that did get cut this year I assumed at some level there had to be losses going on, but they still exceeded estimates. Even the moonshots (at least, as a whole), which includes Fiber, were able to keep things profitable with the layoffs and cuts there. I had an expectation at some level that those cut-backs were a negative indicator, and that ended up being entirely incorrect. TechGuy22 so much money and yet google can't get their shit together Doby Gillis Gee, if only they listened to you, I'm sure they'd do so much better. /s abc Well, even a 5 year old could come up with a better messaging app. Although five year olds probably love stickers too!

Google CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly $199.7 million in compensation last year, double the amount he made in 2015, according to a filing Friday from Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Pichai’s base pay was a mere $650,000. On top of that, he received a stock award for $198.7 million. The company’s compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai’s promotion to CEO and “numerous successful product launches.” Pichai, a longtime Google executive, took over as CEO as part of a corporate restructuring in 2015. Larry Page, Google’s cofounder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. These efforts have started to pay off for the company. Google’s “other revenues,” a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet’s stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time.

PHOTO: AFP Published10 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/42Go Copy Dominance in digital advertising follows shift in business focus SAN FRANCISCO • Google parent Alphabet posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday, as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 per cent to US$5.43 billion (S$7.58 billion), a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google's size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. "They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Like its archrival Facebook, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 per cent of the industry growth in digital advertising last year, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the Internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 per cent share of the search ad market worldwide this year, up from 60.6 per cent last year, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up for the difference, Mr Wang said. Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts: "Our great properties - like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play - are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested." Google's revenue rose 22.2 per cent to US$24.75 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 per cent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 per cent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to US$5.43 billion, or US$7.73 per share, from US$4.21 billion, or US$6.02 per share, a year earlier.

Pichai received a salary of $650,000 last year, slightly less than the $652,500 he earned in 2015. But the long-time Google employee, who was named CEO during the company's re-organization in August 2015, received a stock award of $198.7 million in 2016, roughly double his 2015 stock award of $99.8 million. That brought his total compensation last year to $199.7 million, almost twice the $100.6 million he earned a year earlier. show chapters Amazon and Alphabet racing to $1,000/share    12 Hours Ago | 02:33 Pichai's haul came even as his two bosses, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, once again drew salaries of only $1 for their roles as CEO and President, respectively, of parent company Alphabet. But Page and Brin are each worth more than $40 billion through their stock holdings. Pichai's raise came during a year when Google's sales rose 22.5 percent and net income rose 19 percent as it maintained its position as the top seller of Internet advertising. The shares of its parent company Alphabet, however, underperformed the broader market for tech stocks last year. Alphabet shares rose 5 percent in 2016, while the broad Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 10 percent. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat also enjoyed a significant raise last year. Porat, who was brought in two years ago from Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley to instill more fiscal discipline in the company's operations, earned $39 million in total compensation last year, up from $31 million in 2015. One more Google executive also saw a steep rise in compensation last year. Diane Greene, now senior vice president for Google's cloud operations, earned total compensation of $43.7 million last year, most of it via two stock awards totaling $42.8 million. That was up sharply from 2015, when Greene earned $454,000 as a director on the Alphabet board. She became a Google employee on Dec. 17, 2015, and as such is no longer compensated for her board service. Alphabet on Thursday reported first-quarter sales and profit that topped Wall Street expectations, sending its shares to a record high.

Blog Contact Us   Multimillion dollar phishing victims revealed Posted on April 28, 2017   The mystery surrounding the two unnamed tech giants that were duped out of more than $100m (£77.5m) in a phishing scam has been solved. In March, the US Justice Department announced that it had arrested a man who had impersonated an Asian supplier in order to perpetrate the massive swindle, but was tight lipped over the identities of those involved. However, the case has been cracked by Fortune.com, which announced that Facebook and Google had fallen for one of the oldest tricks in the book. History of a heist The conman was named as Evaldas Rimasauskas, who hatched the plot back in 2013. According to the Justice Department investigation, he created forgeries of invoices, email addresses and other corporate materials intended to fool companies into thinking he was Asian manufacturer Quanta Computer, which had supplied parts for Amazon’s Kindle and Apple watches. Facebook and Google worked with the company regularly. It was wildly successful. Over several years, it’s alleged that millions of dollars was transferred over to him and promptly squirreled away in Eastern European bank accounts. However, the long arm of the law caught up with Rimasauskas, and he is currently the target of extradition proceedings in Lithuania. Phishing scams involving criminals posing as suppliers are not new to the US Justice Department, but a source cited by Fortune said that this case was special due to the sheer scale of it. Was the money recovered? Fortune reached out to Facebook and Google to confirm that they had fallen for the con, and both companies replied to the effect that they had recovered most of their cash. A spokesperson at Facebook said: “Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.” Meanwhile, Google said: “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved.” Did Facebook and Google break business rules? When a publicly traded company experiences a major event such as this, they’re required to disclose it to their investors in line with the rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, public records show that neither company reported the fraud at all. This may be due to their sheer size; although being fleeced of $100m would sink most companies, in all likelihood it hardly makes a dent in Facebook and Google’s respective coffers. It’s not the money, it’s the principle At Engage Web, we think that the sum is not really the issue here. Phishing scams are still rife on the internet, and have become much more sophisticated in recent years. The last thing that any company would want to publicize is how fraudsters can get their hands on your money, and there’s potential for a lot of reputational damage. The PR departments for both companies already have enough work to do, and falling prey to a fake company while championing the fight against fake news is a wee bit embarrassing.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: What Happened in the Stock Market Today Alphabet and Starbucks stocks stood out as indexes declined. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Apr 28, 2017 at 4:39PM Stocks fell on Friday, with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes finishing lower by less than 0.25%. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (0.19%) (40.82) S&P 500 (0.19%) (4.57) Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Financial stocks saw some of the heaviest trading volumes, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) fell behind the broader market with a 1% drop. A small uptick in gold prices, meanwhile, helped push the the volatile Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG) up 3%. As for individual stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) attracted heavy investor interest following their respective quarterly earnings reports. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet posts broad growth Shares of Google parent Alphabet jumped almost 4% after the search giant announced surprisingly strong earnings. Sales jumped 22% to $24.75 billion and outpaced consensus estimates that were targeting $24.2 billion. Profits blew past expectations as earnings soared 28% to $7.73 per share. Wall Street would have been happy with $7.40 per share of profit. The Google business continues to shine, with operating income up 22% to $7.6 billion on surging advertising revenue. The segment benefited from stellar results in a young hardware segment that now includes the Google Home speaker and the Pixel smartphone. These newer revenue streams joined the booming growth in established areas like mobile search and YouTube to send overall operating margin up a full percentage point to 27% of sales. The company's Other Bets unit expanded its loss to $855 million from $774 million while boosting revenue by nearly 50% to $244 million. Executives were happy with the operating trends and telegraphed more aggressive spending on improving its search platform while pushing deeper into the hardware business. "Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017," Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a press release. "We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet," Porat continued. Starbucks sees an end to its traffic struggles Starbucks shares dipped 2% despite the coffee titan posting record fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings figures. Revenue rose 6% as a 3% boost in comparable-store sales combined with a quickly growing store base. The company also managed an uptick in profitability, with operating margin rising to 17.7% of sales from 17.3%. As a result, earnings rose at a healthy 15% clip to $0.45 per share. But Starbucks wasn't immune to the broader retailing slowdown that's hurting peers across the industry. Customer traffic was flat in the key U.S. market during what new CEO Kevin Johnson described as "a very difficult period for many brick-and-mortar retailers." Image source: Getty Images. On the bright side, Starbucks said operating trends in the U.S improved throughout the quarter. Additionally, the company is "seeing further acceleration into April," Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw explained in a press release. Those recent trends are giving executives confidence that growth will speed up over the next two quarters to allow the beverage giant to meet its long-term annual growth goals despite industry challenges. Starbucks aims to boost sales by 10% annually as earnings rise by 15% to 20%, but through the first half of fiscal 2017, revenue is up just 6% and profit is running 14% higher.

Is Rightly Excited for the Future After another strong quarter and striking a deal in its antitrust case with Google, the Russian internet search leader can't wait to move forward. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Apr 28, 2017 at 4:48PM Yandex N.V. (NASDAQ:YNDX) announced exceptional first-quarter 2017 results on Thursday, highlighted by a recent antitrust deal with Google, stabilizing market share in its core search segment, and strong growth from its various other business units. With shares closing up more than 10% yesterday as the market absorbed the news, let's take a closer look at how the Russian internet search specialist kicked off the year, and at what investors can expect from the company going forward. Yandex's antitrust settlement with Google should help it take market share on Android in Russia. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES Yandex results: The raw numbers Metric Q1 2017 Q1 2016 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue 20.652 billion RUR 16.473 billion RUR 25.4% Net income 819 billion RUR 1,069 billion RUR (23.4%) Earnings per share (diluted) 2.54 RUR 3.31 RUR (23.3%) Figures in Russian rubles. Data source: Yandex N.V.  What happened with Yandex this quarter? Revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs (ex-TAC) -- which Yandex compares to sales commissions -- increased 28%, to 16.7 billion RUR. Adjusted net income -- which excludes items like stock-based compensation -- rose 18%, to 3.7 billion RUR. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBTIDA) grew 19%, to 6.9 billion RUR. Yandex's desktop browser share climbed two percentage points to 23% from last quarter, while mobile browser share rose one percentage point sequentially, to 12%. Search queries in Russia increased 2% year over year. Revenue on a segment basis included: 23% growth in search and portal revenue, to 18.656 billion RUR. 24% growth from e-commerce, to 1.295 billion RUR. 75% growth in taxi revenue, to 778 million RUR. 54% growth in classifieds revenue, to 371 million RUR. 76% growth in "experiments" revenue, to 326 million RUR, driven by services including KinoPoisk, Yandex.Music, Yandex.Afisha, and Yandex.TV. Online advertising revenue grew 23% year over year, to 19.515 billion RUR, including 26% growth from Yandex properties, to 14.356 billion RUR, and 17% growth from ad network partners, to 5.159 billion RUR. Non-advertising revenue grew 77% year over year, to 1.137 billion RUR, primarily driven -- as usual -- by Yandex.Taxi. Earlier this month, Yandex and the Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) reached a settlement with Google in their antitrust case, through which Google has "agreed to take significant steps to open up its Android platform in Russia." What management had to say Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh elaborated: The recently announced settlement between Yandex, Google, and the FAS will provide real choice to users and move us closer to a level playing field in Russia. We expect this will open the door to market share gains on mobile in 2017 and beyond. "Continued investments and innovation in the core search business and our business units are delivering results," added Yandex COO Alexander Shulgin. "I am particularly excited about Yandex.Taxi which delivered 484% growth in rides in Q1." Looking forward As it stands, Yandex anticipates full-year 2017 revenue will climb in the range of 17% to 20% year over year, representing an increase to its previous guidance for 16% to 19% growth. Given Yandex's broad-based growth this quarter, its freshly boosted outlook, and its favorable antitrust settlement with Google, Yandex investors have every right to celebrate with shares hovering near 52-week highs today.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email When you think of a digital assistant that’s ready to help you with all your shopping needs, Amazon Echo is probably the first device that springs to mind. But there’s another smart home aide in town, and it’s also ready to get some items shipped straight to your door. Google Home Google Home Review Google Home Review Google Home is a personal assistant smart speaker, and comes from a company that literally knows everything. The $130 Google device answers questions, controls your smart home, and plays music. Should you buy one? Read More is branching out beyond just serving as a smart, all-knowing orb. This device is already useful for delivering answers about who is winning the day’s sports games or serving the latest headlines. There’s still some time to go before the two systems reach parity, as Google’s shopping platform (named “Google Express”) doesn’t have nearly the reach and logistical perfection as Amazon’s ecosystem. However, if you are already living in a Google-centric ecosystem or like being at the cutting edge of new tech,  you may want to give Google Home a try. These steps will help you make sure that you get the most out of your experience. Get Started First, if you want to shop with your Google Home, you need to ensure that your Personal Results setting is on. To do this, go to Menu > More Settings > Adjust Settings for this Google Home Device > Personal Results and ensure that the slider under Personal Results is slid to the right. Next, the tragic reality of online shopping: you need to attach a credit card to your Google account so that Google knows where to send the bill. Touch the slide-out settings panel, and scroll down to Payments. Touch here to enter your credit card information and delivery address. The credit card number you enter is the card that Google Home will automatically bill. Don’t worry, there are still several prompts to get through before you part with your hard-earned money. Additionally, be sure to verify that your delivery address is correct. You can always return to this section in the app at a later date if you wish to change your credit card or address. Make a List As any experienced shopper knows, inspiration can strike at any time. This can be frustrating when you’re out and about, away from that handy Google Home. Thankfully, Google Home also offers a shopping list feature, where you can keep track of the items that you’re considering purchasing. This lets you carefully consider your options or wait for a sale without losing the item to the depths of the internet.  This feature is very important, so take a few minutes to learn where your shopping list is and how you can add items to it. Your shopping list is part of the Home app (it used to be located in Google Keep 4 Google Keep Tips And Tricks For Better Notes, Lists And To-Dos 4 Google Keep Tips And Tricks For Better Notes, Lists And To-Dos Read More ). You can add items by voice from Google Home or any Android smartphone that’s enabled with the Google Assistant How to Get Google Assistant on Non-Pixel Phones How to Get Google Assistant on Non-Pixel Phones Google's new Assistant is only available on Pixel phones, but here's a tweak that lets you enable it on any rooted phone running Android 7.0 or newer. Read More . To access your shopping list at any time, open the Google Home app, touch the slide-out menu, and then select shopping list. You can type items here to add them to the list. It’s even easier to just ask the Google Assistant for help — at any time a simple command (such as “OK Google, add tissues to my shopping list”) will easily add the product to your list. You’ll also notice there’s a spot at the bottom of the list that invites you to get shopping. Touch the “shop your list” button to be taken to a page that lists prices for items that can be found on Google Express. If you’ve compiled a lengthy list of items, there’s a good chance you may find them in Google’s storefront using your phone or computer. But as convenient as it is to peruse these items online, the real magic of Google Home is based on what you could do with your voice. Time to Buy Google Express partners with several different retailers, so finding an item is a little more complicated than just buying something through Amazon Secrets Of The Amazon: 7 Useful Amazon Tips & Tricks Secrets Of The Amazon: 7 Useful Amazon Tips & Tricks Amazon is, without a doubt, one of the best and most popular places to shop online.

But with some patience you can easily find a solid slate of options, depending upon what you’re looking to buy. The best way to get started is by asking the Google Assistant for something innocuous, like paper towels. When I did that, this is the response I received: Another offer came my way after turning this one down. Google will continue to cycle through deals from different retailers as available. When you hear one you like, reply “Yes” to schedule your order. Google Home will verbally confirm your purchase, and you will also receive a confirmation email with your purchase details. At this point in time there is no way to cancel an order from your Google Home. As well, you cannot currently edit an order after placing it. Instead, you must cancel the order and then place a new one with the correct items. To do either of these tasks, you will need to log in to your Google Express account on your mobile device or computer. The Fine Print After you place your order, Google Express (the company’s home delivery service) takes over for delivery. Because this system is still under development, be sure to check whether delivery is available in your area before you get too excited about how much shopping you can do from the couch. With Alexa Alexa Can Now Order Takeout From Amazon Alexa Can Now Order Takeout From Amazon You can now order a takeaway meal from Amazon Restaurants using nothing other than Alexa and your own voice. Which is perfect for those people who are too lazy to cook. Read More , you have to be quite specific about the types of items you’re ordering. If you want a certain model of a product, or a particular color, you must be very specific. On the other hand, Google Assistant is quick to walk you through the different models available when given a general statement. That being said, it can take some patience to wait for your preferred item to appear in Google’s list. As tech executives are fond of saying, it’s certainly early days for shopping on Google Home. The service still feels very rudimentary with the back and forth conversation required. In addition, you can only order one item at a time, so if you want two rolls of paper towel you have to have the conversation twice. And unlike with Amazon, there isn’t yet a dedicated section for items that you want to regularly refill like Amazon’s Dash buttons The 5 Best Hacks for Your Amazon Dash Buttons The 5 Best Hacks for Your Amazon Dash Buttons Amazon's Dash Buttons cost just $5 each, and can be hacked to do all sorts of fun tasks when pressed. Here's how to get started, along with some of the best hacks. Read More . The best way to really test out Google Home’s shopping experience is to add a number of items to your shopping list throughout the day. Then you’ll have a good batch of merchandise to use for exploring what can actually be found with Google Home. Forgot what you added to your shopping list at 2AM last night? A simple “OK Google, What’s on my shopping list?” will prompt your device to list off everything that’s currently on the list. Time to Shop? With Amazon’s long-time dominance in both e-commerce and shopping, Google surely has a tough road ahead. Google may want to become the future of voice-controlled smart home shopping, but there is still some significant progress required before they’ll be able to claim that title. What do you think of this new way to shop? Have you used either device in your everyday life? We’d love to hear about your experiences in the comments!

And now it has a new trick up its sleeve… Google Home Frees Your Hands With a little help from Bon Appetit, The Food Network, and The New York Times, to name just three, Google Home can now read out step-by-step cooking instructions for any of over 5 million recipes. Which, seeing as cooking requires the use of two hands, could be insanely useful. The first thing you need to do is find a recipe you want to follow. You can find one online using Google Assistant or Google Search. Once you’ve found one, click “Send to Google Home” to save your recipe. Then, when you’re ready to start cooking, say, “OK Google, start cooking”. You can then gather your ingredients together and prepare to start cooking. Google Home will read the first step, and give you time to catch up. When you’re ready to move on just say, “OK Google, next step”. Or, if you need the last step repeating, say, “OK Google, repeat”. Repeat this process until you’ve heard every step of the recipe and you should, with some luck, have produced something tasty. Or at least edible.

The internet has changed and evolved ever since it's ancestors first came to life in the late 1960's. Some technology fades away and is forgotten; other aspects continue but are overlaid, like geological sediments, so that they are now longer visible but are still present under the surface. The Domain Name System — both the technology of DNS and the deployed naming hierarchy we all use — are among those aspects of the internet that, although they feel solid and immutable, are slowly changing underneath our feet. Act I: In Which DNS Fades to Translucent Grey Internet Domain Names had a good twenty-year run from the early days of the World Wide Web (1995) through 2015. Some people made a lot of money through domain name speculation. Others made money by wallpapering Google Ad Sense advertisements over vacuous websites. And a busload of attorneys made a good living chasing down shysters trying to make a buck off of the trademarks of others. And through its perceived control of domain name policy, ICANN grew into a ever-bloating, money absorbing bureaucracy worthy of Jonathan Swift. But things are changing. The days of domain names as the center of internet policy and internet governance are ending. Domain name speculation will slowly become a quaint shadow of its former self. What is driving these changes? It is not that the Domain Name System (DNS) is becoming less important as a technical way of mapping structured names into various forms of records, most often records containing IP addresses. Nor is the Domain Name System used less then heretofore. Nor are the knights of intellectual property becoming any less enthusiastic about challenging every domain name that they feel does not pay adequate homage to the trademarks they are protecting. And national governments continue to believe that domain names are the holy grail of levers they can use to impose their views of right and proper behavior onto the internet. All of that remains. And it will remain. What is happening to DNS is more subtle: Domain names are slowly becoming invisible. For many years internet users could not avoid domain names. DNS names were highly visible. And domain names were everywhere. DNS names were part of e-mail addresses, DNS names were prominent parts of World Wide Web URLs, and DNS names that were based on words formed a rough, but useful, taxonomy of web content. But the sea-level of internet technology is slowly rising. We now live in a world of web search engines. We now have personalized lists of "contacts". We now use a profusion of "apps". And we now spend much of our online lives inside walled gardens and social networks (such as Facebook, Twitter, or various games.) Even in places where users formerly uttered or typed email-addresses (containing domain names) or web addresses, we now enter keystrokes or words that are used by user interface code to search for the thing we want and make suggestions. For example, when I send an e-mail, I usually don't need to type more than two or three characters of the name of the desired recipient; for every keystroke the software goes to my contact list, does a search, and shows me the possible outcomes. Similarly, on web browsers the old "address bar" has become a place for the user to send search targets to a web search company. In both of these examples the user no longer really deals with domain names (even though in both of these examples there are domain names — sometimes visible, sometimes hidden — underneath the search results.) In the world of Apps, games, and walled gardens there may not even be a way for a user to utter a domain name. And if a user does mention a domain name it is frequently in the form of a shortened URL that has no resemblance to the actual domain name of the target resource. You can confirm this by asking yourself: "When was last time I used a domain name while using Facebook or Twitter, or when playing my favorite game?" Few of us have ever used a domain name when giving an order to an Amazon Echo ("Alexa") or a Google Home ("OK Google"). Act II: DNS Remains, But Quietly Hovers In The Background DNS is not being abandoned; the domain name system is as robust, powerful, and important today as it ever was. However, DNS is being veiled. So that rather than being a central figure, visible to all, it does its job behind the scenes where few but internet operators and repair techs see it. In days past, you or I may have gone to a web browser and entered a URL that looked like, http://upstairs-thermostat.myhouse.tld/. But today I use an Internet of Things device and say "Alexa, set the upstairs thermostat to 68 degrees." Same activity, same request, same devices, but the domain name has gone away and been replaced with a more convenient handle. I use the word "handle" quite intentionally. One of the aspects of the post-DNS internet is that names are becoming contextual. These new names often exist within the context of a particular person (as in a personal contact list) or a particular walled garden (such as Twitter). Contextual names let us escape the rules and disputes — and costs — that came from the "globally unique identifier" view of the domain name system. You and I can each use the name "upstairs thermostat"; the context prevents collisions; the context differentiates between your "upstairs thermostat" and mine. These new names will often be used on software that internally uses domain names to tie things together. There is no doubt that Twitter, for example, has lots of internal domain names. But those domain names have become merely internal gears and wheels, they have become as invisible as the pistons in the motor of a gasoline powered automobile. The DNS system will remain as a means of using structured names — words connected by dots — to obtain various forms of records that can contain things as varied as IP addresses, geographic locations, e-mail exchange server lists, VoIP PBX locations, etc. But it will be software rather than humans that originates those structured names and uses the lookup results. That software may, and frequently will not, make those underlying structured DNS names, or the lookup results, visible to the human user. The fading of domain names brings benefits. Some troublesome things will begin to end. Domain names will no longer be perceived as being particularly valuable ways to express semantically meaningful labels. This will remove much of the energy that powered the DNS trademark wars that we have seen over the past twenty years. (But don't expect the trademark protection industry to give up their relentless effort to own even private, local uses of some names — that company in Atlanta will probably want to try to prevent people in their own homes from using the word "coke" to refer to any brown carbonated sugar drink other than their own.) And it will also tend to de-energize marginal internet activities such as typosquatting in order to pick up advertising impressions or click dollars from people who accidentally mis-typed a domain name into a browser. And it will obviate the need for most of the functions of ICANN. Opportunities will arise for application-specific or community specific naming systems: New names can be more descriptive of classes of possible targets rather than being tightly bound: You could, for example, say "ATM" and not be locked into ATMs operated by wellsfargo.com. New names do not need to fit into the confined strictures of domain names. New names need to be less like "names" and more like "descriptions" — more on that below. Act III: There’s Still Gold In Internet Naming The loss of domain names as baubles for speculation does not mean that entrepreneurs and Procrustean government bureaucrats must fold their tends and skulk away in to the night. Even after DNS becomes merely an internal organ of the internet, there will be plenty of opportunities for fun and profit. Companies that are presently operating as domain name registries and registrars, are well poised to capitalize on the new systems: they already have much of the customer and user facing "front office" infrastructure that will be required to service whatever naming systems may arise. There are two broad areas in which internet naming will probably evolve: entity naming and describing. Entity Naming The need to attach names to specific things will be with us forever. And there will always be a need to turn names into some sort of concrete handle to those things. This will be, as it always has been, tied to the problems of figuring out where that thing is (i.e. its address) and how to get there (i.e. the route.) One of the prime values of DNS as it exists today is that almost everybody voluntary chooses to use a single base root. So we have a global shared system that assures that all names attached to that root are unique. That uniqueness is important, but it is not always necessary — sometimes people want a solid distributed name-to-record lookup system that is not dependent on a global root outside of their control. Sometimes people just want a private name space for some private purpose. DNS technology, as opposed to "the" domain name system, provides a useful tool for these purposes. The name model of DNS is extremely useful, but it is simplistic: It is a hierarchy, represented by names separated by dots, that leads to sets of records that can contain various types of data. That simplicity has allowed DNS to be robust and reliable. But that same simplicity creates limits. The world is evolving so that that simple model of names-to-records will become increasingly inadequate. I've written a couple of papers on this topic: On Entity Associations In A Cloud Network – The argument made here is that as we move towards cloud based resources the simple mapping of DNS names to a relatively fixed set of answers is not sufficient to accommodate the motion, partitioning, and coalescing of cloud based computing and data resources. Thoughts On Internet Naming Systems ‐ This presentation addresses certain presumed characteristics of domain names that are not necessarily true in practice and likely to become even less true in the future. For example, many of us tend to presume that DNS names will generate the same answers no matter who requests a DNS lookup. And all of us are increasingly aware that DNS names are not permanent, the underlying records, and sometimes even the DNS names themselves, sometimes change or even disappear. And even though name-to-record look machinery such as DNS will remain valuable, it must evolve so that it can have greater security and consistency. The larger area of future change lies in the area described by the first of the papers above — in the realm of lookups based on descriptions and attributions. Attribute and Description Based Systems Whether in real life or on the internet, often you want something that is a member of a class rather than a specific member of that class. You often just want "a Pepsi" rather than a specific bottle of that drink; you usually don't care which bottle for your needs, the various bottles are equivalent and interchangeable. A word for this is "fungible". As is described in my paper On Entity Associations In A Cloud Network the internet is evolving so that there may be many resources that would satisfy any one of our (or our application's) needs. DNS is often not the best solution for this kind of resource search. Attribute and description based systems would be better, particularly if they had some leeway to find things that are "near" or "similar to" the description or attributes. We are familiar with this kind of search. For example, web search engines, such as Google, try to show us web search results that locate the best or nearest solutions, not necessarily the perfect solution. And many apps on mobile devices aspire to discover resources based on their distance to your current location. We can anticipate that use of this kind of thing will increase. Descriptions and attributes can be self-published by devices and services as they are deployed (or as cloud entities split or coalesce) or they can be published by those who manage such devices or services. This publication could be in the form of simple ad hoc text, as is done for much that is on the web, or be formalized into machine-readable data structures in JSON or XML. There is lots of room for innovation in this realm; and possibly lots of room to glue-on revenue producing machinery, much as Google did when it attached advertising to web searching. Epilogue: The Internet Twenty Years Hence (2037) Relatively few of us remember the internet as it was twenty years ago when the World Wide Web was just getting started. What will it look like twenty years in the future? We can be sure that whatever it looks like to users, that there will be a lot of ancient machinery, such as DNS, lurking inside. It is likely that human users will increasingly interact with computer and networks resources much as they interact with other humans — in ad hoc and informal ways. Humans are notoriously vague and ambiguous; that will not change in the future. This means that our computerized systems will have to become more human in the ways that they resolve that ambiguity into concrete results and actions. This, in turn, means that computerized systems will have to become more aware of context and use fewer "names" and more "descriptions" when trying to satisfy human requests. The introduction of context into network naming will mean more opportunities for damage to human privacy. The tension between convenience and privacy will increase. As the network world becomes more contextual, it will become harder to diagnose and isolate problems and failures. Footnote: What Do We Do With An ICANN That Has Lost Most Of Its Purpose? The vast bulk of ICANN's machinery and staff is present to support the domain name selling industry. As this paper indicates, we can anticipate that that industry will shrink and consolidate. And fights over domain names will fade as domain names lose their semantic weight or become hidden artifacts rarely seen by anyone except internet technicians. The ICANN traveling circus of international meetings will become as interesting as a meeting about the future of Lotus 123. ICANN's income stream will shrink; ICANN will no longer be able to support its grandiose office suites, staff, and hyperbolic procedures. ICANN will have to retreat back to what it should have been in the first place — a technical coordinator, a source of operational service levels for DNS roots and TLD servers, and secretariat for protocol parameters such as DNSSEC keys and IP protocol numbers.

The chief executive officer of the search-engine unit received $199.7 million in compensation for 2016, according to a regulatory filing Friday. That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay -- a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud. He oversaw a 17.8 percent jump in Google’s core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai’s 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job. The award was granted about six months after the tech business announced it would reorganize into holding company Alphabet. As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity. It wasn’t the first time following in Page’s footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice president of products and took over many of Page’s responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid U.S. executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn’t required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don’t reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn’t disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The Mountain View, California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said “encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business.” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat got a $39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION Why Waymo’s self-driving car test in Phoenix is such a big milestone John Brandon@jmbrandonbb April 28, 2017 2:10 PM Above: Waymo Image Credit: Waymo Artificial intelligence is not the savior of mankind. All of the intelligence we program into an interface — a speaker like Amazon Echo, the chatbot you use at work, or a car that drives on its own — has to be tested in the real world by actual human beings, and until those tests are perfected, it won’t be saving anyone. Even then, this computer entity is really an extension of the human mind, isn’t it? An AI is only as smart as the humans who create and program it — nothing more and nothing less. That’s why autonomous cars are so important. They won’t be the savior of all mankind, but the AI in cars will certainly save a few lives — perhaps even millions. That’s why the recent news that Waymo (the sister company of Google) is using a fleet of 500 test vehicles — the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, outfitted with LIDAR sensors and other tech to keep the car on the straight and narrow — is so important. No autonomous car will ever reach full production standards at larger automakers like Chrysler and GM until there are real people sitting in the vehicle — including kids, as Google’s Waymo has explained. Here’s why that is. Every expert in the auto industry knows there are millions of variables when it comes to driving, and an AI has to collect and analyze all of that data. That’s why it is called machine learning, not machine learned. A cat and a dog run into the road at the same time; what does the car need to do? Five cars swerve around an object on a highway. Why? At high speeds, wind comes up from a valley and sweeps over the road, but at the same time, there’s a draft from a storm on the other side — one that happens once every year. How should the car react? Self-driving cars need the full force of a major tech company in order to discern how an AI will function in all of these conditions. Have you met any government regulators? They are not going to let cars drive on their own in every state on every road anytime soon, although Las Vegas and San Francisco seem fairly open to the idea in some areas. Tesla is beta-testing autonomous cars with real drivers, but Tesla is a tiny startup compared to Ford. There’s a risk of reputation, not from the handful of self-driving cars Ford might release a few years from now but to the millions of cars they sell without that tech. And there’s this fact. Early adopters all have one thing in common: They are a small minority. The major automakers don’t want to sell to a small number of early adopters, they want to sell to your Aunt Judy who drives to work in a Honda Civic today. Mass production of AI-enabled vehicles requires mass testing with hundreds or even thousands of drivers. There’s a lesson there for anyone creating a chatbot or AI-enabled software: Test it for Aunt Judy. Your AI should have so much data to analyze, go through so many rounds of usability testing, and work with an incredible number of users at all levels of technical ability that it’s almost foolproof. What happens when you don’t test in the real world? An AI will crash and fail. It will lose market share. It will become Microsoft Tay. Google and Waymo are testing 500 minivans because they are thinking about production scale artificial intelligence in cars. That’s the real goal.
CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google’s Android updates policy needs a big makeover Chris Davies - Apr 28, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit No device lives forever, particularly not smartphones where what’s on the cutting edge seems to dull within months, but Google’s end-of-life announcement for the Pixel still surprises. The handset – still so popular months after its release, indeed, that Google’s online store struggles to keep it in stock – may be facing replacement at the hand of the Pixel 2 later this year, but for the moment it’s still the company’s flagship Android device. So it’s not too surprising that owners have been dumbfounded this week by Google’s scant commitment to software updates in the years ahead. “Pixel phones get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device first became available on the Google Store,” the company has confirmed. “After 2 years, we can’t guarantee additional updates.” That means, come October 2018, you won’t necessarily be getting whichever shiny new version of Android that is getting Google I/O attendees so excited. It’s a little better for security updates, but only by twelve months. Google says that its Pixel phones are eligible “for at least 3 years” of such updates from the point where the device first went on sale, or at least 18 months from when it was last sold by the company’s own store, whichever is the longer. “After that,” by which Google means October 2019, “we can’t guarantee additional updates.” It’s hard not to look across the aisle to what Apple is doing with the iPhone, and contrast that with Google’s commitment. The iPhone 5, for instance, was released all the way back in 2012, an age in smartphone years. Nonetheless, when iOS 10 was released in September 2016, it was on the list of supported devices. One of the benefits of Apple tightly integrating its software with its hardware – to the point where it designs its own chipsets – has always been its efficiency. Most of the time, that manifests as phones that run more smoothly in everyday life, even if they may not have the same underlying potency as devices on rival platforms. Yet Apple’s ability to keep aging handsets up to date with modern software releases is equally impressive. No, the iPhone 5 didn’t have every single one of the whiz-bang features that the iPhone 6s got with iOS 10. Yet the fundamentals were there: the security updates and the performance improvements. Whether or not you’re a fan of iPhone specifically or Apple in general, it’s hard to argue against the idea that the Cupertino company is handling its updates better than its rivals in Mountain View. Google has left itself some wiggle-room, certainly. There are “no guaranteed” updates to Android for the Pixel and Pixel XL after October 2018; “no guaranteed” updates to security after October 2019. It could, were it feeling generous, surprise and delight Pixel owners with an unexpected late refresh: an Android update out of the goodness of its own collective heart. NOW READ: The Pixel 2 may come in XXL size All the same, it’s hard to recommend devices to people when their longer-term security and functionality is dependent on the whim of its creators. It’s a situation that affects you whether you keep your phone for the typical two years or until it dies a natural death. Either you’ll be trying to sell on a phone that’s no longer eligible for software updates, or using one that could be leaving you open to security issues. The narrative around the Pixel series – and the Nexus devices before it – was that Google was using it to model best behavior for other Android OEMs. If this is how committed Google is to its expensive flagships, though, it’s a lesson I hope other smartphone manufacturers choose not to learn. Am I being unfair on Google? Is two years a reasonable expectation for OS upgrades? Let me know what you think in the comments!

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Classroom now lets you create your own classes By Ida Torres - April 28, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Just last month, Google opened its Classroom service, allowing those who do not have G Suite for Education accounts to still join and even teach classes, manage assignments and collaborate with other teachers and students. Now they’re going one step further by allowing anyone with a Google account to create classes and invite people to be part of it. You can set up and manage either or both online and in-person classes and it can range from classes for adult education, hobbies, after school programs, and special interests. Google invited some teachers and students to pilot the program and they are now sharing some of the classes that were created and participated in. For example, educator Tony Vincent created a free online class for teaching graphic design using Google Drawings and 75 teachers all over the world joined. He used videos to teach then gave the students a week to submit assignments, and there was constant communication through posts, emails, reminders, etc. An elementary school teacher used Classroom for her Girl Scots robotics club to share and access resources, comment and share ideas, and collaborate on projects, as part of their after school program. A student from Brazil used the service to manage their school club called GameDev Society UFRGS as they discussed design, art, and programming. So basically, any class that you want to teach or club that you want to manage can now be created through Google Classroom. As long as you have a Google account and you have a plan, resources, materials, etc, then you’re good to go.

The tech giants were victims of an email phishing attack that was allegedly perpetrated by Lithuanian Evaldas Rimasauskas. Pen pals finally meet after sending handwritten letters for 42 years It was revealed in March the 48-year-old had been charged over the offence but the names of the two companies involved were kept a secret. Rimasauskas was accused of tricking Facebook and Google into wiring him money from 2013 to 2015 after posing as a manufacturer from Asia. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said last month: ‘Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multi million-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company.’ MORE: Man charged with murdering ex-Royal Navy officer Mike Samwell Facebook and Google did not reveal the exact amount of money that was stolen from them (Picture: AFP/Getty Images) The emails were made to look as though they came from inside the tech firms and Rimasauskas had also forged documents to help him with the con, according to the DoJ. A Google spokeswoman said: ‘We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities.’ ‘We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved.’ A spokeswoman for Facebook added: ‘Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.’ The tech companies did not reveal the amount of money that was stolen from them.

Rather than wasting any time, she decided to send Google CEO Sundar Pichai a letter to let him know that she’s planning on working there one day. She got two things in return: A lovely letter from Pichai encouraging her to follow her dreams, and a paid job testing tech products for a tech startup based in London. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 “Dear Google boss,” Young Bridgewater’s letter begins. “May name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with Google.” She goes on to explain that she’s also planning on swimming in the Olympics and working at a chocolate factory, because what kid doesn’t dream of that? Her love of Google centers around its work culture, which includes kid-friendly bonuses like working from a bean bag or making your way from one floor of the company’s headquarters to another via slide. After her father posted a photo of her letter online it quickly went viral, catching the attention of Kano, the built-it-yourself computer startup that crushed its crowdfunding goals back in late 2013 and has been shipping its kits ever since. Now, the 7-year-old and her younger sister, Hollie, help Kano test new products ahead of time, giving the company feedback on what works and what doesn’t. The two girls were even added as board members of Kano’s product innovation board.

Is Google testing its own jobs search engine? In the market for a new job? Google appears to be testing a new search feature just for you. Barry Schwartz on April 28, 2017 at 2:55 pm More Google seems to be testing a new search feature. This one is designed to help searchers find new job openings. Dan Shure spotted this test for queries on Google that include [jobs online], [data entry jobs online], [newbury street jobs] and so on. Google shows job listings and takes you into what appears to be their very own job search portal to drill down deeper. Here are some screen shots of the job search results in the core web results: After you click on “more jobs,” it takes you into this jobs-specific search results interface that gives you additional filters for job categories, titles, dates, types, state, city, company type and employer. The interface looks a little bit like the local results interface, with the listings down the left-hand side and results in the middle. This story is developing, and we will update it as we have more information from Google. As we wrote earlier today, Google performed 9,800 live traffic experiments last year; this is just one of the many new ones. Postscript: A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land “while we don’t have any news to announce at this time, we’re always looking for new ways to improve the Search experience for our users, whether they’re looking for movies to see, recipes to make, or job opportunities.” About The Author Barry Schwartz Barry Schwartz is Search Engine Land's News Editor and owns RustyBrick, a NY based web consulting firm.

Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released. Stocks Soar, Then Hold Gains The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests. Amazon Is E-Commerce, Cloud King The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years. Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth. Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks. Alphabet Hits New High On Earnings The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's "other" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday. McDonald's, Domino's Earnings Deliver; Starbucks Iced McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level. Microsoft Earnings Solid; Sales, Guidance Shy Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion. Intel Tumbles Amid Mixed Chip Week Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results. Defense Stocks Are In Buy DMZ Zone Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees "significant demand signals" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas. Boeing Sales Miss, Cash Flow Triples Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose. Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range. Hard Drives Split Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday. Casino Stocks Are Winners Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation. Exxon, Chevron Earnings Top Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains. T-Mobile Keeps Grabbing Customers T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low. Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains. Autos' Earnings Better Than Expected Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices. Caterpillar Earnings Crush Views Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone. Drug, Biotech Earnings Bonanza Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed. Insurers Navigate Earnings, TrumpCare Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that "20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid." Homebuilder Stocks Now Lagging PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.   Share this: Related news Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action Plan 4/28/2017 Some of the most closely watched and high-profile tech companies — Apple, Tesla and Facebook — report quarterly results as... 4/28/2017 Some of the most closely watched and high-profile tech companies...

Inbound Horizons Is Helping Make That Possible Why Not Do Breakfast With Google For National Small Business Week? Inbound Horizons Is Helping Make That Possible Posted on April 28, 2017 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. Business owners in Buda, TX have a chance during National Small Business Week to catch a free breakfast and chat directly with Google, courtesy of Inbound Horizons, a Texas-based marketing agency. Topics include how to help customers find their business on the web in 2017 and the latest small business search trends. Buda, TX (PRWEB) April 28, 2017 Business owners in Buda, TX have a chance during National Small Business Week to catch a free breakfast and chat directly with Google. A Texas-based marketing agency, Inbound Horizons, is making it happen by coordinating with the search-giant Google for the event on May 4th, 2017. Inbound Horizons, a Google Partner Agency since 2012, invited Google to telecast a live video conference in Buda, TX for small business week. The event allows business owners to talk directly with Google staff about how to improve their business on the web, and get advice on how to help local customers find them more easily. “We’re just glad Google agreed to schedule the event during small business week,” Daniel Sem, the CEO of Inbound Horizons, said. “I think this really gives small businesses the message that they matter, even to a huge company like Google, and they still have a big part to play in the 2017 economy!” The event begins with a live video presentation by Google staff, followed by an interactive question and answer session for business owners. Representatives from Inbound will also be present to help business owners with free consultations on improving their online business presence for 2017. “Probably the biggest question people will have is ‘how can I get on the number one search page’” Sem said, smiling. “But I think after chatting with Google they’ll see there is a whole lot more than just that to think about on the web today!” The event is open to any business owner or representative. Breakfast is free to all attendees and free Google give-aways will be provided by the search company. Due to limited seating capacity at the event venue, attendees must RSVP by calling 210-556-3050 by May 3rd, 2017. The event begins at 9:00am and ends approximately 10:30am the morning of May 4th, 2017. It will be hosted in the Buda Comfort Suites conference room, address 15295 S IH 35 Frontage Rd, Buda, TX 78610.

In earnings calls this week, Google says it has developed 'deep enterprise' strengths and Microsoft says it's executing on digital transformations thanks to the cloud. Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 29 April, 2017 05:48 - - - - print email Comments Google and Microsoft are both benefiting from solid growth in enterprise cloud services. Both companies released earnings reports this week that highlighted significant momentum in G Suite, Office Suite, respectively, and more sophisticated cloud platforms for business. “We crossed a major milestone with more than 100 million monthly active users of Office 365 commercial,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during a conference call. “Office 365 commercial seats grew 35 percent year-over-year and revenue is up 45 percent.” Microsoft also reported a 15 percent year-over-year gain in revenue from Office 365 and other consumer products. The company ended the quarter with 26.2 million Office 365 consumer subscribers. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, declined to disclose revenue from Google Cloud, but CFO Ruth Porat described the business as a major growth engine and “one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet,” during the earnings call. Google Cloud growing faster than ad business Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Google Cloud also represented the largest growth in headcount and capital expense during the quarter. “People sense our commitment to the area. They understand the pace at which we are investing, they see that we are committed to machine learning and [artificial intelligence] at a deep level,” he said during the call. “I think there is a very strong recognition that we have pivoted to being a deep enterprise company, and our conversations are very strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies… I can see a qualitative lead and momentum there.” [ Related: G Suite vs. Office 365 cloud collaboration battle heats up ] Google Cloud revenue is grouped with hardware, Google Play and “other” businesses, so it’s not clear how much Google’s cloud business contributed to the segment’s $3.1 billion in sales during the quarter. Revenue from the “other” segment grew faster than Google’s ad business ( jumping 19 percent year-over-year ) but it still pales in comparison to the $21.4 billion Google banked on ads during the quarter. Google Cloud’s reorganization under senior vice president Diane Greene has also impacted how Google pursues opportunities in enterprise. “The heavy lifting, I would say, is around how we meet enterprises in the market,” Pichai said. “We have reorganized so we have one face to the customers” with specialists who can help IT professionals solve difficult tech challenges or implement machine learning to improve efficiency and business outcomes, he said. “When a customer signs up for Google Cloud, they get more than [Google Cloud Platform] and G Suite. They have access to the ads and analytics teams, YouTube teams, and resources within our organization.” Microsoft benefits from hybrid deployments Meanwhile, Microsoft continued to leverage its massive installed base of Office users and the shift to transform businesses around cloud-based infrastructure. “We do have a huge on-premises base,” Nadella told investors. “There is still a need for those on-premises products. That will continue, but our focus is on transitioning to the cloud. And you’ve seen us do this successfully with Office 365.” Revenue from Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, increased 11 percent year-over-year to $6.8 billion. The Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, Dynamics and LinkedIn, climbed 22 percent from a year prior to $7.96 billion. Microsoft’s entire commercial cloud portfolio, which also includes Azure, Office 365, Dynamics as well as other cloud-based services tailored for enterprises, reported a 52 percent year-over-year increase in its annualized revenue run rate to $15.2 billion. [ Related: Trying to make sense of Google’s messaging mess ] Google is also capitalizing on the digital transformation trend, albeit at a much smaller scale than Microsoft “Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-premises data centers to the cloud,” Pichai said. “We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business.” Cloud-based infrastructure, or infrastructure as a service (IaaS), is one of the fastest growing segments in the global cloud market, and is projected to grow 36.8 percent to $34.6 billion in 2017, according to research firm Gartner. Cloud application services, or Software as a Service (SaaS), is projected to jump 20.1 percent to $46.3 billion this year.

Bloomberg’s digital innovation chief, Michael Shane. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) The news industry faces a Herculean challenge. With resources and attention spans dwindling, media organizations find themselves in a with tech titans who have billions of dollars to back their forays into media. What weapon in the journalist’s arsenal could stand up to that? Reclaiming the relationship with readers, says Michael Shane. Shane is the global head of digital innovation for Bloomberg, where he oversees strategy for the news company’s editorial products and business. Before Bloomberg, he helped put The Verge on the map at Vox Media. Shane shared his insights about how journalists can compete in the digital age during a panel at the Society of American Business Editors spring conference in Seattle today. Continue reading for highlights from his talk, including tips for other news publishers as well as insights about Facebook, talent acquisition, and new media. Shane speaks on stage with Retha Hill of the ASU Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) On ‘reclaiming your audience’: “Google and Facebook [are estimated to take] 89 cents of every new dollar in advertising, and others have put the number even higher up to 99 cents out of every new dollar of digital advertising. Really the only way to hedge against that is to reclaim our relationship with users. Because what’s happened is, Google and Facebook, they want to be the internet. The internet is actually everything, but for many people the internet is Facebook. Period. I think we all know people like that. For most of us, it’s probably not like that. We’re journalists. We work in the publishing industry. For us, the internet is a very big and diverse place, generally. But for most people, the internet is essentially some combination of Google and Facebook, probably with a little Amazon thrown in. They have, I think in many sectors, topic areas of publishing, usurped our relationship with the audience. That’s what we have to reclaim. Because that’s how you can build products, news products, that differentiate you from what Facebook and Google offer.” On Bloomberg’s competition strategy: “You’re going to see us start to build products and introduce value for the parts of our audience that tell us that they care about us. So at a tactical level, reclaiming your audience means one thing. I’m usually not this clinical but it means data. It means first-party data. Who are they? Where do they work? How much money do they make? Where do they live? What are they interested in? What’s their role? But that’s special, valuable stuff. People’s information, even anonymized information, including what industry they’re in, their email address even, all that stuff, we have to treat it like the holy of holies. So you have to come from a point of humility if you want to get that stuff.” On local media: “If you’re working at an organization that is focused on the Pacific Northwest, or Texas, or something that’s much more localized, to me that gives you an incredible advantage when you’re thinking about reclaiming that audience because … you have built-in scarcity. Your mission, from the get-go, is not to be all things to all people. Whether you’re in an industry-specific publication or it’s geographical, having those built-in limitations can keep you on the rails and keep you really disciplined and also because you don’t have to worry about being all things to all people — unlike Google and Facebook — you can build products or plan editorial strategies or editorial features, or sales strategies that are totally and completely tuned for your area and your audience.” On Facebook: “What they’ve done, is they have allowed anyone to achieve a level of amplification that is maybe not commensurate with their expertise or the quality of what they’re offering. Here’s the thing: when you look at Facebook and the algorithm, it’s tuned for engagement. It’s looking for signals that mean engagement, and engagement is, at the end of the day, an emotional response from a person. And what is the strongest emotion a person can feel? It is not love. It is not dutiful consideration. It’s not critical thought. It’s outrage. Whether they meant to or not, Facebook has built one of the world’s most powerful algorithms that moves money and markets and shapes the opinions of vast swaths of people is built on outrage. Period.”  Whether they meant to or not, Facebook has built one of the world’s most powerful algorithms that moves money and markets and shapes the opinions of vast swaths of people is built on outrage. Period. On hiring for the newsroom: “I think the best way to have a connection to your audience is to be your audience. And part of that means hiring your audience. If you are doing journalism and you’re selling advertising around journalism and that is happening around digital platforms, there are certain types of people you should look for — and you should be willing to make some non-traditional decisions or think outside the box a little bit … working on the web is a team sport and by definition it’s multidisciplinary. On journalism’s new reality: “You need to look for people who are looking to do more than file a story. When I was at Bloomberg when I first got to the newsroom … I wouldn’t let anyone use the word ‘file.’ I wouldn’t because it doesn’t make any sense. Because that implies an end and on the internet, there is no end. Every story lives forever. And it was a small thing and maybe it was a stupid, persnickety thing but to me, it was important. From a cultural point of view, I really wanted people to think about their work. How it lived and from the point of view of a user.” Monica Nickelsburg handles a variety of editorial roles, including social media, site production, and the Geek Life beat.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Chrome Will Tag HTTP Websites as ‘Not Secure’ in Address Bar Whenever User Enter Details By Zara Ali 12 hours ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Google is working on making its Chrome browser safer for users. The tech giant had been warning websites on using HTTPS instead of HTTP since January this year. Taking another step ahead for security, Chrome has announced that it will mark HTTP pages as “not secure” in the address bar whenever the user enters data on the web page. The company had been using this technique with Chrome 56 that was launched in January this year. It marked HTTP sites “Not secure” whenever user entered password or credit card fields. This step by Google gained 23% decline in the use of such pages on desktops. Related Google Might Bring Its Default Ad-Blocking Feature for Chrome Browser Advertisement In its latest move, the tech giant will show “not-secure.” tag in the address bar for an HTTP site. It will appear whenever the user clicks on any data field to fill details on the website. Earlier, this tag was limited to credit card information and passwords, but now it will apply to all the data fields. In a blog post, Emily Schechter from Chrome Security Team writes: Passwords and credit cards are not the only types of data that should be private. Any type of data that users type into websites should not be accessible to others on the network, so starting in version 62 Chrome will show the “Not secure” warning when users type data into HTTP sites. Same functionality for Incognito Mode The blog post also notes that the same functionality will also be present in the incognito mode on Chrome browser. Google is expected to start rolling out the feature with Chrome 62 update that will arrive in October. With the version 62 of Chrome, Google is eyeing on encouraging more websites to start using HTTPS instead of the unreliable HTTP. The company also says that the transition from HTTP to HTTPS is cheap for the website owners and by doing so, they will also enhance the functionality of their website. Related Chrome 58 Rolling Out to Mac, Windows, & Linux, Lacks Touch Bar Support for MacBook Pro Google’s increased focus on non-secure websites is commendable and we expect that its latest announcement encourages website owners to use HTTPS protocol. Also, we would like to suggest our readers to always check whether a website is using HTTPS prefix, if not then we suggest on not sharing important details on such websites.

Twitter Facebook Google's Chrome will soon start warning you more about HTTP pages Chrome's Incognito mode will label all HTTP pages as 'not secure' starting in October Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 29 April, 2017 05:21 - - - - print email Comments A Google effort to push websites to implement encryption is expanding. Starting in October, the company will roll out new warnings to flag HTTP connections as insecure in its Chrome browser. For users, it means Chrome will display the words “not secure” in the browser’s address bar whenever they type any data into web pages that connect over HTTP. However, for users who like to browse through Chrome’s privacy-enhancing Incognito mode, the warnings will appear by default on all HTTP pages visited, not only when the user enters information onto the page. “Eventually, we plan to show the ‘not secure’ warning for all HTTP pages, even outside Incognito mode,” Google said in a blog post on Thursday. Google Example of how the warnings will appear on Chrome when they go into effect in Oct.  Back in January, Google's Chrome started using its “not secure” label, but only for HTTP pages that contain password or credit card form fields.

To help websites move to HTTPS, Google has produced a set-up guide for interested developers. Mozilla’s Firefox browser has also been taking similar steps to warn users about visiting HTTP sites, too. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Name: Subject: Message: Best Google Home accessories: from lighting, to temperature control and more Newsby Scott Adam Gordon11 hours ago 6 138 21 Google Home is the connected speaker powered by Google Assistant that aims to make your day a little easier. Released in November last year, Google Home helps you find out the local weather, check what’s on your current schedule, get traffic updates and more. It’s the only real competitor to the Amazon Echo right now and both are vying or a place in your household. Google Home review But Google Home isn’t just there to answer questions, it’s also a way to control your household using your voice. In this article, we’re focusing not just on the Google Home’s native functionality, but at how it can be more than it already is. Join us now as we explore the best Google Home accessories, and if you’re looking for all the compatible Google Home services, visit our dedicated article at the link. Editor’s Note: Anybody who has read our best Amazon Echo accessories will see some crossover between the products. The market is still young, folks, there isn’t a great deal of competition among smart devices currently. Best Google Home accessory Chromecast: $35-$69 Chromecasts and Google Home go together like pancakes and even more pancakes. They aren’t just the best Google Home accessories in a specific category — they are the best Google Home accessories. The Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, and Chromecast Ultra are gadgets that connect your TV or stereo system to your smartphone. Content can then be streamed directly from your phone to one of these devices, breathing new life into old products or just expanding the possibilities of current gen devices. The Chromecasts and Google Home rely on the same Google Home app to operate and, consequently, work harmoniously together. You can use them to conduct searches for movies, TV shows and actors; browse and cast content from Chromecast-enabled apps like YouTube; play, pause and change the volume of music that you’re streaming and more — all with the power of your voice. Of course, to make the most of them, it would be beneficial to have subscriptions to relevant content providers like Netflix, Spotify, Google Play Music or similar, but it’s not strictly necessary. If you’re interested in adding some interesting, low-cost voice control to your TV or speakers, these are a must. Chromecast and Chromecast audio review Best Google Home smart thermostat Nest 3rd generation learning thermostat: $249 The Nest is basically the smart thermostat product right now. It comes from a great pedigree, the company was launched by former Apple employees before Google purchased it several years ago (it now operates under Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc). Now in its third iteration, the reason that the Nest thermostat is such a great product is that it learns from your behaviour. I know people who spend whole days adjusting the thermostat settings in their apartment, but the Nest uses intelligent algorithms to help avoid this. Play with it for a couple of weeks, changing its temperature settings periodically as you normally would, and watch how it becomes trained to recreate your preferences automatically. And when it does need manual adjustment, why not use Google Home? By pairing these devices you can ask Google to set your Nest to a specific temperature, raise it or lower by a certain number of degrees, as well as get it to confirm what the current temperature is in one of your rooms. The Nest also has a proximity sensor which will activate the device when you walk by, displaying temperature, time or even weather information, and it can provide an energy usage history from its dedicated app. It’s a brilliant overall package. Best Google Home smart light bulb The Philips Hue A19 white starter kit: $69.99 (includes two bulbs and hub) For all your smart lighting needs, look no further than the Philips’ Hue bulbs. These come in white or colored versions and you can use them in conjunction with Google Home to turn your lights on and off — as you would expect — or manage the settings of individual lights. You can give your bulbs names such as “living room” or “kitchen”, for example, and control them independently, including changing the colors of certain bulbs with the command “turn all the lights [color].” You can even set a brightness to a specific percentage, too. The Philips Hue A19 white starter kit we recommend comes with two white bulbs (which can’t change color) and a hub for $69.99 — possibly the best bang-for-buck you can get when starting out with these. The hub is required for these bulbs to operate, but, that said, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the Philips unit — others, like Samsung’s SmartThings hub, are available. For a lighting solution that works without a hub, check out the LIFX bulbs. Note that they’re quite a bit more expensive to buy individually than the Philips bulbs. Best Google Home smart plug Belkin WeMo Switch: $34.97 One of the easiest and most effective ways to control your home is with a smart plug like the WeMo Switch. This Wi-Fi-based plug doesn’t require an additional hub and is compatible with a dedicated WeMO app which you can use to operate it. The WeMo Switch can be set up to automatically turn household items on or off, and has options for scheduling, as well as an “Away Mode.” This will switch on your lights periodically when you’re not home to make it look like someone is still there (if you’re wondering why you’d do that, think Home Alone). Better yet, the WeMo Switch also integrates with the Nest thermostat to do things like switch off the lights when you leave your house. The Google Home can be used with the WeMo for voice control over your appliances, just ask Google to switch them on and off. It won’t work with typical wired lights (as they’re not plugged into the WeMo Switch) but anything with a standard power cable is game for voice control. Best Google Home hub Samsung SmartThings Hub: $79.99 A smart hub can be used to connect the various electronics devices in your home together and give you control over them. Samsung’s solution is compatible with a range of products, including those from Honeywell, Netgear, Halo and Phillips, with more being added all the time. Though the SmartThings hub comes with its own Android app, it can also be voice-controlled with the Google Home to control the lights and temperature. Of course, the SmartThings hub is only as good as the gadgets that you use with it, but Samsung seems to be investing pretty heavily in AI, having purchased AI platform developer Viv Labs last year. The possibilities, and compatible smart products, for Samsung’s SmartThings hub look like they’re only going to increase from here on out. Best Google Home TV and/or speaker system …Nope Here’s the thing: if you’re buying a new TV or speaker system, you should focus on the features you care about most from those and forget about Google Home integration. Why? Because almost any TV or audio system can be used in conjunction with the Google Home if you own one of the aforementioned Chromecasts. These provide a cost-effective way to Google Home-ify your products and mean that you don’t have to limit yourself to TVs with “Chromecast built-in” functionality. Just make sure your prospective TV has a spare HDMI port, or your speakers have a 3.5 mm audio input, if you do want to use a Chromecast or Chromecast Audio with them (the TV should also run at 4K resolution to take full advantage of the Chromecast Ultra). Of course, if the TV or speaker system you want does have a Chromecast built-in — as many now do — then it will work seamlessly with Google Home without an additional accessory.

(GuruFocus) Following Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s first-quarter results, Loup Ventures' Gene Munster said the results reiterate the company's artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality ambitions. AI-First Mantra Munster noted Google CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized on the earnings call his "AI-first" mantra. The analyst noted increased machine learning investment was highlighted in at least two segments of Google's ad model, namely smart bidding and universal app campaigns. Loup Ventures explained that smart bidding helps machines predict in real time how an ad should perform in front of a particular target and adjusts advertiser bids to maximize ROI. In universal app campaigns, machine learning is being used to best promote developer apps across Google properties including Search, YouTube and the Display Network, the firm added. Alt. Realities Munster noted management also made a couple of callouts on VR. "Google's VR platform Daydream is seeing more than half its usage consuming video, with YouTube VR being its #1 app by time spent," the analyst said. Giving an anecdote, Munster said, "At a recent event, we heard from Google that people are using the Daydream headset to 'hold the phone' for them as they watch video laying down." "While not an exciting VR use case, we heard that users are spending multiple hours in VR this way, so it is getting users comfortable with the experience." The analyst thinks VR investment near term still appears focused on mainstream products like Daydream and accompanied VR produced content such as YouTube VR, Google Earth VR and Tilt Brush. Although Google made no mention on the call, the analyst believes Google is also experimenting with advanced VR and AR hardware. Accordingly, Munster said he continues to believe Google is the best-positioned player to provide the AR operating system of the future, and the company's leadership position in machine learning and AI only reinforces that view. At the time of writing, Google shares were up 4.55 percent at $932.04.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: Kano This 7-year-old girl wrote a letter to Google and got a tech job out of it Mike Wehner @MikeWehner April 28th, 2017 at 1:39 PM Share Tweet How about this amazing little nugget to restore your faith in humanity: Chloe Bridgewater, a seven-year-old from Hereford, UK, is a big fan of technology and eventually wants to work for Google. Rather than wasting any time, she decided to send Google CEO Sundar Pichai a letter to let him know that she’s planning on working there one day. She got two things in return: A lovely letter from Pichai encouraging her to follow her dreams, and a paid job testing tech products for a tech startup based in London. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 “Dear Google boss,” Young Bridgewater’s letter begins. “May name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with Google.” She goes on to explain that she’s also planning on swimming in the Olympics and working at a chocolate factory, because what kid doesn’t dream of that? Her love of Google centers around its work culture, which includes kid-friendly bonuses like working from a bean bag or making your way from one floor of the company’s headquarters to another via slide. After her father posted a photo of her letter online it quickly went viral, catching the attention of Kano, the built-it-yourself computer startup that crushed its crowdfunding goals back in late 2013 and has been shipping its kits ever since. Now, the 7-year-old and her younger sister, Hollie, help Kano test new products ahead of time, giving the company feedback on what works and what doesn’t. The two girls were even added as board members of Kano’s product innovation board. See? The world isn’t all bad.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 462 Share on Facebook 108 Share on Twitter Total Shares632 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles Jason Edwards lol EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds. I was talking about our total hash of an NBN.

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Bala dunno whats stopping google from adding shutter speed and raw format to the google camera. hate them for it JD Saving it for the Pixel 2 *Obviously* Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice Random! Unfortunately it doesn't work for all phones. As you can read in the first asterisk, you can only set capture time on Nexus 5x and 6p. What I meant is: we need phone manufacturers to start adding such features to their camera apps. Would that really be so hard for them to do? martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. funky https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71165047&postcount=88 WittyPixel wow, being a 6P owner and semi xda nut surprised I missed that. thanks! WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply? Why would you want to do it again? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Blocking the Google fanboy. dabug91 because he totally REKT you? LOL Do the world a favor, and refrain from every using the internet again? Billy Bob Jimmy Joe It's funny when the troll blocks you. whispy_snippet Yep, can't win so you quit. Covering yourself in glory once again. Billy Bob Jimmy Joe You are an annoying troll. You probably just don't know it yet. You go to every Google article to bash the Pixel. I also see you bashing the Pixel in an article about a Samsung issue. You, sir, are pathetic. Mix I was like how in the heck can I do this with my Pixel!? ".....he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time" Dammit. New_Guy ....aaaa https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/24e29b3703f641799852ae78976add647c419d1f551c6dbd44d370d7d1efcc18.png nd it's now my wallpaper =) inthemidleofnowere What they need is to integrate exposure times, iso, and other of those 2 year old photography tools that have been present in Samsung and LG. Casper Pascal What?!?! How did he make the Nexus 6P do a 4-second long exposure shot? Nexus firmware just allows me to reach 1/5-second exposure time :( yubnub Umm no offense, but these look like crappy DSLR shots. Naxx ENVY I've taken some offence actually. Jason Edwards This is fantastic. I keep trying to tell all of the "photographers" that tell me physics gets in the way of a phone taking a good picture that they are discounting how much software will play in the future of photography. This proves I am right. dabug91 Umm, no, it doesn't prove you're right. Even 10 years from now, cameras with larger sensors will still be producing better images with richer detail than those with tiny sensors. Larger photosites DO make a difference that software simply can't account for. How do we know this? Because a 9-year-old 12-megapixel D700 full-frame DSLR and 28mm f/1.8 or f/2.8 lens still creates better images using software from nearly 9 years ago than what a modern-day flagship smartphone camera does with today's software. Cute ego about being "proven right", tho. Jason Edwards Umm, yes it does. Obviously you have no reading comprehension skills ? Where did I say this would ever measure up to large sensor cameras or be better than large sensors ? WHERE ???? I didn't but since you are so hell bent on trying to show up my cute ego I will explain to you in simple terms so your ignorant self can understand. I simple said this will help phones takes good pictures. That is all. I get told by "photographers" that smartphones will never take good photos. Now, go back and re-read my comment and then get over yourself. dabug91 I don't have to get over myself. I'm not the old man going around feeling the need to tell everyone "proves I was right" lmao. Your butthurt sure does have a lot of sting to it for being such an internet tough guy who can't handle the fact that he made a completely incorrect statement. But hey, keep telling yourself that software is more important in a camera's ability to take quality photographs. I see you failed to address the simple fact that a D700 will still take better pictures than a smartphone. Just proves that you even know you're wrong. Software wasn't a substitute for good light 10 years ago, isn't now, and still won't be 10 years from now. It's like you don't know where the "photo" in photography comes from. I'll give you a hint: it's not software. ;) Shai Nice long exposure shot of Tel Aviv's beaches I took with the LG G6: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed85a80053a2a1b8cbdb82d08e8410f7a33360c8fe6286d26df784785b86cfc7.jpg Biga173rd Exactly dabug91 Exactly really blurry. Biga173rd lol Biga173rd If I were in these locations my shots would look like those too. RainMotorsports It's kind of bad my Nexus 6P is better than my old dSLR in most situations that don't require off camera lighting or telephoto lenses. I need a new camera lol. George S I'd be happy if my Pixel XL took acceptable pictures in daylight never mind at night.

(Photo by Mat Hayward/Getty Images for We Day) Cloud Computing, Google, Microsoft Cloud Giants Disagree on the Future of Corporate Data Centers by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on April 28, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet We heard two very different perspectives on the future of on-premise enterprise data centers from top executives on this week’s earnings calls by two of the world’s largest cloud providers. Microsoft, which has a huge – and growing – on-premise data center software business in addition to a quickly growing cloud one, is continuing to pursue a hybrid strategy, pushing the idea that companies will want to continue using their internal data centers while augmenting them with cloud services. Alphabet subsidiary Google, which never had the need for an on-premise software business, is playing up wholesale shift of enterprise workloads from corporate data centers to its cloud. Here’s Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai on the company’s earnings call Thursday: “Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane (Greene, head of Google’s cloud business) and her team are having with customers. Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business.” Microsoft’s server product revenue grew 7 percent in the first calendar quarter (or third quarter of Microsoft’s fiscal 2017), indicating that its hybrid play is about more than protecting a legacy business. See also: Can Google Lure more Enterprises Inside Its Data Centers? The Cloud’s Edge The concept of on-premise infrastructure for Microsoft has evolved beyond just core enterprise data centers. It’s that, plus edge nodes for processing data generated by the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, retail stores and other sources of data. The company is building its next generation of on-premise data center software to bring artificial intelligence (in the form of neural networks) to customers’ edge nodes, so they can analyze and make decisions on the spot, while being part of a distributed infrastructure, which also includes the cloud and core enterprise data centers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Thursday’s earnings call: “Right when everyone’s talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. Whether it’s IoT, whether it’s the auto industry, whether it’s what’s happening in retail, essentially compute is going where the data gets generated, and increasingly data is getting generated at the volumes in which it’s drawing compute to it, which is the edge.” The strategy rests on two key on-prem products: Azure Stack and SQL Server. Azure Stack is the hardware and software appliance designed to act as a private extension of the public Azure cloud in corporate data centers and as edge nodes of this hybrid network. Following several instances of postponing its release, Microsoft’s latest expected general availability launch date is sometime around mid-2017. SQL Server 2017, expected this fall, is designed to run across customers’ own data centers, both core and edge, and their public cloud resources. It will support both Windows and Linux, as well as R, Python, and other programming languages widely used for machine learning and big data analytics. Here’s Nadella again: “The innovative work we’re doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed. And that’s what we are building towards.” Google and Microsoft remain far behind Amazon in terms of cloud revenue. However, virtually all major contenders for enterprise cloud market share, including Google, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and Alibaba, reported faster cloud revenue growth than Amazon’s. More on that here: Despite Growing Faster Than AWS, Top Cloud Contenders Still Far Behind What’s Amazon’s Take? Amazon Web Services acknowledged the importance of on-premise data center infrastructure in a big way last year by striking a partnership with Dell Technologies-controlled VMware, whose server virtualization software is ubiquitous in corporate data centers. VMware’s software will be sold as cloud services on top of AWS, at which point the companies promise seamless integration between those services and customers’ on-premise VMware environments.

It was a booming business — until it wasn’t. Here’s how things looked right before the most spectacular crash the technology industry had ever seen. The crumbling of Google’s cornerstone Search was Google’s only unambiguous win, as well as its primary source of revenue, so when Amazon rapidly surpassed Google as the top product search destination, Google’s foundations began to falter. As many noted at the time, the online advertising industry experienced a major shift from search to discovery in the mid-2010s. While Google protected its monopoly on the dying search advertising market, Facebook — Google’s biggest competitor in the online advertising space — got on the right side of the trend and dominated online advertising with its in-feed native display advertising. The people who turned to Amazon over Google? The 18–29 crowd led the way. In late 2015, Apple — Google’s main competitor in the mobile space — added a feature to their phones and tablets that allowed users to block ads. Devices running iOS were responsible for an estimated 75% of Google’s revenue from mobile search ads, so by making this move, Apple was simultaneously weighing in decisively on the great ad blocking debate of the 2010s and dealing a substantial blow to the future of online advertising. The rising number of users blocking ads on mobile showed no signs of slowing down A year later, as the internet went mobile, so too did ad blocking. The number of people blocking ads on a mobile device grew 102% from 2015 to 2016; by the end of 2016, an estimated 16% of smartphone users globally were blocking ads when browsing the internet on a mobile device. The number was as high as 25% for desktop and laptop users in the United States, a country that accounted for 47% of Google’s revenue. The people most likely to block ads were also the most valuable demographic: millennials and high earners. Young users are a good indicator for the future of technology, and they were heavy users of ad blocking software Internet users had spoken, and they hated ads. In early 2017, Google announced its plans to build an ad blocker into its popular Google Chrome browser. Google’s ad blocker would only block ads that were deemed unacceptable by the Coalition For Better Ads, effectively allowing the company to use its dominant web browser to strengthen its already dominant advertising business. Even after making this desperate and legally questionable move, it would quickly become clear to Google that even though ads were getting better, ad blocking numbers would continue to rise. Google had given even more people a small taste of what an ad-free internet experience could look like. The company discovered that it wasn’t just annoying ads that people didn’t like; it was ads in general. The advertising industry trying to figure out why people hated ads so much A key platform where Google served ads was YouTube, which it bought in 2006 and quickly turned into one of its biggest entities. But even with a sixth of the world visiting this video-sharing behemoth every month, YouTube never became profitable. In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, YouTube launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were underwhelming. YouTube’s already insurmountable problems multiplied in early 2017 as advertisers began to pull out amid ad placement controversies, and huge revenue generators began to leave the site. Even those who weren’t blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon “banner blindness”. The average banner ad was clicked on by a dismal 0.06% of viewers, and of those clicks, roughly 50% were accidental. Research showed that 54% of users reported a lack of trust as their reason for not clicking banner ads and 33% found them completely intolerable. These figures painted a pretty grim picture for the sustainability of online advertising, but especially for Google’s position within the industry. Google’s mighty engine had started to sputter. A chance to pivot, and how Google missed it If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn’t bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in technology’s history. They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google’s search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company’s strategy for artificial intelligence. “We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.” Google’s then-CEO Sundar Pichai famously predicted in 2016 that “the next big step will be for the very concept of the ‘device’ to fade away” and that “over time, the computer itself — whatever its form factor — will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.” Google’s ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging. Sundar Pichai wondering how to monetize a virtual assistant Google vs. Amazon Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a smash success. Google released its copycat product, Google Home, two years later, but it was already too late to catch up, and had no clear revenue strategy. Alexa — the assistant that lived inside the Echo — on the other hand, was quickly integrated into several products and services, and its monetization model was clear, viable, and most importantly future-friendly. The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money. Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn’t provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google’s expanding repertoire of expensive innovations. Google’s ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were far from receptive. Investors started to voice their concerns in 2017, but Sundar Pichai told them not to worry, leaving them to assume that Google would use their age-old strategy and analyze users’ voice searches so that users could be shown more suitable ads on devices with screens. Alexa celebrating its victory over Google Headlines in early 2017 proclaimed that “Alexa Just Conquered CES. The World is Next.” Amazon then made their technology available to third party manufacturers, putting even more distance between the two companies. Amazon had already beaten Google once before, holding 54% of the cloud computing market (compared to Google’s 3%) in 2016, and they were just getting started. By early 2017, Amazon had begun closing in on the entire retail industry. Ads weren’t forever At its peak, Google had a massive and loyal user-base across a staggering number of products, but advertising revenue was the glue that held everything together. As the numbers waned, Google’s core began to buckle under the weight of its vast empire. Google was a driving force in the technology industry ever since its disruptive entry in 1998. But in a world where people despised ads, Google’s business model was not innovation-friendly, and they missed several opportunities to pivot, ultimately rendering their numerous grand and ambitious projects unsustainable. Innovation costs money, and Google’s main stream of revenue had started to dry up. In a few short years, Google had gone from a fun, commonplace verb to a reminder of how quickly a giant can fall.

Google is expanding its use of 'not secure' warnings in Chrome. In a bid to push more websites to embrace encryption, Google is expanding its use of "not secure" warnings in Chrome. Google has favored sites with secure connections, or HTTPS, in its search results since 2014. In January, the company took things up a notch by showing "not secure" labels next to certain websites in Chrome that use an unencrypted HTTP server. Until now, Chrome has only displayed this label for sites that transmit passwords or process credit card transactions over HTTP instead of the more secure HTTPS. But beginning in October, Chrome will show the warning in two more situations: when users enter any type of data on an HTTP page; and on all HTTP pages people visit in Incognito mode. Since adding "not secure" notices in Chrome 56, Google has seen a 23 percent reduction in navigations to HTTP pages with password or credit card forms on desktop, Emily Schechter from the Chrome Security Team. Now wrote in a blog post. Related Privacy 101: Why You Need a VPN Privacy 101: Why You Need a VPN Starting with Chrome 62, the browser will show the "not secure" warning when users type any data into HTTP sites. "Passwords and credit cards are not the only types of data that should be private," Schechter wrote. "Any type of data that users type into websites should not be accessible to others on the network." Meanwhile, "when users browse Chrome with Incognito mode, they likely have increased expectations of privacy," Schechter wrote. "However, HTTP browsing is not private to others on the network," so users will get a warning about this. Eventually, Google plans to start showing the "not secure" warning for all HTTP pages in Chrome, Schechter added.

Personally, I love using smart home products, and I do so quite often in my home office. Here’s what I’ve been using. The best gifts for Android users Philips Hue When I bought a Google Home, I knew it was finally time to give in and jump into the Philips Hue ecosystem, mainly because it was one of Google’s only launch partners for home lighting. Several months later, I’m still ecstatic with the purchase. Every Hue device I’ve purchased has worked flawlessly, from the basic bulbs powering my lamps to the colored one I have in my ceiling light. Later on, I decided to take things a step further by purchasing a Hue Bloom, and is something I don’t regret either. The Hue Bloom and Hue Go (I love both) are definitely overpriced, but they work perfectly for what they’re designed for. I use the Bloom behind my TV to create a nice backlighting effect and the Hue Go is used constantly for rounding out lighting in my photos taken for the site. Most people won’t need these, but for me, they’re perfect, and they work so well with Google Home too. Philips Hue products at Amazon Philips Hue Go 9to5Mac Review TP-Link/Wemo Smart Wi-Fi Plugs Wi-Fi plugs are probably the most important part of my smart home setup. I use them to toggle the light strips and lamp on my desk, as well as a small fan and my two ceiling-mounted studio lights. The convenience of simply telling Google Home to turn these products off and on is something I’ve grown so accustomed to, I don’t think I could go back… When Google Home launched, I started using smart Wi-Fi plugs from Belkin. Wemo plugs are pretty bare bones and have a terrible companion app, but they do work pretty well. The standard version is also relatively cost-effective at about $25 on Amazon. My personal favorite plugs, though, come from TP-Link. The cost-to-reliability ratio is what makes these my pick. The standard TP-Link HS100 plug rarely drops its connection from my router, and response time with a command from Google Home is very quick for the most part. The newer TP-Link “mini” plug is less reliable, but its size also makes it an excellent choice. Starting at about $25, these plugs are excellent choices. TP-Link Smart Plugs at Amazon Wemo Smart Plugs at Amazon Chromecast Audio The last major product I use with Google Home is one of Google’s own, the Chromecast Audio. I love listening to music basically all the time, and Google Home is perfect for playing songs on Spotify and Pandora, my music services of choice. The speaker built into Home is good, but I highly prefer the Thonet & Vander Laut BT 2.1 speaker system I have hooked up to my TV. These have Bluetooth for streaming to my phone, but they also feature multiple inputs, which means I can easily hook up a Chromecast Audio and send music directly from my Google Home to that set of speakers. Why that over a standard Chromecast? Mainly because I don’t use one. I use an Nvidia Shield TV daily, and for some reason, Google can’t figure out how to get Home casting working properly with Android TV. So, this solution works a bit better for me. The Chromecast Audio at $35 is a great companion to Google Home, especially if you’ve got a good set of speakers to go with it.

Nintendo Switch Taking into account feedback from the inaugural conference at the Shoreline Amphitheatre last year, Google is increasing the size of each tent at I/O 2017. This should give more attendees the opportunity to listen to talks in person. Additionally, to minimize lines, there will be reserved seating, as well as first-come, first-served seating. Office Hours were in huge demand last year and Google is now doubling the number available, while sandbox demo areas are now inside climate-controlled structures. One format change has Google also hosting a Developer Keynote after the main keynote finishes at 11:30 AM. It is billed as a way for developers to “take advantage” of new product announcements. Google notes that more sessions will be added to the schedule in the coming weeks, with the final list not available until after the Developer Keynote finishes. There will be over 150 technical sessions this year and all of them will be livestreamed at google.com/io. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

By Selena Larson SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Cubans who use Google services will soon notice they load much faster. This week, Google's servers went live in Cuba, meaning the country will now store Google content locally. Google and the state-run telecom company Etecsa inked a deal in December to provide Cuban users access to the Google Global Cache (GGC). This network caches popular Google content -- like YouTube videos and Google searches -- for faster delivery to people's phones and computers. When someone in Cuba watches a YouTube video for the first time, that content has to travel through undersea cables from servers in another country. But once it gets to Cuba, it will now be stored on local servers, and the next person who wants to watch it will have a noticeably faster load time. Internet access in Cuba is limited and expensive, and some estimates say as little as 5% of people have internet at home. In order to surf the web, Cubans often congregate at cafes, hotels, and other public areas that have WiFi. According to a 2016 report from Freedom House, outdated infrastructure, government regulation, and the cost prevent widespread access. "Despite modest steps to increase internet access, Cuba remains one of the world's most repressive environments for information and communication technologies," the report said. However, it is slowly becoming more accessible. Emily Parker wrote the book "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are," about internet activism in Cuba and other countries. She says the internet could pose a threat to the Cuban government's control over information. "Google's entry signals the Cuban government's understanding that the Internet is necessary for economic development," Parker said. Last year, Google partnered with a local artist known as Kcho to open a technology center that provides free, faster internet to the public. Google's servers won't bring internet to more people, but those who already have the internet will see faster load times for Google services. Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at internet performance company Dyn, noticed the GGC nodes activate on Wednesday for Google Search. He said some people are reporting that they aren't yet being directed to the Cuban GGC for YouTube, but it should happen soon "It is a milestone, as this is the first time an outside internet company has hosted anything in Cuba," Madory said.

Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard - At The Northwestern Kellogg Public-Private Interface Conference On "New Developments In Consumer Finance: Research & Practice" Date 28/04/2017 Watch Live We can learn a lot from the evolution of smartphones as we try to envisage where the fintech ecosystem--and banks' role within it--might be heading in the future. Smartphones have ushered in an age when different companies can easily work with each other's products to seamlessly provide services to consumers. Today I want to reflect on what we might learn from that model about the increasingly interconnected world of financial services. On the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, a Wired.com article revealed that even Steve Jobs hadn't predicted the smartphone's potential as a platform.1 Apple was just trying to design an iPod that made phone calls. Today, the average American spends five hours a day on their phone, unlocking it an average of 80 times daily.2 Even the Supreme Court has noted that smartphones are now "such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy."3 Of course, we aren't using these appendages primarily to make phone calls. Instead, we mainly use our smartphones to access applications (apps).4 In June of last year, Apple announced that over 2 million apps were available on its App Store.5 For the most part, these apps were not created or even envisaged by Apple. These apps have been downloaded 130 billion times, generating over $50 billion in revenue for third-party developers.6 The iPhone is a key platform on which that app ecosystem operates. How did that happen? Apple essentially made the smartphone a toolkit for third-party developers to experiment, innovate, build, and scale new apps. It did so by investing heavily in developing open application programming interfaces (APIs) that provided third-party developers clear instructions and open access to the iPhone platform. This strategy enabled those outside developers to build new applications that delivered Apple's customers additional value by taking advantage of the existing functionality of the iPhone. Specifically, this open architecture makes available to outside developers clear instructions that enable them to use the iPhone's various sensors, processors, displays, and other interfaces in combination with their own code to develop new products. On top of that, a robust secondary layer of developers use the APIs of other developers in their technology stacks to quickly assemble new business models. Take ride-sharing services, for instance. They have built multibillion-dollar businesses that are, in large part, dependent on combinations of APIs from different companies. They may use Google Maps' APIs for location services, Stripe or Braintree's APIs for payments, Twilio's APIs for text messaging, and Amazon Web Services' or IBM's APIs for computing power. All of these products, and more, work seamlessly together in real time to provide products that are so ubiquitous that we now use them as verbs for how we navigate the world. We "Uber" to the store or "Snapchat" a friend. Risks and Opportunities in an Increasingly Interconnected World There is every reason to expect financial services to make a similar transition to an increasingly interconnected digital world. By now, we've all heard estimates of the thousands of fintech companies that have launched in the past few years and the billions of investment dollars that are flooding into this sector.7 But for all of the talk of "disruption," I want to underscore an important point: More often than not, there is a banking organization somewhere in the fintech stack. Just as third-party app developers rely on smartphone sensors, processors, and interfaces, fintech developers need banks somewhere in the stack for such things as: (a) access to consumer deposits or related account data, (b) access to payment systems, (c) credit origination, or (d) compliance management.8 For instance, account comparison services rely on access to data from consumers' bank accounts. Savings and investment apps analyze transactions data from bank accounts to understand how to optimize performance and manage the funds consumers hold in those accounts. Digital wallets draw funds from payment cards or bank accounts. Marketplace loans most often depend on loan origination by a bank partner. And payment innovations often "settle up" over legacy payment rails, like the automated clearinghouse system.9 In short, the software stacks of almost all fintech apps point to a bank at one layer or another. So as fintech companies and banks are catching up to the interconnected world, the various players are sorting out how best to do the connecting. Much of the work so far has been focused on the technical challenges, which are notable. Most banks' core systems are amalgams of computing mainframes built decades ago before the Internet or cloud computing were widely available and, in many cases, stitched together over the course of mergers and consolidations.10 It takes a lot of investment to securely convert that infrastructure to platforms that can operate in real-time with ready access for Internet-native third-party developers. But important policy, regulatory, and legal questions also demand attention. And that is where the smartphone analogy loses its power. On balance, bank activities are much more highly regulated than smartphones. Those regulations enable consumers to trust their banks to secure their funds and maintain the integrity of their transactions. While "run fast and break things" may be a popular mantra in the technology field, it is ill suited to an arena where a serious breach could undermine confidence in the payments system. Indeed, some of the key underpinnings of consumer protection and safety and soundness in the banking world--that consumers should be exceptionally careful in granting account access, that in certain conditions banks could be presumed to bear liability for unauthorized charges, and that banks can be held responsible for ensuring that service providers and vendors do right by their customers--sit uneasily alongside the requisites of openness, connectivity, and data access that enable today's app ecosystem.11 For instance, before entering an outsourcing arrangement, a bank is expected to consider whether the service provider's internal processes or systems (or even human error at the outside party) could expose the bank and its customers to potential losses or expose the bank's customers to fraud and the bank to litigation; whether the service provider complies with applicable laws and regulation; and whether poor performance by that outside party could materially harm the bank's public reputation. The smartphone app ecosystem developed without the regulations or associated guardrails pertaining to institutions that people trust to hold their life savings. For instance, when Pokémon Go was first launched, its creator, Niantic, used an outdated Google API to verify consumer identities. This created confusion about whether millions of consumers had unwittingly granted Niantic full access to their e-mails, contact lists, and calendars.12 However, it did not stand in the way of Pokémon Go subsequently being downloaded a half billion times.13 In contrast, these kinds of mistakes in the banking sector could raise grave concerns about consumer data privacy and security and the integrity of consumer transactions data. That's why banks are expected to conduct extensive risk assessments and due diligence of their service providers, extending even to operations and internal controls, among other requirements.14 While that helps ensure a safe and sound banking system, that also makes it more challenging for both the banks and fintech companies to harness safely the interconnectivity that has powered other parts of the digital world. Different Approaches to the Fintech Stack Because of the high stakes, fintech firms, banks, data aggregators, consumer groups, and regulators are all still figuring out how best to do the connecting. There are a few alternative approaches in operation today, with various advantages and drawbacks. A number of large banks have developed or are in the process of developing interfaces to allow outside developers access to their platforms under controlled conditions. Similar to Apple opening the APIs of its phones and operating systems, these financial companies are working to provide APIs to outside developers, who can then build new products on the banks' platforms.15 It is worth highlighting that platform APIs generally vary in their degree of openness, even in the smartphone world. If a developer wants to use a Google Maps API to embed a map in her application, she first must create a developer account with Google, agreeing to Google's terms and conditions. This means she will have entered a contract with the owner of the API, and the terms and conditions may differ depending on how sensitive the particular API is. Google may require only a minimum amount of information for a developer that wants to use an API to display a map. Google may, however, require more information about a developer that wants to use a different API to monitor the history of a consumer's physical locations over the previous week. And in some cases, the competitive interests of Google and a third-party app developer may diverge over time, such that the original terms of access are no longer acceptable.16 The fact that it is possible and indeed relatively common for the API provider--the platform--to require specific controls and protections over the use of that API raises complicated issues when imported to the banking world. As banks have considered how to facilitate connectivity, the considerations include not only technical issues and the associated investment, but also the important legal questions associated with operating in a highly regulated sector. The banks' terms of access may be determined in third-party service provider agreements that may offer different degrees of access. These may affect not only what types of protections and vetting are appropriate for different types of access over consumers' funds and data held at a bank in order to enable the bank to fulfill its obligations for data security and other consumer protections, but also the competitive position of the bank relative to third-party developers. There is a second broad type of approach in which many banks have entered into agreements with specialized companies that essentially act as middlemen, frequently described as "data aggregators." These banks may lack the budgets and expertise to create their own open APIs or may not see that as a key element in their business strategies. Data aggregators collect consumer financial account data from banks, on the one hand, and then provide access to that data to fintech developers, on the other hand.17 Data aggregators organize the data they collect from banks and other data sources and then offer their own suite of open APIs to outside developers. By partnering with data aggregators, banks can open their systems to thousands of developers, without having to invest in creating and maintaining their own open APIs. This also allows fintech developers to build their products around the APIs of two or three data aggregators, rather than 15,000 different banks and other data sources. And, if agreements between data aggregators and banks are structured as data aggregators performing outsourced services to banks, the bank should be able to conduct the appropriate due diligence of its vendors, whose services to those banks may be subject to examination by safety and soundness regulators.18 Some banks have opted for a more "closed" approach to fintech developers by entering into individual agreements with specific technology providers or data aggregators.19 These agreements often impose specific requirements rather than simply facilitating structured data feeds. These banks negotiate for greater control over their systems by limiting who is accessing their data--often to a specific third party's suite of products. Likewise, many banks use these agreements to limit what types of data will be shared. For instance, banks may share information about the balances in consumers' accounts but decline to share information about fees or other pricing. While recognizing the legitimate need for vetting of third parties for purposes of the banks fulfilling their responsibilities, including for data privacy and security, some consumer groups have suggested that the standards for vetting should be commonly agreed to and transparent to ensure that banks do not restrict access for competitive reasons and that consumers should be able to decide what data to make available to third-party fintech applications.20 A third set of banks may be unable or unwilling to provide permissioned access, for reasons ranging from fears about increased competition to concerns about the cost and complexity of ensuring compliance with underlying laws and regulations. At the very least, banks may have reasonable concerns about being able to see, if not control, which third-party developers will have access to the banking data that is provided by the data aggregators. Accordingly, even banks that have previously provided structured data feeds to data aggregators may decide to limit or block access.21 In such cases, however, data aggregators can still move forward to collect consumer data for use by fintech developers without the permission or even potentially without the knowledge of the bank. Instead, data aggregators and fintech developers directly ask consumers to give them their online banking logins and passwords. Then, in a process commonly called "screen scraping," data aggregators log onto banks' online consumer websites, as if they were the actual consumers, and extract information. Some banks report that as much as 20 to 40 percent of online banking logins is attributable to data aggregators. They even assert that they have trouble distinguishing whether a computer system that is logging in multiple times a day is a consumer, a data aggregator, or a cyber attack. For community banks with limited resources, the necessary investments in API technology and in negotiating and overseeing data-sharing agreements with data aggregators and third-party providers may be beyond their reach, especially as they usually rely on service providers for their core technology. Some fintech firms argue that screen scraping--which has drawn the most complaints about data security--may be the most effective tool for the customers of small community banks to access the financial apps they prefer--and thereby necessary to remain competitive until more effective broader industry solutions are developed. Clearly, getting these connectivity questions right, including the need to manage the consumer protection risks, is critically important. It could make the difference between a world in which the fintech wave helps community banks become the platforms of the future, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, a world in which fintech instead further widens the gulf between community banks and the largest banks. Tradeoffs The different approaches to integrating banks into the fintech stack represent different risks and tradeoffs. Connectivity solutions that require intermediaries such as data aggregators and rely on screen scraping potentially create repositories of consumer credentials for hackers to target. Banks argue that if such a repository is breached, thousands of banks could be impacted.22 Further complicating things, because screen scrapers operate without contractual relationships with the banks from which they pull information, banks have little leverage or ability to vet the security of the screen scrapers' systems and methods or their overall risk. In these circumstances, some commentators have noted that if a data aggregator or third-party developer is breached, it may not be clear who would bear responsibility for any losses--the bank, the data aggregator, the fintech developer, or the consumer. Some third-party developers have included terms and conditions that specifically limit their liability to consumers.23 It is not clear the extent to which many consumers understand the risks involved with sharing their banking credentials, the more limited liability accepted by many third-party developers relative to their bank or credit card issuer, and the fact that the third-party developers may in turn provide those credentials to others in some instances. On the other side of the debate, fintech companies are concerned that banks could use their control over consumer data access in the context of bilateral contracts with data aggregators to leverage their position in order to impede competition elsewhere in the stack. This argument about access and competition echoes similar concerns in the smartphone arena.24 Further, third-party developers argue that open standards for data access can help banks meet consumers' expectations for mobile banking by providing access to the fintech apps that best serve their needs. The relatively open architecture of the iPhone platform means that Apple profits from outside developers' products without having to design or invest in them directly. For instance, Apple didn't include a home-grown mapping app during the first few years of the iPhone.25 Instead, it relied on Google to provide that important function for its smartphones before trying to build its own mapping tool--a process that took a number of iterations before getting it right. Open platform strategies may mean that banks can essentially outsource product development to fintech firms.26 This could be a boon--particularly for small community banks that would not have to worry about developing the best consumer interface, mobile app, digital wallet, or lending product. The bank would only have to worry about getting the connections to an open API right and then reap the benefits of the innovation by third parties. Regulatory Developments As regulators, we have a responsibility to ensure that the institutions subject to our supervision are operated safely and soundly and that they comply with applicable statutes and regulations. More broadly, we have a strong interest in permitting socially beneficial innovations to flourish, while ensuring the risks that they may present are appropriately managed, consistent with the legal requirements. We do not want to unnecessarily restrict innovations that can benefit consumers and small businesses through expanded access to financial services or greater efficiency, convenience, and reduced transaction costs. Nor do we want to drive these activities away from regulated banks and toward less governed spaces in the financial system. Regulators in the United Kingdom and continental Europe have recently outlined new approaches to facilitate connectivity in financial services, while attempting to mitigate the associated risks. In August 2016, the UK Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) released a package of mandates aimed at increasing competition for consumer and small business current accounts (akin to U.S. checking accounts).27 This year nine of the country's largest banks were required to create open APIs to share nonsensitive, non-consumer-specific information, like pricing, fees, terms, and conditions as well as branch and automated teller machine locations.28 This initial limited sharing of information has started communication and collaboration across the industry on areas like data standards and organizational governance, which will facilitate work on more contentious questions. Before March 2018, the CMA is scheduled to enforce a broader package of reforms, including mandating that the nine banks create APIs that allow third-party banks and nonbanks to access consumer accounts for reading transaction data and payment initiation. In the European Union, beginning in 2018, member states will be required to start implementing the European Parliament's revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).29 Among other elements, PSD2 created licensing regimes for third parties that access bank accounts for purposes of initiating payment orders or consolidating information with consumers' consent.30 The directive mandates that banks allow these licensed third parties to access their consumer accounts (with consumer permission) without premising such access on contractual agreements with the banks. Indeed, PSD2 requires that credit institutions not block or hinder access to payment accounts and that licensed third parties have access to credit institutions' payment accounts services in an objective, nondiscriminatory, and proportionate manner. When credit institutions do reject access, they are required to provide the relevant authorities detailed reasoning for the rejection. The directive attempts to mitigate the attendant data-security and consumer-protection risks with a number of measures that, by and large, are not readily available policy options in the United States. Importantly, third parties that access bank accounts will be subject to licensing and registration requirements, as well as associated capital and insurance requirements. Moreover, the directive envisions that electronic payments will be authorized by two-factor authentication--for example "something you know" and "something you are."31 The United States is likely to address these issues in a different way, at least initially, given that regulatory authorities are more broadly distributed, and the relevant statutory language predates these technological developments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a Request for Information last fall to explore issues surrounding consumers' granting access to account information to third parties.32 Of course, safety and soundness regulation--and with it, concerns about data security, cyber security, and vendor risk management--is distributed among a number of regulators. For instance, there may be value to examining the vendor risk management guidance so that it facilitates banks connecting more securely and efficiently with the fintech apps that consumers prefer.33 Similarly, it could be useful to periodically assess whether and how authority under the Bank Service Company Act might pertain to developments in the fast evolving fintech sector. In addition, the private sector is continuing to actively experiment with a variety of different approaches to the connectivity question and may itself move toward one or more widely accepted standards. Accordingly, efforts to craft approaches that enhance connectivity while mitigating the associated risks will likely benefit from the engagement of multiple agencies, along with input from the private sector and other stakeholders. Separately, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is responsible for administering national bank charters, has announced that it is exploring offering "special purpose national bank charters" to fintech companies.34 As envisioned by the OCC, obtaining a special purpose charter would have the practical effect of allowing certain fintech companies (companies that make loans, make payments, or accept deposits) to potentially bypass the need for connecting to a bank for certain purposes in favor of becoming licensed as banks themselves. The OCC's proposal raises interpretive and policy issues for the Federal Reserve regarding whether charter recipients would become Federal Reserve members or have access to Federal Reserve accounts and services, such as direct access to payment systems. If the OCC proposal is finalized, the Federal Reserve would have to closely analyze these issues with respect to any fintech firms that express an interest in moving forward with an application. When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, who could have predicted that it would net billions from a game like Pokémon Go, which involved no investment, development, or advertising on Apple's part beyond opening its platform to developers? It is still too early to have any confidence that we know which fintech innovations will prove to be the most long-lasting or widely adopted. By the same token, the fintech industry is still figuring out the fundamental questions of the best ways to make the necessary connections to the banking platforms to facilitate consumers' ability to better monitor and manage their financial lives, while providing the level of data security and protection they have come to rely on from their banks.35 Change is surely coming, as financial products and services move onto interconnected platforms. As the sector evolves, it's important that all parties involved pay close attention not only to the technical questions, but to the requisite regulatory, policy, and legal considerations to ensure continued trust and confidence in the financial system.   1.

When the iPhone first launched, for instance, one phone provider paid a premium for exclusive access to the smartphone. This meant that, for several years, consumers that wanted the iPhone also had to enter relationships with the only Internet service provider platform that offered the phone. See, e.g., Saul Hansell, "Why AT&T Wants to Keep the iPhone Away from Verizon," New York Times, April 22, 2009, https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/why-att-wants-to-keep-the-iphone-away-from-verizon/ ("AT&T is paying Apple an unusually high subsidy on top of the $199 and $299 paid by iPhone buyers. But it appears to be getting quite a return on that investment.") At the same time, Apple has used its own iPhone platform to affect the development of products further up the stack. While much of the iPhone is an open platform for third-party developers, developers do not have access to the iPhone's secure element and Near Field Communication (NFC) antenna--key components of digital wallet technologies. This means that Apple Pay is the only "tap-to-pay" NFC digital wallet available for iPhones--and that Apple Pay competitors, like Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are unable to access 40 percent of the smartphones in the United States. See, e.g., Philip Elmer-DeWitt, "About Apple's 40% Share of the U.S. Smartphone Market," Fortune, February 11, 2016, http://fortune.com/2016/02/11/apple-iphone-ios-share/.

Chris Davies - Apr 28, 2017 9 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit A Pixel 2 XXL with a Snapdragon 835 chipset and pure Android could take on the Samsung Galaxy S8+ later this year, if tidbits turned up in the code are to be believed. The smartphone is believed to be the third in a three-strong range of Pixel 2 handsets for 2017, and internally codenamed “taimen” in keeping with Google’s fondness for fish. While it won’t be the first device to reach the market with Qualcomm’s latest chipset, there may well be a few reasons why Android fans opt to catch the Pixel 2 XXL and throw back the rest. That Google is working on new Pixel devices for 2017 is no surprise. The phones – which distinguish themselves with untampered Android, as well as the earliest OS updates and usually the cutting-edge in new apps and features, such as the Google Assistant – have proved a popular option, with Google struggling to keep them in stock even now, months after their launch. As such, Android enthusiasts are eager to hear what might be coming down the pipeline, and how it might compare to devices like the Galaxy S8, LG G6, and iPhone 8. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were already a given. According to some code-digging by German site WinFuture, though, the “taiman” internal codename has cropped up in Google’s AOSP, complete with a connection to the processor it’s expected to use. It’s not the first time we’ve heard talk of a potential third addition to the Pixel 2 range. Rumors have been circulating for the past couple of months, in fact, after the “taimen” codename surfaced. Like the existing codenames for Pixel 2 – “walleye” and “muskie” – it has a piscine spin, in keeping with Google’s practice of fish-related internal naming. That’s not just been an odd but charming habit, mind. Google has also used the sizes of the fish it names devices after to indicate the relative size of the phones themselves. Last year, for instance, Pixel’s codename was “sailfish”, a smaller species than the “marlin” codename that the Pixel XL bore. This year, we have three fish and three different sizes, “taimen” being the largest of the trio. Exactly what screen size that might translate to is unclear: the current Pixel is 5.1-inches, while the Pixel XL is 5.5-inches. Meanwhile, by trimming down its display bezels and switching to a new, narrower aspect ratio, Samsung has managed to squeeze a 6.2-inch Super AMOLED panel into its Galaxy S8+. That’s despite being only a fraction of an inch longer than the Pixel XL. The stage seems ripe for an even larger Pixel 2 with a bumper display, therefore, and if the dots that are slowly being connected pan out, it could be quite the phone. The Snapdragon 835 is certainly up to the task of a modern flagship, and Google’s strategy of pairing excellent camera sensors with its homegrown algorithms and processing has paid dividends: even today, the Pixel holds its own against the latest phones from Samsung, LG, Apple, and others when it comes to photography. Provide phablet fans with a pocket-friendly, big-screen option as well, and it could help offset Google’s controversial decision not to replace the discontinued Nexus 9 tablet any time soon. Of course, by the time the Pixel 2 – in regular, XL, and XXL sizes – arrives, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will have been on the market for some time. As we found in our own review, they’re the cream of the current Android crop; Samsung too has been surprised by the demand, no less. Could a Pixel with the same processor sway you over into Google’s camp? Let us know in the comments.

These constant shifts have challenged the hospitality industry to keep pace with new technology and trends so as to compete in the online community space. NB: This is an analysis by Jean-Luis Boss, chief marketing and digital services officer at Fastbooking. Optimising a hotel’s online distribution to drive more direct traffic requires digital marketing strategy and tools to be efficient and effective in their efforts within the online community. In 2015, just two years ago, organic traffic accounted for 62% of the traffic in a hotel website. This figure has reduced to 42% in 2017. Undoubtedly, this is still an important source of traffic for hoteliers to leverage on. The apparent reason being is that organic traffic to a hotel’s website is nearly free. However, this is not sufficient to drive more traffic and conversion to a hotel’s website. To compete effectively in the digital community space, an effective digital marketing strategy to drive more qualified traffic and conversion to the hotel’s website is pertinent. This plan, as we all know, encompasses search engine marketing (SEM), pre-and retargeting display ads campaigns, AdWords and the ultimate driver, metasearch. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, Metasearch has grown to become the most important advertising channel for hotels outpacing even AdWords, according to own data. And this trend is escalating. The evolution of metasearch in 2017 We have been managing metasearch campaigns for hotels for more than seven years. From the launch of metasearch, our hotel booking platforms were connected to the leading hotel metasearch channels to advertise direct hotel rates. During this period, we have seen ample growth for this digital channel, and we have learnt the strategy of optimising the various metasearch channels to generate maximum revenue for hotels with the best possible return on ad spend. We found it important to help hotels understand the various digital channels and how they work so that they can make better choices and decisions on advertising budgets. 1. TripAdvisor Over the last five years, TripAdvisor has held the dominant position in metasearch advertising, especially in areas of quality of traffic and revenue generated. The illustration below provides the year-on-year progress on revenue generation and traffic cost versus the return on ad spend. Although TripAdvisor remains as one of the key channels on the market and is still one of the best performing platforms for metasearch, its numbers have recently declined both in traffic volume and return on investment. Brief history: In 2012: The volume of clicks was much higher because TripAdvisor still had its infamous pop-under system (opens a separate page on the website). Anyone searching for information on a hotel would receive six or more offers at the same time. In 2013: TripAdvisor system changed to display dynamic rates, causing traffic to decrease while the cost per click increased. In 2014: The cost per click peaked to 400% from 2012, and the return on the ad spend declined. However, the conversion rate was much higher with much more qualified traffic. In 2015: The prices evened out and a steady reduction in the cost per click. Return on ad spend reverted to the 2012 level which was consistent around 10X the previous levels. Our analysis TripAdvisor produces highly qualified traffic with good conversion rates and has a very international audience even though it is strongest in North America. For hotels in Europe and Asia, this translates into a high return on investment as the average stay is longer than domestic or regional audiences. From our analysis, users who book through TripAdvisor has an average stay of 4.5 days. The bidding system has improved over the years but remains quite opaque. The priority is given to the highest bidder, and as an advertiser, you will not know how much that bid is. One can opt for a “share of clicks,” which somewhat guarantees that one will be visible and receive clicks a certain percentage of the time. Changes in bidding and campaigns can be managed on a daily basis. Our tip Do not systematically bid for the first position as the cost can rapidly raise and returns will lower. Instead, use TripAdvisor’s reporting to stay within the top 3. Additionally, if one’s ADR is low, opt for the “Instant Booking” model to keep costs low. 2. Google Hotel Ads Google launched Hotel Ads as Hotel Finder in 2011. Since then the product has changed names to Google Hotel Price Ads and now to Google Hotel Ads. The product and performance have grown exponentially every year both in terms of click volume and return on ad spend. Following a slightly different business model than other metasearch products, Google launched with a pay-per-click model that was based on the total cost of the potential reservation. They retained this model but added a performance model which is a percentage of the actual booking fee. Based on click volume, Google’s Hotel Ads matured in 2016, and today the click volume equal or surpasses TripAdvisor while keeping a very profitable Return on ad spend. As Google is integrating the ads deeper into its search results, maps, and other products, it is poised to become one of the leading hotel metasearch providers in the market. Our analysis Google Hotel Ads currently has the most qualified traffic of all metasearch providers. Traffic volume is now at a level that makes it a compelling investment for hotels and hotel groups of all sizes. However, it is quite complicated to manage the bidding system that offers extremely granular possibilities. This is too complex to manage unless one has a full-time e-commerce or advertising manager. Google Hotel Ads has stopped developing direct connectivity with hotels and is always connected through a third party. With Google’s experience and expertise in AdWords, they have developed a management system to optimise bidding and precise geo-targeting. The bids are managed every few minutes if not instantly, making it a reliable metasearch platform for budget control and adjustments. The system is very open and offers full transparency on performance, competitiveness and opportunities. Our tip To be effective when advertising on Google Hotel Ads, we recommend for budget hotels to switch to the performance model and for Deluxe and luxury hotels with a higher ADR to use the cost per click model. Hotels must ensure that these multiple campaigns are constantly monitored and managed. 3. Trivago Trivago has always been one of the main click volume producers on the metasearch market. The cost per click is the lowest of all the metasearch providers, yet the ROI has not been as good as TripAdvisor or Google Hotel Ads, although it is increasing. The steady growth of the platform since the part equity acquisition by Expedia in 2013 and the subsequent large investment in brand visibility through TV ads make this platform a very attractive option for hotels that require a boost in brand awareness. Our analysis From a budget management perspective, this is a platform that requires careful observation and management. We have seen massive traffic increases each time TV ad campaigns are launched. However, the conversion rate is relatively low. To ensure that budgets are not depleted, we recommend hotels to make sure that their budgets and bids are properly managed for maximum returns. Small changes in bids (such as a single cent increase) can have a significant impact on impression share and can result in budget over-spend. There is no built-in budget capping, though some third parties have created their own. The platform is improving quite frequently, including in its management possibilities. Trivago can be used successfully for international traffic, but it is most efficient with inbound travellers from Europe. Finally, the business model is the cost per click only. As many of the hotels used for this analysis were located in Europe, the average length of stay was shorter than TripAdvisor (2 nights versus 4.5). The ranking system is prioritised by the best rate first and the bid second, if there is full rate parity the bid obviously takes priority. Our tip As Trivago’s ranking model prioritises rates if one can have a slightly lower rate on their website one will get more clicks at a lower cost. 4. HotelsCombined HotelsCombined is one of the most important metasearch partners for our hotels in this area. One of the first companies in the hotel metasearch market, HotelsCombined delivers an excellent return on investment for hotels targeting travellers going to Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand demographics. Our analysis Although the click volumes are lower than TripAdvisor, Trivago, and Google Hotel Ads, the demographics served by HotelsCombined are a valuable addition to hotels seeking travellers from Asia Pacific region. Click volumes are stable, and the business model only costs per acquisition with very little control over visibility. However, it is a must if one wants to add traffic from those regions. 5. Google AdWords We have included Google AdWords, even though it is NOT a metasearch channel, as a comparison between advertising costs and returned on investment for hotel marketers. AdWords are still one of the most cost-efficient advertising channels for hotels both in terms of return on ad spend and click volumes. AdWords have consistently had the highest return on investment, and even though metasearch has recently overtaken AdWords as an advertising channel, in terms of revenue generated, it remains a vital channel for hotel marketers. The efficiency of AdWords is extremely high when using it to protect one’s hotel brand name from OTAs or other third parties trying to advertise on one’s name. Our tip Be careful when targeting broad or generic keywords such as “Hotels in [city]” as these keywords are very expensive and have a low return on ad spend for individual hotels. Focus instead on a mix of 80% brand keywords and 20% broader keywords with extreme care on budget spend. 6. Display advertising We also included display advertising as we have noticed through our campaign management that this nicely complements metasearch advertising, both in brand awareness and conversions. Through running multiple campaigns using targeted display channels and retargeting, we have seen an average return on ad spend of 10.2X. This makes it a very profitable addition to the advertising mix. Our tip Individual results depend on the hotel’s location: High-interest destinations such as the main cities tend to have a better return since there is more traffic from the pre-targeting campaigns. The trick here is to ensure that there is enough display volume to generate brand awareness without over-saturating the ads to the travellers, and knowing when to turn the campaigns off so as not to display irrelevant advertising to the guest. Key takeaways and recommendations Metasearch can help you drive more traffic to your website: Metasearch is to become the most important advertising channel for hotels. Select the different digital players that are most pertinent to your business according to your sales area and your objectives: mass volume or high return on investment. The efficiency of your direct booking strategy depends on your price: We have noticed a substantial difference in return on ad spend for hotels that chose to give advantages to direct bookings. Lowering rates for direct bookings is one of the most efficient ways to make metasearch generate substantial direct revenue. We have noticed a return on ad spend by an average of 2.5X. As a general rule of thumb, if one is selling at higher rates on one’s website the results will not be profitable. At rate parity, the results are acceptable, although this lowers the direct booking percentage. Look for professionals: To secure a hotel’s direct bookings or simply to increase revenue across multiple sources, metasearch and digital advertising channels have become mandatory channels for both independent and chains hotels. We recommend hotel groups and chains to create an internal team for campaign management and optimisation. For independent hotels, it would be wise to use an experienced digital agency. Keep monitoring: Metasearch, like all online advertising platforms, is not set-it-and-forget-it platforms. It requires optimisation to ensure that the return-on-ad-spend is kept profitable. (One final) Food for thought The constant change in technology has kept hoteliers on their toes with constant adaptation. Different shifts in digital strategies to maximise direct traffic includes metasearch in the hotel distribution mix. We have witnessed that if digital marketing strategies are handled with experience, paid traffic can represent 30-50% of market share per hotel. This is definitely worth the effort and attention. Metasearch, notably Google Hotel Ads, are strong allies to Independent hotels. This would provide high visibility and conversion as compared to OTAs. Now the question that remains is “How to be connected to Metasearch?“ Hotel distribution is not going to get simpler; it will require a constant shift of strategies. Mobile, new technologies such as chatbots, etc. will continue to transform the digital landscape. But this also mean new opportunities and improved performance possibilities for hoteliers that embrace these new trends and technology.

Reply 10 hrs ago   William Beckler ROAS is the wrong number to look at for these channels, as so many of them are non-accretive. The real number to think about for a hotelier is *incremental* ROAS. If a click comes from Tripadvisor, that is not necessarily incremental, since that customer probably would have booked even if they had not clicked on a hotel website link on Tripadvisor moment. Same goes for the other channels, but in every case the incrementality factor changes depending on the kind of searches happening on those channels. Tripadvisor gets hotel-specific searches. Same with Google HPA. Trivago and Kayak are dependent on what other bids are coming in, because they adjust overall rank based on bids. In most cases, when OTAs are competing for clicks, the incrementality factor is affected by the commission rates of the OTAs, because a nondirect click doesn’t mean a nonbooking, it just means a booking via an OTA. Reply 1 week ago   tralari nondirect click doesn’t mean a nonbooking, it just means a booking via an OTA. Hence more expensive. Metasearch is no so much about incremental bookings but about getting those bookings at a cheaper commission and taking some business out of OTAs so they become less important in your overall distribution. Reply 5 days ago   Martin Agreed it is not necessarily incremental. To generate incremental bookings requires a much larger strategy working on the inspiration end of the marketing funnel. Metasearch and (arguably) adwords are more focused towards the end of the funnel. Hence why working with OTAs is beneficial. But when talking about direct bookings it is more about optimizing channels than adding new incremental revenue. Reply 4 days ago   Jean-Louis Boss Hi William, thanks for the comment. It isn’t easy to measure the incremental revenue generated since there are reservations that happen on one channel rather than another. In many instances direct revenue is only partially incremental. To measure incremental I would advise looking at a hotel’s overall revenue compared to the same time last year. Individual channels are often a transfer from one to the other. The most important for hotels at the end is to balance their bookings coming from OTAs to be less dependent as direct bookings are globally cheaper and then reduce their global distribution costs.

This page details the timeline for Android versions and security patches for products. The update to the Pixel page indicates that the search giant does not guarantee Android updates for the Pixel and XL after October 2018. OpenClipart-Vectors / Pixabay Android P could be last Android update for Pixel and XL According to Google’s end-of-life support page, the Pixel phones will get updates for at least two years from the time they first became available on the Google Store. This does not come as a surprise, as Google’s update schedule has been more or less the same with Nexus devices too – Android updates for two years and security updates for three years or 18 months after the stock runs out on the online store, notes GSMArena. Since the Pixel was released in October, the handsets will get “guaranteed” Android updates until October 2018. The word “guaranteed” here does suggest that after October 2018, the company may or may not update the phones to the latest Android version. The Pixel phones will continue to get security updates for at least three years or at least 18 months from the last device sold, whichever is longer. So the Pixel and XL will at max get security updates until October 2019. Google’s Pixel phones released last fall came with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Later this year, they will get Android O, and in 2018, they will be eligible for Android P. After that there is no guarantee on whether they will get the 2019 Android version. Android O is already available as a beta for the Pixel and Pixel XL. The final version is expected to come this fall, probably with the launch of the new Pixel phones. Devices bought from Google Store to get updates sooner Google did inform consumers about its update plans at the launch of the phones also, saying they will get guaranteed software updates until 2018, notes IndianExpress. It confirmed the same thing on its support page: “Pixel phones get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device became available on the Google Store. After 2 years, we can’t guarantee additional updates.” The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X will get Android version updates until September 2017, while security updates will come until September 2018. Other devices like the Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus 6 smartphone will get security updates until October 2017 and Android version updates till October 2016. The company says Google Play edition devices “get updates from the device manufacturers, not directly from Google.” The Android One devices will “get the latest version of Android from Google’s hardware partners.” Further, according to Google’s “Check & update your Android version” page, the Pixel phones will get the latest Android version directly from the company.

The crime was perpetrated by Evaldas Rimasauskas of Lithuania. Rimasauskas was able to fleece both companies by forging all sorts of documents and other materials and authorizations that allowed him to accurately impersonate tech suppliers for the two companies and solicit huge payments. He was eventually caught and authorities even manged to return a good portion of the money that he stole, but the records were sealed to the public. A lengthy investigation by Fortune brought the facts of the case to light. Rimasauskas allegedly avoided detection over the years the scam was taking place by distributing the money around to different banks throughout Europe. He impersonated Quanta Computer, a Taiwanese outfit established in 1988, which regularly sold bits and bobs to both Facebook and Google. While unnamed in the investigation, Quanta stepped forward to confirm that they were the company being impersonated, and said that the second party in the case was actually two parties; an international tech giant, and a social media provider. After questions were asked in private, “multiple sources” ended up naming Facebook and Google as the victims. Both companies eventually wound up coming forward and confirming that they had been victimized, and also that they had both managed to get back most of the funds that they paid out. The implications of this event run deep. For starters, it serves as proof that a properly launched social engineering assault can compromise even the most secure companies. The second, bigger implication speaks to a term known as a “material event” in the business world. A material event is something that causes a significant change in the way the company does business, or something that has deep implications for the company. Reports that Yahoo had been hacked, for example, were a material event. When a material event occurs, companies are obligated to let shareholders know. Though they aren’t obligated to tell the public in most cases, material events are often revealed via press releases. In light of the facts of the case coming out, debate rages as to whether the crime reported would be considered a material event, and indeed what the criteria are in general for a material event. Google and Facebook both kept their mouths shut about the case until the facts were dragged into the light, and when asked, both companies said that they did not see the theft as a material event.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter Shares of Alphabet Inc. were up 5% midday Friday, a day after the company beat first-quarter earnings expectations, and as many Wall Street analysts followed by raising price targets. Google sites led Alphabet Inc.’s earnings as the primary driver of revenue and many analysts see greater revenue growth ahead, coming from added advertising streams as well as Google’s YouTube site. But there is concern that Google’s traffic acquisition costs (TAC) as a percentage of revenue will continue to increase. Shares of Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71%  have gained 10.4% in the past three months, compared with the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.19%   gain of 3.9%. See also: Google survives YouTube ad controversy for now The average stock price target of the 46 analysts surveyed by FactSet increased to $1,031.36 on Friday, or about 9.4% above current levels, from an average of $982.26 before earnings were released. Here’s what analysts said: • Despite the earnings beat, Wedbush analysts are concerned about growing pressure from the sites’ traffic-acquisition costs. Alphabet’s TAC as a percentage of sites revenue increased this quarter, the analysts said, and in the future management said it expects the overall percentage to continue to grow. Wedbush analysts raised their price target to $725, based on the earnings beat, but reiterated an underperform rating on the stock saying, “We see underappreciated risks to search advertising as substantial enough to support our rating.” • Pacific Crest analysts had a cheerier view of Alphabet’s revenue opportunities, saying there are further growth opportunities with YouTube TV as well as with Google Cloud. Those two segments look to be beating non-search revenue at Google in terms of growth, they said. The analysts raised their price target to $1,100 from $1,040 and reiterated an outperform rating. • Susquehanna analysts see coming ad catalysts with device-specific bidding, advertising in Google’s local maps and the addition of a fourth advertisement at the top of its search page. Management’s tighter expense control as well as more share allocations should also improve sentiment around the stock. The analysts increased their price target to $1,200 from $1,000 and maintained a positive rating on the stock. • Alphabet’s tighter expense control, as evidenced by stable Google segment operating margins, should help soothe investor fears of greater investments later on, said UBS analysts. The analysts raised their price target to $1,050 from $950 and reiterated a buy rating. • RBC Capital Markets analysts said Alphabet’s earnings beat showed “more evidence of the sustainable fruit” of having an efficient management team and organizational structure. Alphabet highlighted mobile growth, with 44% year-over-year growth in paid clicks. “Alphabet just printed its 29th straight quarter of 20%ish organic revenue growth. We believe this is unprecedented, especially for an asset of this size,” said Mark Mahaney, lead analyst on the report. RBC analysts raised their price target to $1,050 from $1,025 and reiterated an outperform rating. • One other negative hanging over Alphabet has been controversy with advertisements appearing alongside controversial videos on YouTube. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt, said he believes the issue has blown over and that management, including Chief Executive Sundar Pichai’s comments on the earnings call, have adequately addressed it. “We believe those concerns are alleviated at this point, with clear focus and interest evident that addressing content issues is a top priority,” Cakmak wrote. He raised his price target to $1,050 from $900 and reiterated a buy rating, saying he believes Alphabet is the “most favorable risk-reward tradeoff in large cap tech.” More from MarketWatch Elon Musk: Self-driving Teslas will go between LA and NYC by the end of the year My boyfriend wants to pay me $500 in rent — and live for free when I’ve paid my mortgage Film Trailer: 'Dunkirk' Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing Quote References GOOGL +33.08 +3.71% SPX -4.57 -0.19% Most Popular These Americans will never get Social Security benefits — and we don’t mean millennials It’s harder than you think to spend down your 401(k) account in retirement Dow’s rally from election to Trump’s first 100 days is a postwar record Elon Musk: Self-driving Teslas will go between LA and NYC by the end of the year France's Presidential Election: What You Need to Know Caitlin Huston Caitlin Huston is a MarketWatch reporter based in New York.

News of two major tech firms being tricked by a Lithuanian man into sending him over $100m first came to light last month, but Fortune has this week revealed that the two firms in question are only bloody Facebook and Google.  Both firms have since confirmed that this in the case. Facebook, which managed to recuperate the bulk of the stolen $100m, said in a statement: "We recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation." Google said it had "detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities", adding that it "recouped the funds" and is "pleased this matter is resolved." The scammer responsible, 48-year-old Evaldas Rimasauskas,  deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015 by masquerading as Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Quanta Computer which supplies parts for Apple Watch and Amazon's Kindle devices. In March, when news of the high-profile scam first came to light, he was charged with wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. "From half a world away, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly targeted multinational internet companies and tricked their agents and employees into wiring over $100 million to overseas bank accounts under his control," Acting US Attorney Joon H Kim said in March when the DoJ announced the arrest of Rimasauskas. "This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies - even the most sophisticated - that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cybercriminals. And this arrest should serve as a warning to all cyber criminals that we will work to track them down, wherever they are, to hold them accountable." Rimasauskas was arrested is currently fighting extradition to the US, arguing that he was treated badly by the FBI officers who interrogated him and that he will not get a fair and impartial trial. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Security Security Facebook Google scam Hacking phishing INQ Latest Facebook admits that political groups have abused it for propaganda purposes No shit Sherlock Communications 28 April 2017 Google Updates: Michelin stars, foreign restaurants and tasteless flying machines Plus there's a big bad Google Pixel 2 on the way.

Louisville mayor Greg Fischer told a local newspaper this week that Google Fiber is finally on the way, about a year and a half after Google said it was exploring bringing the service to the Kentucky city. Google confirmed that it was starting to build out the new service. "The start of construction is an exciting moment for Google Fiber in Louisville," Google said in a statement. "Building a new fiber network is a big job, and we’re grateful for the continued patience and support of the city’s residents and leaders." Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Google Fiber is part of the company Access, under the umbrella of Google's holding company Alphabet. The fiber service last year saw longtime CEO Craig Barratt depart without being immediately replaced as it halted expansion in new cities and laid off almost 10% of its staff. In February, Google hired a new CEO, wireless industry veteran Gregory McCray, though amid reports of further layoffs. The gigabit Internet service is currently offered in nine metropolitan areas, including Austin, Kansas City and Salt Lake City. Google now lists Louisville, Huntsville, Ala., and San Antonio, Texas as three "upcoming" cities where the company is committed to bring service but hasn't begun serving customers yet, a spokeswoman said. One challenge for Google (googl) in Louisville may be a lawsuit that AT&T (t) filed to block city rules that make it easier for new service providers to attach equipment to telephone poles owned by AT&T and others. The lawsuit charges the city lacks jurisdiction to impose pole attachment rules. AT&T says it already offers its own super-high-speed, fiber optic-based Internet service to over 50,000 locations Louisville and surrounding areas.

Zeman   @phonescooper Samsung's new virtual reality headset adds a controller, which dramatically helps improve usability. Together with a Galaxy smartphone, the Gear VR and controller will allow you to dive headfirst into exciting virtual worlds. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review. AD       article continues below... Intro Samsung's revised Gear VR headset adds a controller and other creature comforts that vastly improve the experience of exploring new worlds through virtual reality. If you're in the market for a high-end Galaxy smartphone, the Gear VR with controller is a must-have accessory. Background The original Gear VR headset is a great tool for VR. Developed jointly with Facebook-owned Oculus, it's one of the more advanced phone-centric headsets available. Together with a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+, I marveled at the content Samsung, Facebook, and Oculus assembled at the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last August. As much as I enjoyed the experience, I found the head-mounted controls on the exterior of the headset awkward to use. I often pressed the wrong button, overshot my target, and ended up somewhere I didn't want to be. The Gear VR was a good, but somewhat flawed, headset. The Gear VR is now in its second generation of hardware. This new model takes a big leap forward in usability thanks to the addition of a controller similar to the one included with Google's Daydream VR headset. What's so great about a controller? With the controller in one hand, it's far quicker and easier to navigate through the various menus and user interface screens to get to the content you want. In fact, once you jump to a VR headset with a controller, you'll never want to go back to one without. It's a transformative leap, one that Samsung was smart enough to bring to the Gear VR this year alongside the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Hardware The Gear VR is an intimidating, futuristic-looking piece of hardware that feels like it belongs in a sci-fi movie. I can easily see a spaceship crew donning the Gear VR to remotely examine the wreckage of a downed craft on Planet XYZ. Yes, it's that geeky. It's all hard plastics, angles, and space-like blackness. In contrast, Google's DayDream is covered in soft felt; it feels more personal and natural. The Gear VR with controller is just a smidge bigger than the original headset, and yet it absolutely dwarfs Google's DayDream. The Gear VR a clunky piece of gear that won't necessarily travel well. (If you're curious to know the dimensions, it's 8.2 by 4.8 by 3.9 inches.) Gear VR   You'll have to assemble the headset to a small degree. None of the straps are attached, and figuring out which elastic nylon band goes where is a bit of a puzzle. Adjusting the straps to fit your head requires some trial and error, but most people should be able to find a comfortable balance with just a few moments of effort. A foam pad lines the surface where the headset makes contact with your face. It helps block out light. There's enough space between your face and the lenses to accommodate most eyeglasses. The original Gear had a large piece of black plastic on front that went over the phone. The new Gear gets rid of this large plastic protector. Instead, a smaller piece of plastic covers the lenses when the headset is not in use. This design leaves the phone's camera exposed, opening up possibilities for AR (augmented reality) and mixed-reality. The Gear VR with controller is compatible with a wide range of Samsung's top phones. I tested it with a Galaxy S8, S8+, S7, and S6 edge+. It worked equally well with all these phones. Opposing clamps lock your phone in place. One of the clamps includes a male USB connector for your phone. (The headset itself draws a small amount of power from the phone sop the buttons work, etc.) Out of the box, the USB connector is USB-C, but it can be swapped for microUSB if you have an older Galaxy handset, thanks to an in-box accessory. The clamps do their job and hold the phone in place firmly. It's a bit like docking a ship at your local space station. If you have a case on your phone, you'll need to take it off before putting the phone into the Gear VR. A rotating dial on top allows you to fine-tune focus. The dial is a cinch to find and use, and works as it should. Several buttons adorn the right edge of the headset, including a volume toggle, back and home buttons, and a touchpad for controlling the pointer. These controls duplicate what's on the separate controller and allow you to use the Gear VR if you happen to lose the controller. I'd call the buttons well defined and easy enough to use. You'll simply have to get used to their positioning over time. The touchpad area is larger and more sensitive than the original, which makes using it simpler and more effective. You'll find a USB-C port on the bottom of the headset. This allows you to attach a power cable to the Gear VR while you use it. (VR drains the heck out of your battery.) Plugging the headset in is optional: it's simply a way to assure that your phone doesn't die while using the Gear VR. Phone Fit   The controller is small, rounded, and fits in your hand well. It's slightly angled with large multi-directional pad at the top, home and back buttons, and a volume toggle. The circular pad mirrors the touch-based functionality of the one on the headset itself. It works a bit like a mouse, allowing you to more finely point and click on things. Googlke's DayDream doesn't have this feature in its controller. I'm glad the Gear VR back and home buttons have different shapes: the former is convex while the latter is concave. This makes them a breeze to tell apart. The volume toggle is long and narrow. The action of all the buttons is fine. There's a gaming-style trigger button on the top edge of the controller. Controller   The controller connects to your phone via Bluetooth. I takes just a few seconds to pair the two. The controller acts a lot like a laser pointer; it's a virtual pointer / selector. It's always pointing at something. Use the buttons to click on what you want. You will need to calibrate it upon initial use, and then once a week or so to ensure it's accurate. Calibrating the controller takes maybe 10 seconds. Calibration   My biggest gripe about the controller is that there's no place to store it in the headset itself. The Daydream controller stows nicely inside the headset so it won't get lost. There is no place to stow the Gear VR's controller. This is an odd oversight. Further, it relies on two AAA batteries. This just sucks, especially since there's no obvious battery meter. (The controller in the Daydream View has an internal battery that can be recharged via USB.) I hate relying on removable batteries. Software The Gear VR will prompt you to download all the required software the first time you stick your phone into the headset. Once the downloads are installed, you'll find an Oculus app on your phone that includes a content store. The store offers apps, experiences, games, imagery, video, and more. Much of it is free, though app pricing varies. Store   It's perhaps easiest to discover apps in the phone-based app, rather than the one in the VR environment. The phone Oculus app lets you swiftly bomb through the store as you would any other on-device app store. Samsung claims there are more than 700 Gear VR-compatible apps available. You can also download apps from the Oculus Store directly through the headset. I've tested a handful of VR apps before on various platforms. I was somewhat easily to find apps via the phone apps and via the VR environment. The apps I tested, such as Discovery VR, Netflix, and Facebook 360, work well enough. A quad-HD screen is key for any VR setup. Even with the Galaxy S8+'s high resolution (slightly better than quad-HD) screen, I could see individual pixels through the Gear VR. But this is still true of even the most high-end dedicated VR headsets, so for now, it's part of the experience. Oculus Apps   The Gear VR's core user interface — or “home screen”, if you will — is a curved grid of connected apps and services that float in front of you. The arrangement of this home screen is a little chaotic, but after a while you'll get used to where everything is. You need to turn your head side-to-side to see everything. The Oculus Store and Gear VR settings tools are always available from this screen. Using the controller, you aim at the app or item you want to select and press the button. It's fairly easy to exit apps and return to the home screen to pick something else. You simply have to explore. Much like Google's Daydream, the Gear VR will automatically find all the existing 360-degree and VR content that's on your phone, no matter the app it happens to be in. For example, I used a 360-degree camera to capture imagery during a recent trip to Lisbon. The Oculus software located and loaded all those photos from my phone's gallery into the Gear 360 VR gallery app. It will also do this with pictures and video you've taken with apps such as Google's Cardboard Camera. The software didn't run as smoothly as I'd like. I noticed some jankiness in the core user interface, as well as within apps. There was some stuttering, some pauses, and some crashes. It's hard to say what's at fault here. Without question, the Galaxy S8+ I used for most of the testing should be up to the task of running VR content. It could be bugs in the Oculus app. Every phone I used with the Gear VR became warm to the touch. Moreover, you'll notice that battery life drops precipitously when immersed in VR. Plug the headset itself into a power source for extended VR sessions. Similar to other VR headsets I've used, sound can be problematic (especially if you're sharing with others.) Much of the sound that accompanies VR content is recorded in stereo, if not some form of surround sound. None of Samsung's handsets have stereo speakers, which means sound projects out one side (generally to the right). This degrades the experience a lot. You can resolve this by using headphones, such as the Samsung noise-cancelling Level Ones. You'll have to supply your own headphones. The Gear VR provides space for regular, wired headphones for most of Samsung's handsets, including the S8 and S8+, but Bluetooth is probably your best bet. The fewer wires the better. Last, it's worth pointing out that not all the content in the Oculus store is compatible with the controller. There's a dedicated section that says "Controller Ready". The rest of the apps require you to use the controls that are placed on the headset itself. This leads to a disjointed experience, as you need to keep jumping back and forth between input methods depending on the app you're using. This problem should eventually go away as developers update their apps with controller support. Discussion It's still early days for virtual reality, but things are improving at a rapid pace. The Gear VR with Controller solves some of the usability problems of the original and moves the bar just a bit higher. The headset itself is big and clunky, but it covers the basics. It affixes firmly to your head, offers a nice selection of controls, and is compatible with a wide range of top-end Samsung handsets. I like that the Gear VR accommodates phones with both USB-C and microUSB, can accommodate eyeglasses, and lets you power your phone during use. The controller takes the experience to a new level, but it's not without its own faults. Samsung missed the mark by neglecting to find a place within the headset to store the controller, and who wants to worry about AAA batteries to keep the controller powered up? Oculus' software is powerful and generally works as intended. Most everyone should be able to find and enjoy the virtual reality content that interests them. The selection will only improve. Samsung is selling the Gear VR with Controller for $129, but many wireless carriers are bundling it for free with the purchase of a new Galaxy S8 or S8+. If you're buying one of these newer phones, be sure to take advantage of the free headset offer before it expires. If you own one of Samsung's older flagship phones and have been holding off on exploring VR, the Gear VR is your best bet for jumping into new worlds.

Gadgets Mobiles Apps Gaming Internet Social Media More OS Companies Connect with us HiTechGazette Gadgets Mobiles Apps Gaming Internet Social Media More OS Companies Alphabet (Google) grows more than expected and eliminates doubts about advertiser leaks Share Tweet Companies Alphabet (Google) grows more than expected and eliminates doubts about advertiser leaks By Liam Davis Published on April 28, 2017 Share Tweet Comment We are in the time of presenting fiscal results for the first quarter of 2017. Now Alphabet has also presented its fiscal results, in that Google is responsible for the vast majority of its revenues after the company grouped their projects to manage them more efficiently. Let’s see these results in more detail. Fiscal results for Alphabet (Google) in the first quarter of 2017 Analysts initially expected Alphabet to have earnings $7.40 per share compared to $7.50 last year. Reported earnings are $7.73 per share that far exceeded investor’s expectations and amounted to $5.430 billion. In terms of income, Alphabet was expected to make $24.2 billion. Reported revenues are $24.750 billion, representing a total growth of 22% over the same period last year. This growth has been fueled by a rise in revenue on mobile ads and on YouTube. Alphabet has a growing trend of over 20% in the last three quarters, which is uncommon for a company that has been in the market for so many years. However, this quarter could have been a bit different as at the end of March many brands withdrew their investments in advertising after some media claimed that Google was placing ads alongside offensive content. Among those brands were Coca-Cola and Walmart. Google did not comment on how much this affected their accounts but what it did was give more control on platforms like YouTube to the brands for where they could and could not place their ads. Finally all this amounted for nothing as Alphabet continues to grow unstoppable as it has for so many years now. Cost per click repeats pattern: decreases as clicks increase The cost per click has not stopped growing since the introduction of smartphones, as there are more users, more searches, and hence more clicks on the ads. The problem is that advertisers spend less money on mobile ads which decreased the amount of money Google makes on per click. The cost per click dropped 19% compared to the same period in 2016. As we have seen, the cost per click continues to fall as the number of clicks increases. In particular, the clicks have grown 44% when compared to the first quarter of 2016. Google search app android 99% of Alphabet’s revenue came from Google while the “Other Bets” section generated a total loss of $855 million that included subsections such as the self-contained car or home thermostats. This segment posted $244 million up from $165 million in the first quarter of 2016. However as we saw the losses were also higher. These results have caused a sudden rise in the afterhours of writing the news. This rise at the moment is of 4% that assumes the value of per share has shot up from the $891 per share at the closing of the bag to $930 per share, this being its historical maximum in the stock market.

Ginny Marvin on April 28, 2017 at 12:59 pm More Merkle’s Digital Marketing Report for Q1 points to strong growth from Google and the continued strength of PLAs (Google Product Listing Ads). Expanded text ads have yet to yield promises of CTR gold. Bing and Yahoo’s lack of mobile market share is hampering growth. Here’s a look at some of the key trends from the report. (Keep in mind the data reflects spending from Merkle’s own client base, which skews large retailer.) AdWords Q1 year-over-year growth outpaced that of Q4 Spending on Google AdWords increased 21 percent year over year in Q1 2017, up from 19 percent in Q4 2016. Click volume increased 20 percent over the previous year. CPCs ticked up 1 percent. Merkle credits the addition of a fourth mobile text ad, PLAs in image search, Google Maps ads and the return of separate device bids as key contributors to growth over the past year. Tablet bids fall, mobile bids improve relative to desktop Tablet bids have steadily declined relative to desktop since Google enabled advertisers to bid separately on the two devices last summer. Merkle says decoupling tablets from desktop helped drive growth, with advertisers able to adjust bids separately for higher-value desktop clicks. Google AdWords phone and desktop spend increased 51 percent and 12 percent, respectively, while tablet spend fell 23 percent. Phone CPCs continued to gain ground on desktop in Q1. For non-brand queries, phone CPCs were 43 percent lower than desktop CPCs in Q1, compared to being 51 percent lower in Q4. Tablet CPCs were 25 percent lower than desktop in Q1, down from near-parity in early 2016, when the devices were combined in bidding. Source: Merkle PLAs keep growing faster than text ads With 52 percent click share, PLAs accounted for more than half of retail search ad clicks in Q1, up from 48 percent in Q4. For non-brand queries, PLAs drove a whopping 75 percent of all clicks for retailers. Spending on Google Shopping rose by 32 percent year over year in Q1, compared to 12 percent for text ads. Growing impression volume on mobile is helping to increase PLA click share, and growth was largely driven by non-brand queries. Source: Merkle Search partners, which includes Google image search, accounted for 11 percent of PLA clicks for the quarter, similar to Q4’s share. Local Inventory Ads gaining traction In Q1, Local Inventory Ads (LIA) accounted for 19 percent of all Google Shopping clicks on phones. CTRs on LIAs are 19 percent higher than PLAs on phone and desktop. Not surprisingly, online conversion rates for LIAs, which are designed to direct store traffic, are lower than PLAs. CTR boost for expanded text ads (ETAs) remains elusive Merkle has consistently reported seeing mixed results since ETAs first came on the scene last year. The Q1 results for ETAs show a CTR lift compared to standard text ads only on desktop ads shown at the bottom of the page. After accounting for device, keyword type, and ad location, there is still no clear evidence that Expanded Text Ads are producing consistently higher click-through rates than the legacy Google text ad format. Source: Merkle; high-traffic ad groups with both formats active in Q1 Overall, text ad spending on Google increased by 12 percent. However, non-brand text ad spending rose 16 percent year over year. Merkle says the fourth mobile ad unit and the addition of ads in Google Maps has done more to buoy text ad growth than format changes. Bing & Yahoo mobile troubles Across Bing Ads and Yahoo Gemini, spend fell by 14 percent compared to the previous year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of spend declines. With Google as the default search option on Android and iOS devices, mobile weakness continues to be a considerable handicap for Bing and Yahoo. Google accounted for 97 percent of mobile phone traffic in Q1. Bing and Yahoo clicks made up 19 percent of desktop clicks for the quarter.

The future of local discovery Columnist Brian Smith discusses some of the recent developments and technology that will impact local search, both in the short term and the long term. Brian Smith on April 28, 2017 at 9:41 am More We’ve entered an exciting time for local marketing. Big Data, digital assistants, augmented reality and beacons will fundamentally change the way users discover locations. As Bob Dylan so aptly pointed out, “The times they are a-changin’.” As such, local marketers and advertisers need to start thinking about how they’re going to change along with the times. Here’s what you need to know about the future of local discovery. Big Data: ‘Who’ informs ‘where’ Proximity is the primary ranking factor in local searches. That’s not likely to change. After all, what’s nearby is the fundamental aspect of local discovery. What is changing, however, is the filter that sorts out, ranks and presents those nearby locations. What filter, you ask? It’s you. Going forward, local discovery will function as proximity filtered by your individual preferences. The person searching will inform what locations are shown. In truth, this is nothing new. Google, Bing, Safari and Yahoo have been personalizing search results for some time through tracking your browsing history. What is new is the sophistication of artificial intelligence and Big Data analytics. With the burgeoning Internet of Things, the amount of customer and behavioral data is growing by the day. Even if Congress hadn’t cleared the way for internet services providers (ISPs) to sell your data, what marketers and advertisers know about customers was only going to increase thanks to the growing data fiefdoms of Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. For good or ill, the ability to use that information to target the right customer with the right message at the right time is maturing. In fact, even back in 2012 ,Target had the capability to use data mining to predict the pregnancy of a teenager before her father could deduce the news himself. Big Data has come a long way since then. In the case of local discovery, Big Data will help search engines personalize local results based on a user’s preference. The more the search engines know about you, the more relevant search results and maps will be. For example, a search for nearby restaurants might include ranking factors such as your favorite dishes, food allergies, price point, time of day and how long it was since your last visit. Meanwhile, a search for a nearby product such as shoes might be filtered by your favorite brand, shoe color, size and any ongoing sales. However, knowing your customer and targeting your customer are two different things. There needs to be a means of surfacing local information in a unified way, and that need will undoubtedly be addressed by digital assistants. Digital assistants and voice search Digital assistants will serve as the connection between customer profiles and the preferred locations and products around them. Digital assistants will be everywhere. On your phone, in your car, your house, your office — everywhere and inside everything connected to the internet. The ultimate goal of Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri is to become that universal connection between the physical and digital worlds. In the context of local discovery, think of a digital assistant as your very own personal Rick Steves, providing you with everything you’d ever care to know about a location — and then some. This omnipresent assistant, part tour guide, part planner, part shopping liaison, will provide users with the most relevant and personalized local recommendations for anything you can imagine. And thanks to voice search, digital assistants are always listening. Google Home and Amazon Alexa operate in this mode by default, and Apple’s latest iPhone update is pushing users to set up voice activation for Siri. In addition to enabling ambient listening, voice activation establishes voice biometrics, which will allow digital assistants to become device-agnostic. Whether it’s smart cars, smart homes or smart offices, the ability to distinguish between users is critical to translating your personal preferences regardless of location or device. This will provide a consistent user experience without a disruption to conversational context. In fact, Google Home recently made progress on this front by being able to recognize up to six different voices from one device. It’s not hard to extrapolate this trend to the point that digital assistants will be able to recognize who you are regardless of where or what device you’re using. Soon you’ll be able to make dinner reservations by talking to the digital assistant embedded in your hotel room, order an Uber from the digital assistant on your phone as you walk to the lobby and check your flight from the digital assistant inside your autonomous Uber — all without breaking the conversational context with your digital assistant. Augmented reality With the rise of voice search, it’s also necessary to replace the traditional screen on your phone and monitor. A picture is worth a thousand words, so it’s unlikely that even a sweet-talking digital assistant will replace our need to visualize what’s in front of us. As I outlined in a previous article, the solution to traditional screens is to replace them with augmented reality — your smartphone transforming into smart glasses. Based on Facebook’s recent plans for augmented reality, this indeed seems to be the direction we’re heading. In my mind, augmented reality is likely to be one of the more exciting and less privacy-invasive developments of local discovery. You’ll be able to scout out a local restaurant, visualize the precise location of a product on a shelf or interact with custom location-based content triggered with beacons. Which brings me to the final trend you should be keeping an eye on. Beacons Proximity targeting will flourish with the rise of augmented reality and digital assistants. Beacons are perfect for surfacing content in a user’s immediate proximity. The challenge right now is alerting users to beacons. However, if everyone has a digital assistant embedded in their augmented reality glasses, it will be easy for users to discover beacon content and have that content personalized based on personal preferences. Whether it’s triggering a coupon for a customer’s most likely purchase as he walks by a store entrance or promoting a fast food restaurant as a vehicle exits the interstate off-ramp, the potential for beacons is tremendous. Start preparing now Many of these developments might seem too far out in the future. However, technology is evolving at an exponential rate. The time to start preparing and laying the groundwork for these marketing developments is now.

Google doodle celebrates Marie Harel, the inventor of Camembert cheese Check out the cheesy Google logo on their home page today. Barry Schwartz on April 28, 2017 at 10:29 am More Today’s special Google doodle honors the inventor of the Camembert cheese. Marie Harel was born 256 years ago today in Crouttes, France. She invented the Camembert cheese back in 1791, at the age of 30. The Google doodle shows the steps it takes to make Camembert cheese in nine different Google logo slides. Google said that the “Doodle celebrates Harel’s 256th birthday with a slideshow that illustrates how Camembert is made, step by step.” “It’s drawn in a charming, nostalgic style reminiscent of early 20th-century French poster artists, such as Hervé Morvan and Raymond Savignac,” they added. Her work earned her a statue in Vimoutiers in France. Marie Harel lived to the age of 83 and died on November 9, 1844.

Barry Schwartz on April 28, 2017 at 11:46 am More Google revamped its How Search Works site, the site they launched in 2013 to describe the efforts Google makes in search. Google added some new metrics around the various Google search launches they made last year, how many tests they tried out and the various numbers around their diverse set of search experiments. Google mentioned the update to this site when they also announced Project Owl earlier this week. The site shares that Google launched 1,653 new search changes last year, based on 9,800 live traffic experiments, 18,015 side-by-side experiments and 130,336 search quality tests. As you can see, only a small percentage of what Google tries actually goes live, but to launch over 1,600 new changes in search in a single year is massive. In fact, we don’t know exactly how many of the 1,600 changes are user interface changes versus new feature changes versus algorithmic or ranking changes. I doubt Google would share those details. What we do know is that only one percent of searchers were part of the 9,800 live traffic experiments and that while we likely covered many of them, I am sure we missed the majority of those experiments.

This week another possible solution emerged — this time from someone with significant experience with how platforms deal with news. On Thursday, Google News creator Krishna Bharat published a Medium post that outlined a way that platforms could use a combination of algorithms and human editors to cut off certain stories as they begin to gain traction through shares, searches, and other types of engagement. He describes this phenomenon as a wave. Given the scale of social media, Bharat wrote that it makes most sense for the platforms to address waves that display attributes associated with fake news once they’ve hit a certain threshold: To make this concrete: Let us say that a social media platform has decided that it wants to fully address fake news by the time it gets 10,000 shares. To achieve this they may want to have the wave flagged at 1,000 shares, so that human evaluators have time to study it and respond. For search, you would count queries and clicks rather than shares and the thresholds could be higher, but the overall logic is the same. To prove how this system could work, Bharat gave the example of the infamous false story that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump for president. Bharat says that the system could trigger editors when waves reach a certain scale. Ultimately, the algorithm would learn from the editors’ decisions and improve over time: To do this at scale, an algorithm would look at all recent articles (from known and obscure sources) that have been getting some play in the last 6–12 hours on a particular social network or search engine. To limit the scope we could require a match with some trigger terms (e.g., names of politicians, controversial topics) or news categories (e.g., politics, crime, immigration). This would reduce the set to around 10,000 articles. These articles can be analyzed and grouped into story buckets, based on common traits — significant keywords, dates, quotes, phrases, etc. None of this is technically complex. Computer Scientists have been doing this for decades and call this “document clustering.” Articles that land in a given story bucket would be talking about the same story. This technique has been used successfully in Google News and Bing News, to group articles by story and to compare publishing activity between stories. If two different sources mention “pope” and “Trump” and some variant of the term “endorsed” within a short time window then their articles will end up in the same bucket. This essentially helps us capture the full coverage of a story, across various news sources. Add in the social context, i.e., the posts that refer to these articles, and you have the full wave. Most importantly this allows us to figure out comprehensively which sources and authors are propagating this news and which are not. RELATED ARTICLE It turns out people are very bad at estimating the magnitude of the fake news problem April 28, 2017While Bharat’s solution might be a sensible way to address the problem of misinformation on the platforms, there’s another question about whether Facebook and Google will want to follow suit. Despite its white paper this week on how propaganda has thrived on the platform, Facebook has been reluctant to use human editors after its controversy last year. “The biggest challenge to stopping fake news is not technical,” Bharat wrote. “It is operational willingness.” Show tagsHide tags Show comments / Leave a commentHide comments Facebook fake news Google Google News Krishna Bharat misinformation   What’s the best way to follow how the news is changing?

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Amazon’s Echo with a screen tipped for May reveal Chris Davies - Apr 28, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Amazon may have split opinion this week with Echo Look, which encourages Alexa to watch you getting dressed, but it seems it’s not letting that slow the roll-out of new smart assistants. Echo Look is the fourth product on Amazon’s virtual shelves to use Alexa, following the original Echo smart speaker, the Tap portable Bluetooth version, and the compact and more affordable Echo Dot. As soon as next month, though, we could see a fifth addition to the line-up. Where Echo Look is intended to watch the user, the new Echo device goes in the opposite direction: it’s meant to be looked at. That’s because it’s said to be the first official Alexa product with a built-in display. Codenamed “Knight” internally, the production name for the product hasn’t been revealed at this stage. That hasn’t stopped rumors from circulating over the past months about its existence, mind. Chatter of a screen-bearing Echo began back in May 2016, with the device described at the time as a “tablet” though intended for use within the home rather than being used portably like Amazon’s existing Fire tablets. How close its actual form-factor will stick to the Fire slates is uncertain. We may not have long to wait to find out, though. According to sources speaking to CNET, Amazon could launch “Knight” as early as May 2017. That timescale might change, and Amazon wouldn’t comment on the rumors, but the insider suggests momentum within the company is strong to get it out sooner rather than later. That’s apparently down to Google, and recent updates to Google Home. Although it launched significantly later than the original Amazon Echo, Google Home has since outpaced it in a number of ways. Not least, Google added the ability to distinguish between several different users by voice alone in an update that began to roll out earlier this month. It’s something Alexa can’t yet do and, given Amazon pitches Echo as the perfect foil to a family home, it’s embarrassing to be beaten to the feature by its rival. What Google doesn’t yet offer is a home assistant speaker with a display – though the Google Assistant does run on Android smartphones, much as Alexa can accessed on Fire tablets and in the Amazon app for iOS and Android – which Amazon may be looking to get the jump on. Although Alexa’s functionality has, until now, been focused on doing things via voice alone, a display opens several potential avenues for future features. While you can shop for products with the current Echo, it’s a fairly clumsy process unless you’re simply reordering previous purchases. With its display, “Knight” could show a selection of possibilities to enhance the shopping experience. Meanwhile, though it’s unclear exactly what features will be included, a display could also allow the device to support video calling. Rumors earlier this year suggested Amazon could mount the display on a posable arm, akin to the Apple iMac G4. Given Echo Look has a camera, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched that the new Echo home tablet could get the same, including offering the fashion assessments that have made the peeping gadget announced this week all the more contentious.

According to an investigation by Fortune, Lithuanian Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly forged email addresses, invoices, and corporate stamps in order to impersonate a large Asian-based manufacturer with whom the tech firms regularly did business. Over two years, he is allegef to have convinced accounting departments at the two tech companies to make transfers worth tens of millions of dollars. By the time the firms figured out what was going on, Rimasauskas had coaxed out over $100 million in payments, which he promptly stashed in bank accounts across Eastern Europe. Spokespeople for Google and Facebook this week confirmed that they were the victims in question. Facebook claimed that it “recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation”, while a Google spokesperson said: “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved.” Mark James, IT security specialist at ESET, said: “It’s a fact in today’s digital world that there is always someone trying to scam you. We fight it, we delete it, we even highlight it and use it to teach others what to look out for, but there is one thing humans are good at and that’s adapting. Most spam or phishing attacks end up a failure, but that’s the nature of these types of attacks they don’t all have to succeed. “For us to be safe we have to detect or block 100% of those attempts but they only need to get one right. If someone puts their mind to doing something there is a good chance they will succeed, whether that’s education, business or foul deeds. The good thing about the latter is most of the time people get caught. This particular plan involved forging email addresses, invoices, and corporate stamps in order to trick some big companies into believing they are dealing with the ‘right’ company and handing over thousands, it just goes to prove that all companies large and small can be scammed.” Lee Munson, security researcher at Comparitech, said: “Phishing or, more appropriately in this case ‘CEO Fraud’, poses a huge problem to organizations of all sizes. While technical controls have a small part to play in reducing the likelihood of such an attack being successful, it is staff awareness training that is key here. “While current disclosure laws may not require the victims in this case to come clean about what happened - from a financial point of view - I certainly believe there is a public interest angle. Investors in technology firms have a right to know that the business is managing its systems and people in an effective way that minimises risks that can have a significant impact - and CEO Fraud is relatively easy to identify and avoid - especially in this case, where the scam was allowed to continue unchecked over a two-year period.” Why Not Watch? 29 Jan 2015Sony Pictures Entertainment: The Fallout from 2014’s Biggest Breach 24 Mar 2016Robots Lead the Fightback – Investigating Automated Incident Response 9 Jul 2015How Outsiders Become Insiders: Understanding and Combating Today's Threats 2 Apr 2015Browsers, Certificates and Trust: What's Changing and What You Need to Know Related to This Story New approach to online banking takes authentication out of the browser Facebook Fan Page phishing scam aims to hijack accounts Tax fraud season: IRS warns of ID theft, charity scams Another new phishing scam appears on Facebook Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson reports on a new Facebook phishing vector What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?

In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against “two US-based internet companies” who were not named at the time. They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer’s bank accounts. On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google. The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015. “Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company,” the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March. These emails purported to be from employees of the Asia-based firm, the DOJ alleged, and were sent from email accounts designed to look like they had come from the company, but in fact had not. The DOJ also accused Mr Rimasauskas of forging invoices, contracts and letters “that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies”. “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities,” a spokeswoman for Google said in a statement. “We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved.” However, the firm did not reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped. Nor did Facebook – but a spokeswoman said: “Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.” Big firms targeted “Sometimes staff [at large firms] think that they are defended, that security isn’t part of their job,” said James Maude at cyber-security firm Avecto, commenting on the phishing threat facing big companies. “But people are part of the best security you can have – that’s why you have to train them.” He also told the BBC that Avecto’s clients have recounted phishing attempts that used senior staff’s hacked email accounts to convince employees that a request to wire out money was genuine. The sophistication of phishing scams has increased lately, according to a recent Europol report. “CEO fraud” – in which executives are impersonated by the scammer – was a particular worry. “The request is usually time-sensitive and often coincides with the close of business hours to make verification of the request difficult,” the report explained. “Such attacks often take advantage of publicly reported events such as mergers, where there may be some degree of internal flux and uncertainty.” In order to avoid succumbing to such fraud, firms are advised to carefully verify new payment requests before authorising them. – Source: BBC Facebook Google Godwin Akweiteh Allotey Tagged with: Facebook Google More on citifmonline.com Ransomware attacks around the world grow by 50% April 28, 2017 Cash offered after drones disrupt flights in China April 27, 2017 Hackers used Microsoft Word bug ‘for months’ April 27, 2017 Fitbit investigates report of ‘exploding’ tracker April 27, 2017 Google search changes tackle fake news and hate speech April 26, 2017 WhatsApp group admins to face jail over fake news April 25, 2017 General News Jon Benjamin is a “media whore” – Apaak April 29, 2017 Former MP to sue UK High Commission over Visa fraud claims April 29, 2017 Cocaine went missing at Tema Port – Finder Editor insists April 29, 2017 140 security men deployed to flush out illegal miners in Ashanti April 29, 2017 Parliament’s image smeared again by ‘Visa fraud’ allegations – ACEPA April 29, 2017 Advertisement Recent Posts Jon Benjamin is a “media whore” – Apaak Former MP to sue UK High Commission over Visa fraud claims Cocaine went missing at Tema Port – Finder Editor insists Michelle Obama: ‘I won’t run for office’ for my children 140 security men deployed to flush out illegal miners in Ashanti Parliament’s image smeared again by ‘Visa fraud’ allegations – ACEPA VRA still owes gas suppliers – WAPCo Ghana open to business again – Bawumia to  investors US open to talks with North Korea Antonio Conte wants Chelsea, Tottenham to kick off at same time Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2017 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

By Colin Daileda2017-04-28 16:49:38 UTC A 48-year-old Lithuanian man named Evaldas Rimasauskas managed to defraud internet giants Facebook and Google of $100 million over a span of two years, according to Fortune and the United States Department of Justice. How'd he do it? A little email phishing, of course. SEE ALSO: Fox News execs accused of hacking host who alleged sexual harassment Rimasauskas set up several accounts in Latvia and Cyprus under the name of an Asian "computer hardware manufacturer" that does business with the search giant and the social giant, according to the Justice Department. Then he set up fake email accounts pretending to be representatives of the hardware company. He used those fake accounts to request money from Google and Facebook, who wired cash his way. That kind of cash may have caused some raised eyebrows at the banks into which Rimasauskas funneled the money, but he "forged invoices, contracts, and letters that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents" of Google and Facebook, according to the Justice Department. All that paperwork also came with official-looking Google and Facebook logos.  Once the money was in a bank account he owned, Rimasauskas sent it along to other accounts under his control in "Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong." The two companies eventually figured out they'd sent money to fraudulent accounts, at which point the FBI got involved. Now, Rimasauskas stands charged with three counts of money laundering as well as aggravated identity theft and wire fraud. If given the maximum sentence for each of these charges, he'd face more than 80 years in prison.  For now, he's facing extradition in Lithuania. According to Fortune, his lawyer says Rimasauskas "cannot expect a fair and impartial trial in the USA." “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities," a Google spokesperson wrote in an email.

The US Department of Justice last month announced details of a $100 million "fraudulent email compromise scheme" against two unnamed "multinational internet companies." Now, thanks to Fortune, we know the identity of those companies: Facebook and Google. Fortune on Thursday, citing an unnamed person familiar with the investigation, reported that Facebook approached the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan asking for help recovering the millions it lost in the scheme. Facebook in a statement confirmed it was one of the fraud victims. "Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation," a company spokesperson told PCMag. Google also this week confirmed it was a victim. "We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities," a Google spokesperson told Fortune. "We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." Google did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. The new revelations come after the Justice Department last month announced the arrest of a Lithuanian Man named Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, who is charged with orchestrating an email scheme that tricked two "US-based internet companies" to wire more than $100 million to bank accounts he controlled. Related How to Recognize and Avoid Phishing Emails and Links How to Recognize and Avoid Phishing Emails and Links According to the indictment, Rimasauskas carried out the scheme from at least 2013 through 2015. The fraudster allegedly registered and incorporated a company in Latvia that "bore the same name as an Asian-based computer hardware manufacturer" with whom the US tech giants did business. He then spoofed emails to look like they were coming from the Asian supplier — identified last month as Taiwan's Quinta Computer — directing the US tech giants to make payments into his own bank accounts. Over the course of the scheme, he successfully tricked the victim companies into transferring more than $100 million into his own accounts. In other words, even tech giants like Facebook and Google fall for email scams. "This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies — even the most sophisticated — that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals," Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said in a statement last month.

TOM GRILLO NYT Technology April 28, 2017 11:49 AM Your next home Wi-Fi setup should be a mesh network By Brian X. Chen The New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The next time you upgrade your Wi-Fi equipment, take a bold step: Throw out your stand-alone router and invest in a so-called mesh system. A mesh network could solve most, if not all, of your Wi-Fi problems. It’s basically a system of multiple Wi-Fi stations that work together to blanket every corner of your home with a strong wireless data connection. Unlike stand-alone routers that lose signal the farther you move away from them, mesh stations piggyback on one another to create a wireless link throughout your home, minimizing the possibility of dead zones. The network technology is quickly becoming popular: After the startup Eero released a mesh system last year, bigger brands like Google and D-Link followed with similar products. Obviously, large houses would benefit from multiple Wi-Fi hubs. But experts also recommend them those with modestly sized homes. Mmesh Wi-Fi systems like Eero and Google Wifi include smartphone apps that make managing your network easier to understand. And some mesh systems just look good, – unlike traditional routers, which are bulky contraptions of antennas. Mesh networks also better accommodate a shift in how people use technology today — carrying smartphones, smart watches, laptops and tablets from room to room. Internet-connected gadgets like smart speakers, bathroom scales and smart televisions are also increasingly scattered throughout the home. “It’s really nice to see the router vendors doing something that is properly useful for once,” said Dave Fraser, the chief executive of Devicescape, a tech company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service. “It’s like they’ve finally realized it’s human beings buying these products rather than IT staff.” There are three popular Wi-Fi systems: Eero, Google Wifi and Netgear’s Orbi. Here’s what you need to know about mesh networks. Advantages of mesh First, a primer. You connect a primary base station to your broadband modem. From there, you connect satellite stations in other rooms. The primary base station retrieves data and bounces it to the satellite station, which then beams it to whatever device you’re using in what’s known as a hop. “It’s like taking a flight where you can’t fly direct, but you can fly indirectly through a hub,” Fraser said. “If you go into the back room, there’s no signal. The only way you can get there is through two shorter flights.” A mesh system also helps your device automatically connect to the strongest station as you move about the house. When you’re in the living room, your smartphone will automatically pull a signal from the station there. With a traditional Wi-Fi router, your signal would degrade the farther you move from the base station. You could boost a Wi-Fi router’s connection with an extender station. But you would have to manually connect your device to the extender’s Wi-Fi network, and when you moved away from the extender, you would have to manually switch back to the main router’s Wi-Fi network. Finally, mesh systems like Eero, which looks like a sleek white hub with rounded corners, and Google Wifi, which is a white cylindrically shaped device, aren’t eyesores. So you need not be shy about putting the Wi-Fi hubs out in the open, like on a side table, for a clear line of sight with your gadgets. It isn’t perfect The main downside is that you lose some speed with every so-called hop. Let’s say that your primary Wi-Fi station is in the living room, you have a satellite hub in the basement, and in between those two rooms there is another satellite hub in the garage. In the basement, your speeds will be slower, because the primary router makes a copy of the data as it hops to the satellite in the garage, and then the satellite in the garage produces another copy that reaches the satellite in the basement. Despite the sluggishness, that is still better than getting a crummy signal or no connection at all. Netgear’s Orbi works differently than traditional mesh systems. It has a dedicated Wi-Fi band, or connection, in which only the router and satellites can talk to each other; no other devices can interfere with their connection. Hence Orbi’s hubs can transfer data more quickly. The other downside of a mesh system is they are not cheap. A pack of three Eero devices costs about $400, Google Wifi costs about $300 for a pack of three, and Netgear’s Orbi with a router and one wall-plug satellite costs $300. Google says the rule of thumb for choosing a package is that each access point covers about 1,500 square feet of space. But configurations will vary depending on the layout of your home and the materials inside your walls.

According to a report from Fortune, the tech companies were victims of a sophisticated $100 million phishing attack, in which the employees of both were tricked into sending money to overseas bank accounts. geralt / Pixabay How Google and Facebook were tricked Last month when the Justice Department announced the arrest of a man who allegedly swindled more than $100 million from the two tech companies, information about the scam was pretty much kept quiet. The Justice Department did not reveal who was robbed or identify the Asian supplier the suspect impersonated to get the money, notes Fortune. An investigation by Fortune involving an interview with sources close to law enforcement and others has unveiled the names of three companies and a few other details of the fraud case. The investigation disclosed that the two firms that were allegedly sent fraudulent invoices were actually Google and Facebook. And the two U.S. tech giants were allegedly tricked by a Lithuanian: Evaldas Rimasauskas. Rimasauskas was accused of moving funds which were intended for the supplier Quanta to different bank accounts in places like Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, Hong Kong and Latvia. The 48-year old suspect was charged with money laundering, wire fraud and identity theft for impersonating Quanta Computer, a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer that boasts of clients like Apple, Facebook and Google. In a statement to CNBC, Facebook said, “We recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.” Google said it detected this scam against its vendor management team and quickly alerted the authorities. “We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved,” the company said. Phishing scams getting more complex than ever This fraud case has shown that no company is immune to scams, and even the largest companies can be victimized by scams involving fake suppliers and email phishing. In December, the National Audit Office warned that the U.K. is not completely prepared for online fraud, and it cost customers in the U.K. at least £14.8 billion last year. Around £4.2 billion of the £14.8 billion is believed to be unreported and hidden losses from crime like counterfeit goods and mass marketing fraud, notes The Guardian. Commenting on the phishing threat facing large companies, James Maude at cyber-security firm Avecto told the BBC that sometimes the staff at big companies think that they are safe and that security is not part of their job. “But people are part of the best security you can have – that’s why you have to train them,” the expert said. Maude told the BBC that they have come across phishing attempts in which hacked email accounts of senior staff are used to convince others in the company to transfer money. To avoid such scams going forward, big firms are being advised to verify new payment requests carefully before authorizing them.

Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store, has long been sandwiched between Google's advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. Not any more. The business, categorized as "Other Revenue" in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday – a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. "(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "We think that is quite an impressive achievement." Alphabet does not break out revenue contribution within the "Other Revenue" segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category's clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google's cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's Azure. But Google is investing heavily. "In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. "We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017," Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. "People are hankering for a really awesome Android phone that basically gives them the iPhone experience," Wang said, adding that the growth in Google's "other revenue" bucket this quarter "shows sustained momentum for the Pixel." Still, the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue comes from ads and that's not going to change any time soon. Total advertising revenue increased 18.8 percent to $21.1 billion in the first quarter, the company reported on Thursday. Profit also rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, beating Wall Street estimates. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Alphabet's drive for diversification also includes its "Other Bets" business, considered the company's loss-making arm. The business, home to the Waymo self-driving car, Google Fiber and thermostat-maker Nest, posted a first-quarter loss of $855 million. Google's shares were up 4.6 percent at a record high of $932.73 on Friday morning. They have gained 12.5 percent this year up to Thursday's close.

Reuters 2 The Apple product could rival the Amazon Echo, a voice-controlled virtual assistant 2 Leakster Sonny Dickson said an Apple insider claimed the new device will look ‘fat’ like Google Home In September 2016, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on a smart home device which would ship with facial recognition cameras. And now Sonny Dickson, who is famed for leaking gadgets and gizmos while they are still in development, said Apple is currently finalising designs for their Echo competitor. “It’s expected to be marketed as a Siri or AirPlay device,” he said. It’s likely to be in the style of the Mac Pro and have boom mesh around the speakers. Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 MOST READ IN TECH AND SCIENCE CHILLING CHALLENGE The Blue Whale 'suicide game' has been linked to hundreds of teen deaths - now it's reached British shores KODI-FIANT Makers of Kodi say they will NEVER stop Brits from accessing films using telly boxes TURN THEM ON Race to create best sex robot that's 'better in the sack' than a human SNAP DECISION Snapchat issues update to make your 'Memories' a little bit prettier GO GO GADGET The Samsung Galaxy S8 is available TODAY - here's the lowdown on the exciting launch NO ONE WILL HEAR YOU SCREAM Alien director Ridley Scott says aliens will visit Earth one day... and wipe out humanity iPHONE 8 RUMOURS The new Apple iPhone 8 could released in MONTHS - here's the lowdown on the exciting new device RAW POWER Xbox Project Scorpio looks set to rival the PS4 Pro and Nintendo's Switch 'REST IN PEACE' Dad dies during Twitch live stream of 24 hour charity gaming marathon TOO HOT TO HANDLE Samsung drops HUGE hint about plans for Samsung Note 8 launch later this year - but will it catch fire?

X Google and Facebook scammed out of €92m Major tech companies admit they were the victims of a phishing attack about 14 hours ago Google’s Dublin offices on Barrow Street. File photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Irish Times         Google and Facebook were phished for more than $100 million (about €92 million), it has been reported, in a case which proves that not even the biggest technology companies in the world are immune from the increasingly sophisticated attacks of online scammers. Last month, it was reported that two major tech companies were tricked by a Lithuanian man into sending him more than $100 million. The man, Evaldas Rimasauskas (48), was charged with wire fraud, money-laundering and aggravated identity theft for impersonating Quanta Computer - a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that includes Google, Facebook and Apple as clients. Now an investigation by Fortune has shown that the two firms Rimasauskas reportedly sent fraudulent invoices to were Facebook and Google, who paid out more than $100 million. Facebook said in a statement: “We recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and have been co-operating with law enforcement in its investigation.” HQTralee awarded two years’ free gigabit fibre broadband Cybercrime a reality and one that is hurting Irish firms Jeff Bezos just $5bn away from being world’s richest person Likewise, Google said it had “detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. “We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved.” Phishing attacks The case shows just how big an issue phishing and online fraud has become, with phishing attacks conning people and companies across the world out of significant sums of money. While the age-old Nigerian prince scams still operate by offering bogus sums of money, techniques used by thieves have become increasingly sophisticated. The UK’s National Audit Office warned in December that online fraud cost UK consumers at least £14.8 billion (about €17.5 billion) last year. From costly conveyancing scams to fake IT support, it’s more important than ever to double-check anything that asks for personal details or money. But when not even Facebook and Google get tricked, it paints a grim picture for your average user.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter Shares of Alphabet Inc. were up 5% midday Friday, a day after the company beat first-quarter earnings expectations, and as many Wall Street analysts followed by raising price targets. Google sites led Alphabet Inc.’s earnings as the primary driver of revenue and many analysts see greater revenue growth ahead, coming from added advertising streams as well as Google’s YouTube site. But there is concern that Google’s traffic acquisition costs (TAC) as a percentage of revenue will continue to increase. Shares of Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71%  have gained 10.4% in the past three months, compared with the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.19%   gain of 3.9%. See also: Google survives YouTube ad controversy for now The average stock price target of the 46 analysts surveyed by FactSet increased to $1,031.36 on Friday, or about 9.4% above current levels, from an average of $982.26 before earnings were released. Here’s what analysts said: • Despite the earnings beat, Wedbush analysts are concerned about growing pressure from the sites’ traffic-acquisition costs. Alphabet’s TAC as a percentage of sites revenue increased this quarter, the analysts said, and in the future management said it expects the overall percentage to continue to grow. Wedbush analysts raised their price target to $725, based on the earnings beat, but reiterated an underperform rating on the stock saying, “We see underappreciated risks to search advertising as substantial enough to support our rating.” • Pacific Crest analysts had a cheerier view of Alphabet’s revenue opportunities, saying there are further growth opportunities with YouTube TV as well as with Google Cloud. Those two segments look to be beating non-search revenue at Google in terms of growth, they said. The analysts raised their price target to $1,100 from $1,040 and reiterated an outperform rating. • Susquehanna analysts see coming ad catalysts with device-specific bidding, advertising in Google’s local maps and the addition of a fourth advertisement at the top of its search page. Management’s tighter expense control as well as more share allocations should also improve sentiment around the stock. The analysts increased their price target to $1,200 from $1,000 and maintained a positive rating on the stock. • Alphabet’s tighter expense control, as evidenced by stable Google segment operating margins, should help soothe investor fears of greater investments later on, said UBS analysts. The analysts raised their price target to $1,050 from $950 and reiterated a buy rating. • RBC Capital Markets analysts said Alphabet’s earnings beat showed “more evidence of the sustainable fruit” of having an efficient management team and organizational structure. Alphabet highlighted mobile growth, with 44% year-over-year growth in paid clicks. “Alphabet just printed its 29th straight quarter of 20%ish organic revenue growth. We believe this is unprecedented, especially for an asset of this size,” said Mark Mahaney, lead analyst on the report. RBC analysts raised their price target to $1,050 from $1,025 and reiterated an outperform rating. • One other negative hanging over Alphabet has been controversy with advertisements appearing alongside controversial videos on YouTube. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt, said he believes the issue has blown over and that management, including Chief Executive Sundar Pichai’s comments on the earnings call, have adequately addressed it. “We believe those concerns are alleviated at this point, with clear focus and interest evident that addressing content issues is a top priority,” Cakmak wrote. He raised his price target to $1,050 from $900 and reiterated a buy rating, saying he believes Alphabet is the “most favorable risk-reward tradeoff in large cap tech.” More from MarketWatch Star Cars of the Shanghai Auto Show 2017 Trump Approval Rating Slides You May Live to 100; Are You Prepared?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Apr 29, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Uber’s self-driving vehicle head steps aside amid lawsuit AP, SAN FRANCISCO The executive running Uber Technologies Inc’s self-driving car division is stepping aside while the company defends itself against charges that he provided the project with technology stolen from a Google spinoff. Anthony Levandowski, an autonomous vehicle expert who defected from Google last year, on Thursday notified Uber’s staff of his decision in an e-mail. The change was made in tandem with Uber chief executive officer Travis Kalanick, the e-mail said. Although Levandowski will remain at Uber, he will not be overseeing the autonomous-car project while the ride-hailing service is locked in a legal showdown with Waymo, a rival started by Google eight years ago. Instead of reporting directly to Kalanick, Levandowski will now be under the supervision of a former subordinate, Eric Meyhofer, appointed to replace him during the Waymo battle. Waymo in February filed a lawsuit accusing Levandowski of illegally downloading its blueprints for a navigation technology known as lidar before founding a start-up that he later sold to Uber for US$680 million. That deal brought to Uber most of the employees now working in its Advanced Technologies Group that is building self-driving cars. Waymo is seeking a court order that would force Uber to stop its work on autonomous vehicles on the grounds that the project has been drawing on trade secrets taken by Levandowski before he left Google. Uber has denied its self-driving cars are using Waymo’s technology. A hearing on Waymo’s request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for Wednesday. If a federal judge sides with Waymo, it could hobble Uber’s efforts to catch up in the still-developing field of autonomous cars. Such vehicles could revolutionize transportation, including the rapidly growing ride-hailing industry. In his e-mail, Levandowski told employees to keep him out of any discussions about Uber’s work on its lidar system while reminding them that all of the company’s self-driving car technology “has been built independently, from the ground up.” “[By recusing myself,] I hope to keep the team focused on achieving the vision that brought us all here,” he said.

The US Department of Justice last month announced details of a $100 million "fraudulent email compromise scheme" against two unnamed "multinational internet companies." Now, thanks to Fortune, we know the identity of those companies: Facebook and Google. Fortune on Thursday, citing an unnamed person familiar with the investigation, reported that Facebook approached the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan asking for help recovering the millions it lost in the scheme. Facebook in a statement confirmed it was one of the fraud victims. "Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation," a company spokesperson told PCMag. Google also this week confirmed it was a victim. "We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities," a Google spokesperson told Fortune. "We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." Google did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. The new revelations come after the Justice Department last month announced the arrest of a Lithuanian man named Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, who is charged with orchestrating an email scheme that tricked two "US-based internet companies" to wire more than $100 million to bank accounts he controlled. Related How to Recognize and Avoid Phishing Emails and Links How to Recognize and Avoid Phishing Emails and Links According to the indictment, Rimasauskas carried out the scheme from at least 2013 through 2015. The fraudster allegedly registered and incorporated a company in Latvia that "bore the same name as an Asian-based computer hardware manufacturer" with whom the US tech giants did business. He then spoofed emails to look like they were coming from the Asian supplier — identified last month as Taiwan's Quinta Computer — directing the US tech giants to make payments into his own bank accounts. Over the course of the scheme, he successfully tricked the victim companies into transferring more than $100 million into his own accounts. In other words, even tech giants like Facebook and Google fall for email scams. "This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies — even the most sophisticated — that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals," Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said in a statement last month.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Even the World's Largest Internet Companies Get Phished, Just Like Your Grandma Libby WatsonYesterday 12:12pm Filed to: Whoops Facebook Google Phishing 7 6 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Getty. If you’ve ever been duped by a phishing scam, you can feel a little less stupid about it today, because you’ve been joined in that sad club by Google and Facebook. Advertisement Phishing attacks, where scammers pose as a trusted company or person via email and trick people into—for example—clicking a link, signing into a fake website, or even handing over their bank details, are a huge problem. And it works surprisingly often, particularly on older people (and senior members of Hillary Clinton’s campaign staff). But it seems even the world’s largest internet companies—organizations that have shaped the internet itself—are not immune from such attacks. A few weeks ago, the Justice Department announced that it had arrested a Lithuanian man in connection with a phishing attack that scammed two unnamed US tech companies out of a total of $100 million. Now, an investigation by Fortune has revealed that those two companies are Facebook and Google. Advertisement The scam was pretty sophisticated. Between 2013 and 2015, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly posed as a Taiwanese parts manufacturer named Quanta—which both companies do business with—through his own company with the same name registered in Latvia. He created fake email addresses and invoices for computer supplies, convincing the companies to make transfers totaling $100 million, which he then wired to bank accounts around the world. Rimasauskas denies the charge. Both Facebook and Google confirmed that they had been victims of the scam. In an email to Gizmodo, a Facebook spokesperson wrote: Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation. We are confident that we have the proper controls in place to prevent such attacks in the future. The spokesperson didn’t respond to our query about whether the company had implemented any new measures to stop a similar incident from happening again. Meanwhile, a Google spokesperson told Fortune, “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved.” Sponsored An important twist reported by Fortune? Google and Facebook didn’t disclose this event to shareholders, which may mean they ran afoul of rules requiring them to disclose “material events.” Fortune’s sources close to the companies “suggested they had decided the Rimasauskas fraud was not material enough to require disclosure of it.” $100 million over two years sounds reasonably material to us, but what do we know? Whether or not these companies misled their shareholders, one thing is sure: no one, whether it’s your grandma who sent over her bank details to someone from BankofAmercia dot yahoo dot com or one of the richest companies in the world, is safe from phishing.

Microsoft has a lot to answer for in the world of cheap laptops. I’m not convinced Windows 10, as it stands, is fit for the realities of budget netbooks. The likes of Google’s basic but ever-improving Chrome OS and the wonderful (and free) world of Linux are looking ever more attractive and, so far, Microsoft hasn’t come up with an answer. Both these operating systems are just about fit for a dual-core, bottom-of-the-range Intel Celeron, but I don’t think the same can be said of Windows. Windows 10 Cloud, which has been making its way through the rumour mill for several months, seems like Microsoft’s best chance of not losing out completely in an area in which it really needs to be present. The most recent news points to specs advice on so-called 'Cloudbooks', asking for quick boot times, Intel Celeron processors, and 4GB of memory. Related: Best laptops for students But it’s about more than just hardware. The success of these machines depends what form the operating system takes, and recently, there have been two vital decisions from Microsoft that could determine whether Windows is what budget laptop buyers are looking for. First, Microsoft has done a huge amount of work in improving the much-maligned 'Modern' apps of Windows 8, and having launched the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) for developers, there's progress being made in lightweight apps that can be kept in check in terms of security and permissions. Second, Microsoft has committed itself to being compatible with ARM-based processors as well as x86-based chips, which are currently the norm. This opens the door to laptops powered by cheaper, more power-efficient chips that run on hardware designed by ARM. Intel, by far the biggest player in the world of computer chips, has said it will also start working on chips that are based on ARM designs. Microsoft is even creating an x86 emulator that can run applications on ARM processors. Related: Best browser These two crucial developments open the door to my ideal vision of Windows 10 Cloud: essentially a lightweight OS with UWP apps and nothing else. Incorporate the Edge web browser, Office365 applications (for a subscription), and get enough big players such as Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon on board and you have a very attractive Chromebook alternative. With only UWP apps allowed, and their permissions and performance strictly limited, Microsoft should be able to dial down all those background processes that bog down ultra-cheap laptops running full-fat Windows 10. Oh, and it needs to be much cheaper to licence. A chunk of the cost of any new Windows laptop is the price of Windows itself. Ditch a bit of that with the knowledge that you’ll see more units, and I think it’s a genuinely great idea. Related: Acer Chromebook 14 review This all sounds simple, and you won’t be surprised to hear this isn’t an original idea. In fact, Microsoft has already done this in some form twice in recent years – first in 2012 with the ARM-compatible Windows RT. Horrible name, bad execution. The market wasn’t ready for it and only a handful of devices ever launched. Second with Windows 10 Continuum – Microsoft literally built Windows 10 into its Lumia handsets, as did HP, but it was slow and, more importantly, nobody seemed to care. It’s all gone very quiet since. This is Microsoft’s best chance to catch up with Google Chromebooks, and I hope it delivers at its event scheduled for May 2. Can Microsoft catch up to Google's Chomebooks?

I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police! Conclusion Wow, this post was long. If you have any questions about the hardware or software in this list, feel free to ask me in the comments below.

It looks fantastic :) Corbin Davenport Gladly! http://www.ebay.com/itm/First-Order-Trooper-vinyl-decal-sticker-STAR-WARS-Force-Awakens-/171760424579 EcE Any particular reason your smartwatches stopped working? I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers.

Now anyone can create a Google Classroom Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/27 6:45am PDTApr 27, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares280 Applications Downloads News Last month it was announced that Google Classroom would be opened up to anyone with a Google account — the collaboration tool for education was limited to those with a G Suite account, previously. That change meant that normal users could join classrooms, but now Google is expanding the functionality and allowing anyone to create and manage classrooms, too. According to Google's blog, The Keyword, teachers and students have been testing this new feature for the past few weeks. Google points to 3 specific use cases in its post. The first is an adult course on graphic design using Google Drawings (a good opportunity for cross-promotion there). The second involves after school programs, in this instance a girl scout group dedicated to building robots. And lastly, it talks about a student-run club intended to bring together those wanting to discuss design, art, and programming. It looks like it would be perfect for various adult education programs not affiliated with a school and it's great to see Google making these types of educational resources available to more and more people.

Grey Hopefully this means more things will be coming to all users from G-Suite. I'm talking about the new Hangouts. Plain Hangouts both badly needs modern features and is only modern features away from being recommendable to everyone. Plus instead of simply playing catch-up it adds new and interesting features and connectivity to other Google apps - plus a sweet video call meeting feature that everyone could take advantage of. It's a no brainer. I hope they announce it next month. Drakenoid That is genius!! Google should make enterprise features and release them to everyone else! People like their gsuite apps as it is! Derik Taylor This could be interesting. I have been considering getting with a group of people for study days for various topics, but have no idea how Google Classroom works. Interested to try it out. NunjaBusiness "or take a look online, to see if there's anything interesting you'd like to learn." Umm, yeah, the first thing I'd like to learn is how to find a list of classes available. You didn't seem to manage to do that in your little write-up. Fargo_Zoidberg Angry! Scott Scrivens Good point, it doesn't work like that. You need a classroom code to join a specific one.There is no list. I've updated the article accordingly. Midnitte Seems like it could be useful for MOOCs Pedro Majano I think this kind of topic does not belong to an android blog... unless all of your target audience has GSuite for Education and are Teachers and Admin console users... Just saying. But lets see the comments. Zouz Dude, it's available to anyone with a simple Gmail account, did you read the article ? Pedro Majano LOL marcusmarcus2 Also, the article has a link to the playstore for the android app for this. So yeah, completely reasonable to be in an Android blog. Pedro Majano I could swear i saw "Not" instead of "Now", but I got coffee now, sorry bout that! 4Ui812 Now anyone can show Google how to properly check for software bugs prior to release. Atleast that's how I read the headline :-) Lee I've been wishing for a long time to use this system for teaching Japanese online. I'm curious to see if I can truly use this tool for tutoring. Grant Phillips-Sewell Works for Gmail accounts. Weeks due GSuite for Education accounts. Does not seem to work with other types of GSuite admits. *sadface* instinct As a teacher, I love Google Classroom. I don't think too many users who are not teachers will want to use it, but I bet there are some user case scenarios that it would be useful for. Sergio Schickler Inaccurate article. Just tried to signup with my GSuite Work (personal, US based) and it clearly states it is only available for GSuite for Education.

The big players are Microsoft Teams, Google G Suite, and Slack. Slack offers a free option that can be used by anyone to create a team channel and use it for collaboration. They also offer an entry level subscription at $6.67 per user, if you bill it annually, and that lifts many of the limitations of their free tier. Microsoft Teams is integrated with Office 365 and is only available to commercial subscribers of the service so that means no free option. Google G Suite is also a subscription based service that starts out at $5 per user, per month however, they do not offer any free version of their product. All of them have a variety of services that can be integrated into their offerings and I suspect that most subscribers will adopt the team collaboration option that is part of their existing subscriptions. That means Google users to G Suite and Office 365 subscribers to Microsoft Teams. Of course, Slack's free model likely helps drive small to medium sized companies to upgrade to a paid subscription to remove limitations that are part of the free tier. Now we have to consider what role Facebook's Workplace will now play in this key marketplace. During the social media companies recent F8 developers conference they announced several enhancements to Workplace one of which will now include integration with Microsoft's Office suite including OneDrive cloud storage. In addition to the Office integration, they will also offer a free tier like Slack does to entice organizations to try out their offering and hopefully get hooked. That in turn could result in upgrades to their subscription options but the premium offering will expire on 30 September and then users will have to convert to a subscription. There is a free standard offering that does not expire which provides a subset of the services features for companies who can work within the limits of what is available for free. That is the other spot that Workplace could be very competitive against its rivals in this space. Subscriptions for the first 1,000 people costs $3 each, $2 per user for the next 9,000 seats, and then $1 per person after that level has been reached. Since Microsoft Teams is integrated with Office 365 there is no way I can see for them to offer a free trial/level of access but Google could feasibly offer a subset of its own G Suite's features to let users try out the service. More to be seen here for sure so check out the gallery to see what Facebook Workplace looks like on mobile and desktop devices. ---------- But, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+. ---------------------------------- Looking for an awesome, no-nonsense technical conference for IT Pros, Devs, and Devops?

TECHNOLOGY Google Assistant Is Open Now So Google Can Be Everywhere Google launched its Assistant SDK, meaning the AI software can be embedded in hardware and interact through voice from any device. By Alex Moazed Alex Moazed is the CEO of Applico, which he founded with credit cards in college. He advises companies like Google and those in Highland Capital's portfolio on platform innovation and has developed more than 300 apps. @AlexMoazed Founder and CEO, Applico@AlexMoazed WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Earlier today, Google unveiled the Assistant SDK (software development kit), which means developers and engineers can integrate the voice-enabled AI into virtually any hardware of their choosing. Watch the announcement video here: After teasing this release last year with its launch of the Pixel smartphone, Google Assistant is officially a developer platform. Whereas Assistant could only help users with vocal commands related to Google properties, such as Search or Photos, it can now accept and execute custom commands programmed by developers. As an example, Google posted another video with the announcement, showing how Assistant can be used to control a DIY home bar for mixing mocktails (or cocktails for the adults). A user could feasibly order a Tom Collins to relax in the summer heat once a clever developer codes out the recipe and protocols necessary to automate the pouring. An Open Sandbox While automated beverage-pouring makes for a fun application, Assistant's opening speaks to much greater potential. The Internet of Things (IoT) will become decidedly more exciting and accessible. Google recently announced that the AI could distinguish between up to six unique voices, each with its own relevant user data, such as location, nickname, payment info, Netflix and Spotify accounts. Developers could create settings wherein specific users get specific results, to the effect of pulling pranks or customizing outcomes (like Assistant knowing your favorite drink by mechanical heart). With enough tinkering on Google's part, Assistant will likely find a home in the Waymo division and use the open experimentation as a guide for how to maximize voice's potential couched in self-driving. Waymo recently started letting the public test its vehicles in Phoenix, AZ, so it won't be surprising if the division announced voice integration by the end of the year. No Need for an Inside Voice Similar to the opportunity Amazon Lex's open environment provides, Google Assistant could be applied to more than homemade or consumer devices; it could become an engine for innovation in IoT and manufacturing. Google has already enabled developers to connect their hardware and devices by way of Android Things, which the company expects will empower developers to leverage the rich Android ecosystem and will ideally universalize the IoT environment under its little green robot banner. It's unclear how compatible Android Things and Assistant are at the moment, but it should be expected that Google will start building linkages between the two systems, which would allow users to command a device through another. Put simply, a person could verbally "hit" the snooze button on the alarm clock and order the coffee maker to start brewing a pot while that person catches a few more minutes of sleep, all from the comfort of one's bed. That's merely a drop of convenience made viable by a verbally connected IoT ecosystem. As well, Google Assistant could deployed to larger hardware - think assembly line machinery. The automated factories of tomorrow could be operated purely by voice, in person or even through a smartphone. The connected factory could operate at a more efficient level, requiring fewer degrees of commands to perform functions. Instead of a line manager yelling for a halt to production and relying on a technician hearing the order and reacting quickly enough to perform the mechanical steps necessary, that line manager could simply call for the stoppage and receive it faster than ever before. Over time, developers could create more and more custom commands and solutions to suit specific industries and factories, yielding more productive outcomes for manufacturers and generating a new platform for industrial apps. How Google Benefits For every device that uses Google Assistant, the search giant learns how people interact with devices by voice and can better train its AI to operate more effectively and personally for the users. A better voice AI means more people will be drawn to use Assistant, leveraging network effects, and Google can start building new AI products centered around voice and, potentially, new data inputs. As well, Google could find new opportunities for monetization through Assistant, using recommendations to drive ad delivery and consumption and possibly app or e-commerce purchases. Enterprising developers should seize this opportunity to integrate Google Assistant with their hardware and devices ideas. First movers will have an opportunity to define the space in tandem with Google and will probably be able to negotiate lucrative terms before the company has a chance to sort out how it can fully control the new environment.

The fact that the tech giants were swindled by a man impersonating as an Asian supplier of tech equipments, who was arrested last month for the crime, came to light during Fortune’s interviews with the law enforcement, as was revealed in its findings. Evaldas Rimasauskas, the accused, allegedly designed an elaborate scheme to defraud tech companies in 2013. To do so, according to the Justice Department, he forged documents, email addresses and corporate digital signatures to create an impersonation of a large Asian manufacturer with whom the companies regularly did business. He then tricked the companies into making payments for computer supplies they never ordered. From 2013-2015, Rimasauskas allegedly managed to convince the finance and accounts departments of both Facebook and Google to make large transfers in lieu of payments. Before the companies caught on to what was happening, they had already transferred around $100 million. He then stashed the money in multiple banks across Eastern Europe. He was finally arrested for the scam last year and charges of wire fraud were pressed against him. According to a press release issued by the United States Attorney’s office, southern district of New York on March 21, most of money has already been recovered. The authorities are still pursuing the extradition of Rimasauskas, who has denied the charges. “Mr. Rimasauskas cannot expect a fair and impartial trial in the USA. The uncertainty is further increased taking into account the behavior of FBI agents during the interrogations of Mr. Rimašaukas, frightening him with long years in US prisons, and the transfer of computers to US law enforcement officials, which was made without the presence of the owner,” his lawyer, Linas Kuprusevičius, told Fortune in an email. Rimasauskas also claimed that the Justice Department and Lithuanian authorities not naming the companies was infringing on his right to a fair trial. He is still in custody in Lithuania, according to a spokesperson of the U.S. Attorney’s office in New York. How the company’s names were revealed is also interesting. Quanta Computer, a major supplier of computer and electronic parts, conceded in March that it was actually the supplier that Rimasauskas allegedly impersonated. After repeated interviews with law enforcement officials, Fortune contacted Facebook, which responded in an email, saying: “Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation." Google also responded saying: “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved," said a Google spokesperson.” The scam involved email phishing and impersonation and has raised questions as to why the companies have been silent about the issue. Their silence is peculiar, since both companies owe an obligation to tell investors what happened. The scam is interesting in its simplicity — there was no hacking, no insiders and no other complicated techniques involved. The fact is that many consumers use these companies’ applications and share valuable data with them. If they can be so easily scammed, it raises questions about how consumers could remain safe from such scams.

Not any more. The business, categorized as "Other Revenue" in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday – a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. "(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "We think that is quite an impressive achievement." Alphabet does not break out revenue contribution within the "Other Revenue" segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category's clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google's cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's Azure. But Google is investing heavily. "In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. "We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017," Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. "People are hankering for a really awesome Android phone that basically gives them the iPhone experience," Wang said, adding that the growth in Google's "other revenue" bucket this quarter "shows sustained momentum for the Pixel." Still, the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue comes from ads and that's not going to change any time soon. Total advertising revenue increased 18.8 percent to $21.1 billion in the first quarter, the company reported on Thursday. Profit also rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, beating Wall Street estimates. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Alphabet's drive for diversification also includes its "Other Bets" business, considered the company's loss-making arm. The business, home to the Waymo self-driving car, Google Fiber and thermostat-maker Nest, posted a first-quarter loss of $855 million. Google's shares were up 4.6 percent at a record high of $932.73 on Friday morning. They have gained 12.5 percent this year up to Thursday's close.

Nowadays all it takes is a few minutes to find information on pretty much anything you can think off. You can find recipes, learn a new skill or catch up on your favorite series without leaving the comfort of your home. Even though most of us uses Google religiously we are only used to the basic way of finding information. Here are ways to help you quickly find information on Google. 1. Search by time period. We may need to urgently look for information about an event that happened at a specific time. It is very easy to do so, you just need to add the year range separated by three dots. For instance, if we want to find out the players who have featured for the Ghana national football team, we will insert:   2. Search full phrases. Simply insert your search term in a quotation mark to find something in a specific manner you would like. For example, if we search the words we face neither east nor west without quotation marks, the search engine will show the results where these words appear in any order on a website, as opposed to the specific order in which you typed them. If we search “we face neither east nor west” with quotation marks, you’ll get only the results where these words appear only in the right order you typed them in. This is a great way to find the lyrics to a song when you only know one line from it.   3. Search a specific website. When you need to find an interesting article on a particular website but do not want to skim through the entire page or maybe the site’s internal search function isn’t given you want you just do this. Type the address of the website followed by the keyword or phrase you are after like:   4. Search for a title and url If you want to find an article with a key term included in the title, simply type “intitle: ” without spaces followed by the key term. If you want to find a url with the key term use: “inurl:”.   5. Search similar websites. If you want to find similar or relatable websites, type in “related:” without spaces followed by the url of the site like:   6. Search for A or B. Maybe you don’t quite remember a name but you need for information about the said person. Simply use “or”. For example:   7. Search and remove unimportant results. If you are looking for a movie title but are not interested in purchasing the book, you can omit all websites that sell the DVD or digital downloads. You remove unimportant searches by adding the “-” to your key terms. For example, if you want to find a site about interesting Ghanaian cookbooks, but you aren’t looking to buy them, you can write the following: ICYM: Here’s The Stunning Google Doodle That Celebrated 98 Year Old Esther Afua Ocloo and 8 Simple Tricks To Speed Up The Internet On Your Phone. 0 I like this post SHARE TWEET EMAIL Comments Related Stories 8 Ways To Stay Safe When Boarding A Vehicle At Kwame Nkrumah Circle 7 Life Changing Ways To Search Google For Information You Are Probably Not Doing 20 Ghanaians Reveal What They Did To Get The Worst Beating As A Kid 17 Things People Will Do If They Meet That Wicked Senior From Secondary School The 16 Dumbest Things About Life In Ghana 10 Ghanaian Female Celebrities Who Make Short Hair Look Sweet 9 Everyday Habits Of Super Successful Ghanaians 8 Great Other Ways You Can Use Your Kitchen Sponge Latest Stories This Is Ridiculous, Metro Mass Worker Sacked For Failing To Account For GHc1.50p By Quaci Kyei on April 28th 2017 News    1 8 Ways To Stay Safe When Boarding A Vehicle At Kwame Nkrumah Circle By Quaci Kyei on April 28th 2017 Lifestyle    1 20 Ghanaians Reveal What They Did To Get The Worst Beating As A Kid By Kwaku Darko on April 28th 2017 Lifestyle    4 All The Beautiful Moments Shatta Wale Looked Too Innocent To Be A Bad Boy By Quaci Kyei on April 28th 2017 News    2 OMG!

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 28, 2017 11:56am   Comments Share: Related AMZN Consulting The Crystal Ball To See How Apple May Reduce Its iPhone Dependence A Quick Take On Big Tech's Q1 Results Stock ETFs Struggle On Weak GDP Data But These 2 Sectors Bounce Back (Investor's Business Daily) Related GOOGL A Quick Take On Big Tech's Q1 Results Earnings Strength Keeps Driving Market Despite Concerns About GDP, Geopolitics Stock ETFs Struggle On Weak GDP Data But These 2 Sectors Bounce Back (Investor's Business Daily) Despite all doomsday predictions for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) following the YouTube advertiser pullback controversy, the company turned in strong quarterly results. Impressive Ad Strength UBS analyst Eric Sheridan sees across-the-board strength in Google's first-quarter results, with core advertising business growing at 19 percent year-over-year, despite at a scale of $21.4 billion, driven by programmatic, Search and YouTube. The analyst said Google's emerging growth areas such as AI/machine, learning, enterprise/cloud, media consumption, tech hardware, local advertising, self-driving vehicles and life sciences, which are still under-appreciated by most investors, also showed strength. Sheridan also noted a disciplined approach to allocating capital as evidenced by lower "other bets" losses, better core operating margins and a strong balance sheet. Positives/Negatives UBS views the following as positives: Stronger-than-expected FX-neutral websites revenue growth of 23 percent versus its estimate of 20 growth, driven by continued momentum in mobile Search and YouTube. Higher than expected network revenues on the back of strong growth in programmatic and AdMob. Google "other" revenues came in above expectation, driven by strength in Play, hardware and Cloud. Stable Google segment GAAP operating margins against investor fear of forward investment curve. Enhanced geographic revenue disclosure. The negatives outlined by UBS are as follows: Distribution and network TAC continue to uptick sequentially, given mobile and programmatic mix shifts. Lower-than-expected repurchases. Higher-than-expected effective tax rate despite lapping one-time discrete items in Q4. Salmon's Take On Search, YouTube And Cloud BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon offered his view on the different businesses of Google. Search: The analyst believes the most important issue for the stock near term remains the impact of the high-margin fourth mobile ad unit and the pace of rollout for promoted places on Maps. The analyst believes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)'s rise will be a slight headwind, but reiterated there are lots of verticals with little overlap. YouTube: The analyst believes the YouTube protests will have limited near-term financial impact, although he thinks they will slightly weaken negotiating leverage for upfront commitments. Cloud: "Cloud growth remains strong and we believe results were favorably impacted by good demand for Google Home," the analyst said. The analyst expects strong Google "other" growth in the second and third quarter but some moderation in the fourth quarter, as it laps the year-ago quarter's 62 percent growth. Estimate Changes UBS raised its second-quarter net revenue estimate to $20.84 billion from $20.54 billion and GAAP EBITDA estimate to $8.63 billion from $8.42 billion but maintained its GAAP earnings per share estimate at $8.28. The firm also raised its 2017 net revenue estimate to $87.45 billion from $86.13 billion and GAAP EBITDA estimate to $35.30 billion from $34.86 billion but lowered its GAAP earnings per share estimate to $33.85 from $34.26. Rating/Price Target UBS reiterated its Buy rating on the shares of the company, while it lifted its price target to $1,050 from $980. "We continue to recommend Alphabet as a key holding in US Internet," UBS said. Meanwhile, BMO Capital Market continues to see solid revenue trends driven by key ad load growth initiatives such as fourth search unit and promoted places on Maps, TV budgets' shifting to YouTube and the continued emergence of non-advertising revenues like Cloud, which management reiterated as a top investment priority. "This should underpin a 'grind it out' story, but we continue to see more upside in AMZN," the firm said. BMO Capital Markets continues to rate Google a Market Perform, but raised its price target to $970. At the time of writing, Google shares were up 4.86 percent at $934.72.

Nintendo Switch A single hub is $179, but multiple units are needed to best leverage the benefit of mesh Wi-Fi. Besides providing Wi-Fi coverage in hard-to-reach areas through multiple units, Network Assist software “will seamlessly transition your device between the Google Wifi system points in real-time, to help you avoid dead spots and delays.” Other software features like Wi-Fi pause can halt the connection at scheduled times to certain devices and is especially geared towards managing kids’ internet usage. With a simple Android or iOS app, users can also prioritize certain devices for uninterrupted streaming. Earlier in the month, some Wifi units suffered from connectivity issues, though Google is actively working on a fix and notes that only a small number of users are encountering the issue. Google Wifi is available starting today with a 1-pack for $179 and a 3-pack for $439 from the Google Store. Physical stores include Best Buy Canada, Staples Canada, and Walmart Canada, with more retailers coming soon. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

At his old gig, Foster led development on the Kindle tablet lineup, as well as the Amazon Echo. While a company losing an executive suddenly may seem odd, especially with a potential Pixel 2 coming up and Google I/O right around the corner, Bloomberg reports that Google is not planning to replace Foster. I suppose if the role of VP of Hardware Product Development was essential, Google could insert someone rather quickly, but they aren’t. It’s possible Osterloh will oversee it all moving forward, but details are limited on the inner workings of Google’s hardware division. Best of luck to Mr. Foster. Via: Bloomberg Post navigation Previous StoryHTC Wants You to Squeeze All the Things in Preparation for New U Phone Next StoryReport: T-Mobile to Offer Its Own Commitment Free Smartphone Chip Dawg Google home looks like a big Glade air freshener, and the Pixel/XL look like iPhones 4,5,6 see ya homie!!!! Ryan Not that it matters. The PIxel is essentially a more expensive Nexus. A slightly re-skinned phone already made by someone. Nathan Bryant All Nexus/Pixel phones were re-skinned phones based off another’s flagship. Not one was built from the ground up. Reason being they always have an OEM build it. Saves time and money business wise. I wish they could make something from scratch, though. Rimtu Kahn That’s not what know. AFAIK what was special about Pixel was that it’s the first phone fully made by Google from the ground up. Previous phones from Google i.e. the nexus branded ones were rebranding and readjusted from other vendor flagships. Pixels are Google designed and implemented. Nathan Bryant The Pixel heavily resembles HTC 10 imo. A few cosmetic changes just like their past devices when branded Nexus. I’m not complaining, but there is nothing distinctive about it. Google can say they built it from the ground up all they want, but…. Suicide_Note That was the plan, but Huawei pulled out of the deal at the last minute. That’s why Google had to modify a pre-existing HTC design and use that. Defenestratus I work in an industry with some pretty bad turnover but Google puts us to shame. T_Dizzle Great, now lets get creative and innovate. DanSan one could say, they couldn’t keep him stock? ( •_•) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ ﻿(⌐■_■) YYYYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH rebretz000 I’m hoping with Rick Osterloh heading up hardware the Pixel phones will resemble the Moto X phones of 2014. Curved back for more comfort when holding it and bring better speakers then the disappointment we got with the current Pixel phone. Justin Martin I hate the curved back. impossible to use while laying flat on a desk or table. Can you say Nexus 6…. mustbepbs N..N….N-Nexus THROTTLE UNDER 50%. I tried. DanSan yes I can. Nexus 6 Killa but you could play spin the bottle with your hot coworkers using the Nexus 6. what’s wrong with that? 🙂 Suicide_Note I can say it in three different languages, if you’d like? karpodiem I’m sure there will be a Pixel 2, but this is what has prevented me from trying Android. This instability and only now providing timelines for security patch drop dead updates signals instability. I’m not going to pay $750 for this experience, sorry. Good_Ole_Pinocchio K den Nate Has nothing to do with this guy leaving lol. karpodiem It doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, either. trevorsalienarms You’re confusing the Google Pixel and it’s “pure Android experience” with other Android devices you should absolutely try. MicroNix Maybe he likes working Bluetooth? Defenestratus Guess what. Apple has turnover too! I know its unbelievable that someone can escape the brainwashing that goes on behind those closed, locked, sealed and barricaded doors. Drew You’re funny thinking Google is much different than Apple. I wouldn’t be surprised if Google locks bootloaders in future Pixel phones. karpodiem Just curious, what do you use with the unlocked bootloader? The only thing I could think of using an unlocked bootloader is to cut the $30/month tethering charge on my VZW grandfathered unlimited plan, but I’m too chicken to mess with a good thing. I don’t mind paying the $30 so that my plan is in jeopardy. I used 60GB on the road for work last month. Drew Unlocked bootloader guarantees root. Google is starting to hate it because more and more people are using apps like adaway to get rid of all ads on their phone, Google’s main source of revenue. karpodiem Ah, interesting. Suicide_Note Google doesn’t hate root. If they did they’d just lock their phones down completely. They have to tighten security to appease the banks and media companies. dunning-kruger This. People want tap and pay, mobile banking, and such, and they want it to work. Google Wallet and/or Android Pay or don’t work on rooted phones because telling people their bank account has been cleaned out because they installed the wrong app is not a conversation any bank or Google is interested in having and they have the means to prevent it, by having a part of the OS that is walled off. I really wish people could spend half the time they spend inventing and fomenting conspiracy theories thinking about or researching how things work. Drew Why should Google keep unlockable bootloaders? To keep the <5% of Pixel owners happy? You really think Google want people to root their phones now? Yeah right. Like I said it's potentially less revenue for them. Drew I’m saying I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened on future Pixel phones. DanSan i love apple turnovers! oh wait.. karpodiem I’ve railed on Apple for their desktop pricing since the last quad core mac mini came out in 2012 with Sandy Bridge. I’m no Apple fanboy. OligarchyAmbulance “only now providing timelines for security patch drop dead updates doesn’t sound like a good time.” They have said for years that devices get two years of updates, and three years of security patches. This is not new. karpodiem that’s a very short timeline to be charging $750 for a phone. Drew Especially when they release one phone every year in two different sizes, not exactly a lot of different hardware configurations to worry about. OligarchyAmbulance Blame Qualcomm, they don’t support their chips. It’s why Apple makes their own, and why Google is working on their own as well. Regardless, I’ve yet to meet a person who has a smartphone for more than 2, let alone 3 years. Suicide_Note Thank you for injecting facts into the discussion. It’s refreshing to see someone who actually understands what’s going on. MicroNix I’ve seen you making this statement an awful lot lately. Are you in the chipset business? Sell the chips? Design them? Oh heck, are you even on the stockholder list? How do you know that Qualcomm is to blame? Cite the facts and where you got them please. I’d like to see the quote from someone at an OEM or Qualcomm or Google that blames this all on Qualcomm. Please, I can’t wait to read all about it. MicroNix I know people who still have Galaxy S3s as their daily driver. There is absolutely no reason why a phone, especially any new flagship, can’t go 5 years without being replaced. Not everyone has to have the very latest phone every 2 years. These devices are reaching a plateau like desktops/laptops. Intel can put a new tag on every new chip every year but it isn’t a leap like they were 10 years ago. Same thing with the mobile chipsets. Suicide_Note What instability? Oh, you mean the instability that has led to Android having almost 90% market share. Yeah, really unstable. lol Also, Google started providing EOL timelines a while back. It’s not something they just started doing this week. In any case, hope you enjoy iOS or Windows Mobile. 🙂 Gekko I don’t hate this news like I did the Pixel. Nw_adventure Good lets put even more Bezel into the next Pixel- trevorsalienarms But muh pixel…oh noes. Why bother developing hardware anyway? Just use one of HTC’s cast offs. Drew That was the whole big deal about the Pixel. Google designed the whole thing. Honestly they should have stuck with Nexus imo. Daishi Isn’t that what the Pixel is? trevorsalienarms Exactly.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States UBS Has 4 Most Preferred Tech Stocks to Buy That Have Lagged Peers By Lee Jackson April 28, 2017 10:20 am EDT Print Email Tweet In what can only be described as a good, but shaky year, the market has had its fits and starts, after being up solidly in January and February. Investors casting a wary eye toward May, with the famous Wall Street maxim “sell in May and go away” hanging like a sword of Damocles, may want to look at strong sectors, and then look for stocks with great fundamentals that have lagged their peers in the sector. A recent UBS report focuses in on the firm’s Most Preferred Information Technology, preferring the stocks that make the list that have indeed lagged the competition. The noted this in the report: Against the backdrop of healthy corporate IT spending, continued growth in digital advertising, and challenged smartphone demand, we prefer stocks that have lagged peers but have leading fundamentals. In our view, some of the best opportunities lie in our Most Preferred names in the Software and Services. Four outstanding stocks were highlighted, and all make good sense for aggressive growth accounts. Alphabet The search giant continues to expand and is even working on a driverless car now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a global technology company focused around key areas, such as search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, enterprise and hardware products. It generates revenue primarily by delivering online advertising and by selling apps and contents on Google Play, as well as hardware products. The company provides its products and services in more than 100 languages and in 190 countries, regions and territories. Alphabet offers performance and brand advertising services. It operates through Google and Other Bets segments. The Google segment includes principal internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, such as virtual reality. The analysts point to Google Cloud, which is the largest cloud infrastructure and engages in more technology, infrastructure research and development in headcount and dollars than any other company. That gives it the strength and wherewithal to compete with and differentiate itself from Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure. The company posted massive earnings this week, hammering analysts’ expectations. Revenue beat on Sites, Networks and Google Other. Paid clicks and CPC also were ahead of consensus. Wall Street is very positive on core margin improvement. Despite approaching $100 billion revenue run-rate, the company shows no signs of slowing down. The UBS price target for the stock is $975. The Wall Street consensus target is $979.90 Shares closed before the earnings report at $891.44 but were trading at $927.01 Friday morning. Red Hat This is another solid pick for aggressive accounts. Red Hat Inc. (NYSE: RHT) is the world’s leading provider of open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to reliable and high-performing cloud, Linux, middleware, storage and virtualization technologies. Red Hat also offers award-winning support, training and consulting services. Last year the company formed a partnership with once bitter rival Microsoft that would bring more flexibility to hybrid cloud enterprise environments. Specifically, the partnership allows cloud products running under the Linux operating system to integrate with Microsoft’s cloud computing platform Azure, a huge move after years of competition. Top analyst have noted the while the on-premise world that still relies heavily on Windows, upward of 90% of the public cloud runs on Linux (not all RHEL), and many of today’s modern infrastructure concepts, such as Containers, are built on Linux. That puts Red Hat in a unique position to benefit from the hybrid cloud (a blend of public and private clouds) as customers increasingly think about application mobility. UBS has a $90 price target for the shares, and the consensus target is $94.16. The stock closed most recently at $88.15 per share.

In How Google Works, authors and Google executives Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, and Alan Eagle tell the behind-the-scenes story of life and work at Google--sharing the lessons they have learned in the hope of providing insight and inspiration to other leaders and entrepreneurs who want to build something great. The author believes that: • Businesses are most successful when they create great products that please their customers. • In today's rapidly changing marketplace, being faster to market and focusing on better quality goods are key competitive differentiators. • Every business plan has flaws, and every plan must be adjusted in response to changing circumstances. • Innovation cannot be controlled or regimented; rather, it is a natural outgrowth of creativity, inspiration, and the recognition of an unmet need. • While innovative employees should be paid well, the true motivation to innovate comes from a love of work and the opportunity to make a difference in the world. • In a technology-driven world, gathering, sharing, and processing information will be the driving force behind continued innovation that impacts every industry and endeavor.

REUTERS/Jason Lee By Supantha Mukherjee and Julia Love Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store, has long been sandwiched between Google's advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. Not any more. The business, categorized as "Other Revenue" in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday – a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. "(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "We think that is quite an impressive achievement." Alphabet does not break out revenue contribution within the "Other Revenue" segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category's clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google's cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's Azure. But Google is investing heavily. "In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. "We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017," Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. "People are hankering for a really awesome Android phone that basically gives them the iPhone experience," Wang said, adding that the growth in Google's "other revenue" bucket this quarter "shows sustained momentum for the Pixel." Still, the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue comes from ads and that's not going to change any time soon. Total advertising revenue increased 18.8 percent to $21.1 billion in the first quarter, the company reported on Thursday. Profit also rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, beating Wall Street estimates. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Alphabet's drive for diversification also includes its "Other Bets" business, considered the company's loss-making arm. The business, home to the Waymo self-driving car, Google Fiber and thermostat-maker Nest, posted a first-quarter loss of $855 million. Google's shares were up 4.6 percent at a record high of $932.73 on Friday morning. They have gained 12.5 percent this year up to Thursday's close.

Want it in your inbox every week? Subscribe here. On Le Monde, Adrien Sénecat has an excellent deconstruction of how satire and hyperpartisan truth-twisting can result in real misperceptions. Step 1: A satirical site writes that French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, caricatured as out-of-touch, feels dirty after touching poor people's hands. Step 2: Hyperpartisan Facebook pages take this at face value, mixing in footage from a video of Macron cleaning his hands after handling an eel. Step 3: A worker in a northern factory challenges Macron to shake his dirty, working class hands. While we shouldn't generalize from one example — nor is it certain the critical worker was referring to those posts specifically — this is interesting anecdotal evidence of how fake news can have real effects. Quote of the week "Truth in politics is a common good just like clean air and water, and pollution of truth will devastate our political system just as environmental pollution devastates our physical health. Fortunately, we can learn from the successes of the environmental movement." — Gleb Tsipursky in HuffPost. You can now fact-check Google Those featured snippets at the top of Google results can be very helpful — or way off. As of this week, Google has increased the feedback options so that users can signal that a snippet is misleading or inaccurate. Here's how it works if you want to fix the result for "first black President of the United States." (Related: Ben Thompson of Stratechery is "not OK" with the lack of transparency in other changes Google announced.) Brazil's fact-checking boom The Brazilian fake-busting space is getting crowded, with more than 40 journalists working full time or part time in fact-checking initiatives across the country. But there's still plenty of work for everyone, reckons Cristina Tardáguila of Lupa.

Is Wikitribune a fix for "broken news?" Wikitribune, a news platform proposed by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, claims that "the news is broken and we can fix it" with a group of community volunteers and paid journalists who will "only write articles based on facts that they can verify." Reactions are varied, and we've crowdsourced some for you here: Volunteer work is harmful to the profession of journalism (The Atlantic). News written by the people and for the people is a good thing (NiemanLab). As a model, Wikipedia is generally reliable but understaffed (Vice). Demand is uncertain for such a project (Polis). Similar efforts — thought not with Wales' firepower — have failed (Fortune). The efficient fakers' strategy Must-read from Craig Silverman at BuzzFeed: TrueTrumpers.com "shows that as long as you have a big Facebook page and can craft rage-inducing headlines and thumbnails, your website can literally have almost zero content and still make money."

Designed to help emerging readers acquire speed and accuracy in reading aloud, Fluency Tutor packs in quite a bunch of handy features. Although it has been primarily designed for the Google Apps for Education environment, Fluency Tutor works just fine with regular Google accounts as well. Teachers pick up reading passages for students to practice, based upon parameters like lexile level, reading age etc., which can be then shared with a group of students, or the entire class via Google Drive. The students can then easily practice reading the assigned passages in a relaxed environment (thus taking away the pressure of reading in a class full of students). A variety of online tools (e.g. visual and standard dictionary, text to speech) are provided to students to help them. Once done, students can record their readings, which can be then assessed by teachers. Based on the freemium service model, the paid version of Fluency Tutor also throws in extra features like detailed assessment metrics and progress tracking. Sounds like something that you (and your class) could use? Let’s find out in a bit more detail. Sponsored Links Fluency Tutor: Installation And Teacher Dashboard Since Fluency Tutor has been designed primarily for the Google Apps, it should come as no surprise that it’s available as a Google Chrome app. Installing the app and setting it up is fairly easy. Simply head over to Fluency Tutor’s homepage to add the app to Google Chrome. After installation, you can simply launch it from Chrome’s app launcher. The first time you launch the app, it asks for permission to use your Google account. Once that’s done, you should get a screen like the one shown below: As illustrated by the above screenshot, the first screen lists some basic information about the app, as well as some sample reading content (based on different grade levels) listed on the right. This content features sample stories that give you an idea of the content that will be assigned to students for practice. You can view the stories, and then click on the Go to Dashboard button on the bottom left corner to see everything in detail via your teacher dashboard (illustrated in the beginning of the article). How To Use This Free Online Service To Improve Reading Skills Of Students? Using Fluency Tutor basically involves two stages. The first stage involves the teacher assigning the reading passages to students by sharing them via Google Drive, whereas the second stage is comprised of the students practicing the passages, and submitting their recordings. Let’s take a brief look at them one by one: Stage 1: Assigning Reading Passages To Students Step 1: Go to your Dashboard, and click on Share Reading Passage(s) item from the options. Once you do that, you’re presented with a screen listing all the available reading passages, along with their lexile levels, and the reading age they are intended for. To share multiple passages with students, simply select them via checkboxes, and click the Share reading passages button. Step 2: Once you do that, Fluency Tutor will automatically create a passage file to be shared (and thus assigned) to your students. This is similar to sharing any other document via Google Drive. All you have to do is enter the email addresses of the students with whom you want to share the reading passages (It goes without saying that the students need to have Google Accounts, and Fluency Tutor installed as well), and hit the Share button. Step 3: That’s it. The reading passages have been successfully shared (and hence assigned) to students for practice. The next stage involves the students working on them, as discussed in the next section. Stage 2: Students’ Practicing The Passages And Submitting Recorded Responses Step 1: Once a student clicks on the shared passage (a notification email having the link to the shared passages is sent to each of the students), it automatically opens up in the student practice mode of Fluency Tutor. here’s a screenshot: Pretty awesome, isn’t it? As illustrated above, the student view of Fluency Tutor lists the shared passage in an easy to read view. Apart from that, there are also a lot of helpful options on the right for the students. These are briefly mentioned below: Record: This option can be used by the students to record their readings, which can be then assessed. Play/Pause: Can be used to play or pause a playing reading passage’s voiceover. Stop: Stop reading passage’s voiceover. Rewind/Forward: Go back or move ahead in the passage.

The Google parent company also beat on its top and bottom line for the period, posting adjusted earnings of $7.73 per share on revenue of $24.75 billion. That eclipsed analysts' expectations of $7.38 per share and $24.22 billion in revenue.  Shares of Alphabet were advancing 4.1% to $928.07 on Friday morning.  Alphabet is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells GOOGL? Learn more now. Other highlights included a surge in Google's "Other" segment, which saw its revenue jump 49% year-over-year during the quarter to $3.1 billion. The company doesn't break out its cloud revenues, instead lumping them in with hardware and Google Play in the "Other" segment. Executives have said that Google's cloud business could become so large that it soon eclipses the company's behemoth of an advertising business.  Ahead of earnings, Wall Street had been wary of any potential fallout from the YouTube advertising controversy that erupted late last month. Several analysts estimated that the brand safety issues could result in a $750 million dent to Alphabet's revenues in early 2017.  But that didn't seem to be the case this quarter, as Alphabet said YouTube revenues continued to grow at a "significant" rate with video advertising being a strong catalyst. When asked by an analyst if YouTube has found a permanent solution to mitigating last month's controversy, Pichai said the company is taking it "pretty seriously" and has taken significant steps to reduce the issue, such as deploying new machine learning technologies to flag offensive content.  "It is super important to us that this ecosystem works well," Pichai said on the call. "...I would say advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. Our conversations with them are very, very positive, and so I'm pretty optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here." These and other comments seemed to reassure investors, too, as Wall Street remained bullish on Alphabet shares following the results. Here's what they had to say about the quarter:  James Cakmak, Monness Crespi Hardt (Buy, PT raised to $1,050 from $900) "For awhile there, Alphabet was facing a lot of heat given issues advertisers and agencies had around YouTube...In any case, we believe those concerns are alleviated at this point, with clear focus and interest evident that addressing content issues is a top priority." Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer (Outperform, PT raised to $1,050 from $1,000) "GOOG appears to be firing on all cylinders: 1) Websites gross revenue growth accelerated from 4Q16 to 1Q17; 2) YouTube brand safety issue taken care of; 3) YouTube user engagement increasing (1B hours of video watched/day as of 1Q17); 4) YouTube TV now launched in five cities; and 5) Other bets thriving, with stable to declining losses." Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research (Hold, Price Target raised to $990 from $950)  "Alphabet reported another quarter featuring better-than-expected metrics on revenue growth, expense management and capital expenditures. In total, profit margins rose for the seventh consecutive quarter on both gross revenues (to 26.5%) and against revenue ex-traffic-acquisition costs (to 32.6%)." Scott Devitt, Stifel (Buy, PT raised to $1,075 from $1,050) "Despite approaching a $100 billion revenue run-rate, the company shows no signs of slowing down and the Alphabet's advertising profits are funding a number of compelling short, medium and longer-term investments that could develop into multi-billion dollar businesses themselves someday." Anthony DiClemente, Nomura (Buy, PT raised to $985 from $925) "GOOGL results delivered a clean beat across the board in 1Q17. While our earnings preview highlighted multiple robust checks pointing to strong growth , even these proved conservative, as Properties growth accelerated, driven once again by robust trends in mobile search, YouTube, and Google Play."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 28 April 2017 | MYT 7:48 PM Alphabet rides mobile ad binge, while moonshot spending ebbs Parent Alphabet Inc beat analysts’ sales projections in the first quarter, ending a four-year streak of missing Wall Street estimates after the holidays. — Reuters After struggling for years to wring profit from the mobile boom, Google is benefiting from a surge in clicks on ads on smartphones.  Capitalising on consumers’ shift toward handsets and away from laptops, Google crammed more ads into mobile search results, including new lucrative shopping spots, while running more promotions on its Maps app. The result: Parent Alphabet Inc beat analysts’ sales projections in the first quarter, ending a four-year streak of missing Wall Street estimates after the holidays.  Revenue in the most-recent quarter, minus payouts to partners, rose to US$20.12bil (RM87.34bil), above projections of US$19.76bil (RM85.77bil). Net income was US$7.73 (RM33.56) a share, easily beating analysts’ estimates, helped by cost controls at some of the companies moonshot projects.  Company shares rose as much as 5.2% to US$938.18 (RM4,072.64) in extended trading. The stock closed at a record earlier on Thursday in New York.  Along with mobile ads, Alphabet executives cited the growth of YouTube ads as a key driver. Major marketers paused spending recently on the video site over concern about ads running beside offensive content, but this probably had little effect on first-quarter results because it began less than two weeks before the period ended. And the boycott didn’t include search ads, the bulk of Google’s business.   Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said the company will continued to invest in technological fixes for the YouTube issue, but assured investors the problem was under control. “Advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made,” he said on a conference call with analysts. “Our conversations with them are very, very positive.”  Analysts were reassured by Pichai’s comments and the company’s results. “Bottom line, fears over demand drop-off from YouTube [were] alleviated,” said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co.  Another factor that investors may cheer came from continued cost controls at Alphabet’s most audacious projects. The company cut spending on its Other Bets units – the non-Google businesses that include its self-driving car company, Waymo. Expenditures on those divisions totaled US$170mil (RM737.20mil) during the quarter, down 39% from a year earlier. Alphabet spent more than 14 times that amount on Google.  Other Bets operating losses narrowed from the prior quarter, mainly from a pullback by the company’s Fiber broadband service. Last year, it dramatically cut back on the once-ambitious effort. On the earnings call, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said some Fiber staff were reallocated to Google.  In a letter to shareholders before Alphabet’s earnings, chief executive officer Larry Page highlighted the recent progress of the self-driving car business, saying he “can’t wait until Waymo launches.” Page also noted “significant investments” to expand Fiber and expressed excitement about “opportunities to do it better” – a nod to the efficiency drive at the broadband business. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Goldman hopes high rates will lure consumers to online bank Super Mario Run to host Mario Kart 8 Deluxe event Thai baby's murder on Facebook: The missing hours before video was removed Alphabet rides mobile ad binge, while moonshot spending ebbs Tesla's Klaus Grohmann ousted after clash with CEO Musk Why are M'sians investing hard-earned money in Ponzi schemes?

Procrastination is ow never more than a click away – it’s all too easy to find your time disappearing into your smartphone or down a Google rabbithole. But for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), every second counts. We spoke to experts from SMEs to get their advice on staying focused and dealing with distraction. Set a detailed schedule Maintaining focus is all about balancing long-term vision with short-term activities. When Cheryl Clarke, director of Ginger Marketing, needed to create an additional £3,000 of monthly turnover in 90 days, she used a structured goal-setting technique. "I broke the 90 days into two-week chunks," she explains. "Every Sunday afternoon I booked tasks into my Google Calendar for the week ahead and colour-coded them to separate goal-related tasks and everyday business tasks." Join the community | Share your small business story Using an online calendar gave Ms Clarke the flexibility to adjust her schedule when she finished something faster (or slower) than expected, ensuring that every moment of her time was used effectively. "Every fortnight, I assessed where I was and adjusted things accordingly, which left no room for procrastination," she says. Using this method of flexible planning, Ms Clarke ended up bringing in £4,000 additional monthly turnover – and well ahead of her 90-day target. Take control of your time We all have 24 hours in a day, but PR professional Amanda Ruiz makes every second count by using a timer technique. "I silence my phones, turn off alerts and close non-work browser windows, then set my kitchen timer for 30 minutes of power-working," she says. Once the alarm rings, she has five minutes to relax with her dog or walk outside before repeating the process. This keeps her focused and breaks up the spells of intense effort. Rob Williams, co-founder of clothing company, Hawthorn, works on specific jobs at set times during the day so that he doesn't end up juggling tasks and losing focus. "It gives me the best chance of achieving what I set out to do. I still answer emails, but only in the allotted time," he says. Keep your target in sight Marcus Franck, founder of renewable energy technology company, Franck Energy, makes sure that he and his workforce have complete conviction in their end goal, as well as the progress towards it. To launch, we focused very narrowly on the absolute prioritiesScott Phillips, Rise Art "From the start, we’ve communicated the business aims transparently to every team member, which helps us to achieve optimum focus," he says. "Naturally, the team has an interest in renewables, but to minimise daily distraction, we structure regular company updates." Having clear objectives is also crucial for Rise Art, an online marketplace for artists. Its four staff members got into the habit of honing in on tasks right from the outset. "To launch, we focused very narrowly on the absolute priorities, blocking all distractions," says co-founder, Scott Phillips. "It gave us extra time to test and develop the product." Take time to think To keep the company's values and goals in sight, Mark Roberts of retailer, Beer Hawk, likes to take a step back and reflect without distraction. "Our team always has new ideas, most of which we could implement and see a positive effect from," he explains. "I have to choose the best, so I need space and thinking time. "I’ve been in organisations where nobody takes responsibility for decisions, and I've learnt to set aside decision-making time, because the rewards are so fruitful.” Alexa Mullane, founder of wellbeing company, Potion London, has learnt to say no, to keep her attention focused on the right areas. She’s often approached by bloggers requesting samples, but now turns away those that don't fit her brand. "It's tempting to grab every opportunity – be it an idea for a new line or a chance of coverage," she says. "However, it’s up to you to guide your SME in the right direction and stay on course."

By Oliver Cragg April 28, 2017 15:53 BST Is Apple making a Siri-powered smart speaker?iStock Following the high profile launches of Amazon Echo and Google Home, the smart speaker market has become a hot topic in the tech sphere. While the respective Alexa and Google Assistant-powered devices arguably represent the best of the tech's grand debut, it has yet to be seen if other industry giants with their own digital assistants will follow suit. Despite prior reports to the contrary, prolific Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has suggested that the Cupertino company is building a rival device built on a variant of its mobile operating system iOS and its chatty iPhone, iPad and Mac assistant, Siri. Dickson made the claim in a series of tweets on 27 April, stating that Apple is "finalising designs" for an "Alexa competitor... expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device." The tipster also alleged that the product will "carry some form of Beats technology," referencing the hugely popular audio brand Apple purchased in 2014. On the surface, Dickson's claims sound credible – Apple clearly has the infrastructure, software and financial might to wade into the smart speaker market without any qualms. However, it would appear to contradict a recent report citing talks with unnamed Apple executives who denied such rumours, categorically stating that Apple has "no apparent interest in copying" Amazon and Google's efforts. The report also claimed that Apple sees Siri's future as an "omnipresent platform" that delivers "an AI assistant that's with you all the time, rather than tethered down to a single device." In lieu of an official Apple announcement or any confirmed interest from its upper echelon, it is worth taking all speculation on the topic of Siri smart speaker with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, with the emergent smart-speaker market estimated to become a multi-billion dollar market by 2020, the mere suggestion that Apple has broader plans for Siri appears to fit the idea of a hub-like AirPlay device that expands the assistant's reach to cover multiple Apple products. Considering Siri is already nestled in Macs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs across the world, a voice-activated hub making use of AirPlay – and potentially HomeKit for smart home control – is something many Apple fans would no doubt love to see. It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 More from IBTimes UK Google Home review: Can Google's smart speaker topple Amazon Echo and Alexa?

The Google Assistant SDK is now publicly available, allows developers to port Assistant to new devices Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:26am PDTApr 27, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Development Google News Videos One of the reasons Amazon's Alexa assistant has become so popular is because it can be integrated into nearly everything. We've seen phones, speakers, and even refrigerators with Alexa. Now Google is opening up Google Assistant to the same level of accessibility, with the new Google Assistant SDK. With the SDK, developers can integrate Assistant into existing products fairly easily. It remains to be seen how much functionality will be available to third-party devices running Assistant, as it is already fragmented on Google's own devices. But the focus seems to be primarily on voice, not visual displays like Assistant on Android. To make developing easier, the SDK includes the gRPC API, a Python client that handles user authentication and access to the API. This is especially useful if you are trying out the SDK on a Raspberry Pi or similar development board. This first version of the SDK is a Developer Preview, with several features still in development - including hotword support and companion app integration. Google has created a G+ community, a Stack Overflow tag, and a mailing list to help out developers using the SDK. I'm definitely going to try it out myself.

I might put it on the same Pi as my Plex server... maybe I can play things directly from my Plex server using just my voice :-) Eric Abreu It looks like it's actually compatible with several other platforms and languages: https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-other-platforms/ CD RW I need a Pi to build my own Google Home surethom Let's hope developers are better than Google, google cannot even get google home to add calendar entry's or even the basic like play my uploaded music by artist or song title . pfmiller Google Assistant is Google Assistant. This only allows you to access it from 3rd party devices, it's functionality is still in Google's hands. Wikiwix Who builds a Windows Client? abc Most of the world? Eric Siedlecki Does this mean manufacturers will now be able to add Assistant to their devices, therefore creating actual Google Home rivals? That'll be awesome. It could push innovation and lower prices. Yay! TheScientists Yes, that's exactly what it means. Google wants Assistant everywhere, just like Amazon wants Alexa everywhere. They don't care which device is getting the sale. Random! What's the minimum required hardware for Assistant? myssi Raspberry Pi 3 Random! ...which instantaneously adds $40+ to the BOM of any projects which didn't already contain a Raspi. Damn. I found a list where they say it should work in anything able to run Linux, Windows or MAC OS. I wish they would have been more specific about the required processing power. JG Wouldn't mind seeing a Windows based Google Assistant. Replace Cortana. Too bad, though, it appears your stuck using the "OK Google" trigger phrase. Being able to replace it with "OK Computer" would be great in this instance. Avi Faitelewicz See above: "hotword support". JG Hotword support, for the standard "ok Google" trigger. Not custom triggers. Watch the embedded video. He specifically mentioned OK Google or use of a hardware button. No mention of custom trigger phrases. Maxr1998 You could possibly create your own hotword solution to launch Assistant, though of course that's a lot more complicated. myssi hotword support https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cc9e79ed8ff9801b52ea180b2655fa8ba9654b3fa9580faae85323dcecae5328.jpg bozzykid I don't think hotword support means what you think it does.

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 39 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%. Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs and an increase in volume. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's coming earnings release drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement.

Especially as competitors like FB are taking up more of the ad pie. 😆😄 I know you read 9to5G also... today there was an article that quotes the head of Google Cloud Platform saying they will surpass Amazon in 2022. Will that do it for you? Roger Siegenthaler and you believe them? ddevito No they won't. Enterprises don't trust Google abc Surpass Amazon in what? Amazon's cloud powers many of the internet's most popular sites. If the head of Google Cloud genuinely believes that he will beat them by 2022, then he's a moron. You obviously are a fanboy, which you makes you a moron by definition. Suicide_Note Which is why they have other projects and endeavors aside from search. Do you really think that the people who run and advise Google haven't thought about this? destinyhud cloud and hardware is the next big thing for google. cloud(yearly) and hardware(quaterly) is already a billion dollar business for google. they need time to become huge Lateef Alabi-Oki Google be like... https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lFvtuqmey9QTAY/giphy.gif Dirty Dave man i miss wearing jeans that were way to big Lateef Alabi-Oki I still won't rock skinny jeans. blahmoomoo The stock price is actually up around 4% after hours.

I'll update the post with the new numbers now that markets are open (and I am awake.) charlie Jason Interesting. Hopefully this will allow them to hire some competent designers to slim down the iBezels and competent supply managers keep their phones in stock. Max Johnson They could relocate some of the employees who currently are making new messaging apps. But in seriousness looks like they're working on that already. charlie Jason Really? Maybe bezel-less is too hard, but I definitely hope for reasonably slim bezels or at least front facing speakers for Pixel 2. Suicide_Note Maybe Alphabet can also spare a few bucks to hire someone competent to make your comments witty, insightful, original, and/or funny? charlie Jason Butthurt Pixel fanboy much? Aaron The iBezel part was lame, bro. But to your defense, whomever is responsible for the Pixels must have skipped the section on supply and demand in high school economics. Suicide_Note Don't know why you would make that assumption, considering i said nothing about the Pixel, not did i express any offense about his comment. Perhaps you should prob Alphabet for a loan too, as it seems you could use some help with your reading comprehension. Fitzgerald42 Now that was clever ddevito Funny you should say that. David Foster, who ran the entire Pixel Division, just left to go back to Amazon. JD Thank goodness George yeah, those designers went to the Allo Sticker team~ charlie Jason LOL shots fired! diese does this mean we will get more messenger and sticker packs?? TheManuz I stopped when I read "our favorite UMBRELLA CORPORATION" Now i know where all their AI experimentation is aimed to! Ryne Hager Don't be a hard dog to keep under the porch, Manuz. TheManuz Damn, I had forgotten that line! ArunRock You got me at Umbrella Corporation dhamp2g To celebrate our earnings we are going to add a new money themed sticker pack. ...and add the pixel to the End of Life list.... Defenestratus Time to start looking at breaking up Google, Apple and Facebook. abc No way. It's America. I say Google, Apple and Facebook should merge into one monopolistic behemoth. Then we can hear the most capitalist country on earth whine about the lack of competition. ddevito Is there any mention of how much revenue mobile advertising produced? Because that's the number that counts. Until Google/Alphabet/whateverthehelltheycallthemselves figures out a reliable way to grow revenue on mobile this is all smoke and mirrors, which is what the whole Alphabet fiasco was about TheScientists I thought I had read a story a few months back that mobile ad revenue had already surpassed desktop. Yep, here you go: https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Moves-Majority-Share-of-Googles-Worldwide-Ad-Revenues/1014633 Ryne Hager Yeah, I would have loved to see advertising actually divided up in the quarter's revenue reports. Some other marketing firms have put together their own estimates showing that mobile is accounting for most of it now. But, without details about revenue from mobile sites vs apps, etc., those third party estimates still don't tell much. I wish Google would be transparent about that. Aaron Really does look like since they're doing this good they could have chosen a better ODM for the Pixels. Either HTC sucks at manufacturing or Google has another issue entirely. No excuse for the Pixel to still be out of stock. Daan Smit Google doesn't care about you having a Pixel or not. You're not the customer; you're their (personal)-data-generating-life-stock. They want to collect your data from any Android device you can use. Pixes is just one of them and therefore not a focus point. Google's customers are enterprises buying target-advert content based on your personal data gathered. That's where their focus is and hence the profit. destinyhud well google care about pixel now that they are making profit for them as well. Klark Kenneth Those pesky taxes! Come on Trump, hurry up and get rid of corporate taxes so the rest of us can share the burden, Google needs a new pair of shoes!! jcopernicus "They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. " The intimation that cutting back is an action to increase revenue is so hilarious. Cut backs are made to stop losses, not to stimulate growth. Defenestratus Indeed, and there is only so much cutting back you can do. Ryne Hager I was just surprised. With the projects that did get cut this year I assumed at some level there had to be losses going on, but they still exceeded estimates. Even the moonshots (at least, as a whole), which includes Fiber, were able to keep things profitable with the layoffs and cuts there. I had an expectation at some level that those cut-backs were a negative indicator, and that ended up being entirely incorrect. TechGuy22 so much money and yet google can't get their shit together Doby Gillis Gee, if only they listened to you, I'm sure they'd do so much better. /s abc Well, even a 5 year old could come up with a better messaging app. Although five year olds probably love stickers too!

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 39 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%. Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs and an increase in volume. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's coming earnings release drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement.

Especially as competitors like FB are taking up more of the ad pie. 😆😄 I know you read 9to5G also... today there was an article that quotes the head of Google Cloud Platform saying they will surpass Amazon in 2022. Will that do it for you? Roger Siegenthaler and you believe them? ddevito No they won't. Enterprises don't trust Google abc Surpass Amazon in what? Amazon's cloud powers many of the internet's most popular sites. If the head of Google Cloud genuinely believes that he will beat them by 2022, then he's a moron. You obviously are a fanboy, which you makes you a moron by definition. Suicide_Note Which is why they have other projects and endeavors aside from search. Do you really think that the people who run and advise Google haven't thought about this? destinyhud cloud and hardware is the next big thing for google. cloud(yearly) and hardware(quaterly) is already a billion dollar business for google. they need time to become huge Lateef Alabi-Oki Google be like... https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lFvtuqmey9QTAY/giphy.gif Dirty Dave man i miss wearing jeans that were way to big Lateef Alabi-Oki I still won't rock skinny jeans. blahmoomoo The stock price is actually up around 4% after hours.

I'll update the post with the new numbers now that markets are open (and I am awake.) charlie Jason Interesting. Hopefully this will allow them to hire some competent designers to slim down the iBezels and competent supply managers keep their phones in stock. Max Johnson They could relocate some of the employees who currently are making new messaging apps. But in seriousness looks like they're working on that already. charlie Jason Really? Maybe bezel-less is too hard, but I definitely hope for reasonably slim bezels or at least front facing speakers for Pixel 2. Suicide_Note Maybe Alphabet can also spare a few bucks to hire someone competent to make your comments witty, insightful, original, and/or funny? charlie Jason Butthurt Pixel fanboy much? Aaron The iBezel part was lame, bro. But to your defense, whomever is responsible for the Pixels must have skipped the section on supply and demand in high school economics. Suicide_Note Don't know why you would make that assumption, considering i said nothing about the Pixel, not did i express any offense about his comment. Perhaps you should prob Alphabet for a loan too, as it seems you could use some help with your reading comprehension. Fitzgerald42 Now that was clever ddevito Funny you should say that. David Foster, who ran the entire Pixel Division, just left to go back to Amazon. JD Thank goodness George yeah, those designers went to the Allo Sticker team~ charlie Jason LOL shots fired! diese does this mean we will get more messenger and sticker packs?? TheManuz I stopped when I read "our favorite UMBRELLA CORPORATION" Now i know where all their AI experimentation is aimed to! Ryne Hager Don't be a hard dog to keep under the porch, Manuz. TheManuz Damn, I had forgotten that line! ArunRock You got me at Umbrella Corporation dhamp2g To celebrate our earnings we are going to add a new money themed sticker pack. ...and add the pixel to the End of Life list.... Defenestratus Time to start looking at breaking up Google, Apple and Facebook. abc No way. It's America. I say Google, Apple and Facebook should merge into one monopolistic behemoth. Then we can hear the most capitalist country on earth whine about the lack of competition. ddevito Is there any mention of how much revenue mobile advertising produced? Because that's the number that counts. Until Google/Alphabet/whateverthehelltheycallthemselves figures out a reliable way to grow revenue on mobile this is all smoke and mirrors, which is what the whole Alphabet fiasco was about TheScientists I thought I had read a story a few months back that mobile ad revenue had already surpassed desktop. Yep, here you go: https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Moves-Majority-Share-of-Googles-Worldwide-Ad-Revenues/1014633 Ryne Hager Yeah, I would have loved to see advertising actually divided up in the quarter's revenue reports. Some other marketing firms have put together their own estimates showing that mobile is accounting for most of it now. But, without details about revenue from mobile sites vs apps, etc., those third party estimates still don't tell much. I wish Google would be transparent about that. Aaron Really does look like since they're doing this good they could have chosen a better ODM for the Pixels. Either HTC sucks at manufacturing or Google has another issue entirely. No excuse for the Pixel to still be out of stock. Daan Smit Google doesn't care about you having a Pixel or not. You're not the customer; you're their (personal)-data-generating-life-stock. They want to collect your data from any Android device you can use. Pixes is just one of them and therefore not a focus point. Google's customers are enterprises buying target-advert content based on your personal data gathered. That's where their focus is and hence the profit. destinyhud well google care about pixel now that they are making profit for them as well. Klark Kenneth Those pesky taxes! Come on Trump, hurry up and get rid of corporate taxes so the rest of us can share the burden, Google needs a new pair of shoes!! jcopernicus "They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. " The intimation that cutting back is an action to increase revenue is so hilarious. Cut backs are made to stop losses, not to stimulate growth. Defenestratus Indeed, and there is only so much cutting back you can do. Ryne Hager I was just surprised. With the projects that did get cut this year I assumed at some level there had to be losses going on, but they still exceeded estimates. Even the moonshots (at least, as a whole), which includes Fiber, were able to keep things profitable with the layoffs and cuts there. I had an expectation at some level that those cut-backs were a negative indicator, and that ended up being entirely incorrect. TechGuy22 so much money and yet google can't get their shit together Doby Gillis Gee, if only they listened to you, I'm sure they'd do so much better. /s abc Well, even a 5 year old could come up with a better messaging app. Although five year olds probably love stickers too!

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 316 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares534 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 466k 142k 112k Latest Deals 7 [Deal Alert] Ecobee3 thermostat is now just $176.16 at Amazon ($72 off) 2017/04/28 5:58pm PDTApr 28, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Get your weekend started with 18 temporarily free and 23 on-sale apps 2017/04/28 2:21pm PDTApr 28, 2017 33 [Update: G6 and Watch Style for $650] Pre-orders for the unlocked LG G6 are live on B&H for $599.99 2017/04/28 12:15pm PDTApr 28, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Bose QuietComfort 25 down 25% to $225 on Amazon and eBay 2017/04/27 5:19am PDTApr 27, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Get a Verizon/unlocked Galaxy S8 with warranty for just $699.99 ($56 off) from a reputable eBay seller 2017/04/26 3:46pm PDTApr 26, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Using multi-user media controls on Google Home: How it works Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:09am PDTApr 27, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Google Home News Tips & Tutorials Article Contents 1 Playing music 2 Playing YouTube videos on Chromecast 3 Playing movies and TV shows on Chromecast 4 Playing media on linked speakers and televisions 5 Guests and unlinked users in your house Now that Google has enabled multi-user support for Google Home, what can you do with your media? After a little research and a chat with Google Home support, I have the answer to that question. Keep in mind, this is the situation as of today. As we always do, we hope for these features to be fine-tuned and expanded. This article assumes each user has already linked up to the Google Homes in their household. This is an easy process that the Google Home app will walk you through for each multi-user equipped device. Playing music Google will let each user have their own default music provider. No more sharing your Google Play Music. Tapping the “Feeling Lucky?” card will no longer subject you to periodic blasts of your housemate’s heavy metal music mixed in with your preferred history of listening to R&B tracks. With this new feature, your Home will use your preferred service when you make a music request. You will still be able to use other linked services, including those attached to other users' accounts, by simply adding the name of the service to your request. Each user can select their default music provider. Let's go through some examples. Let me introduce you to Carolina and Eric, roommates living in a condo with three Google Homes. Carolina's default music service is Google Play Music and Eric's is Spotify. Each have their own premium accounts. Here are some sample requests and what would result from them. Request Result Carolina requests a playlist without specifying a service Home plays the playlist using her Google Play Music account Carolina requests a playlist and ends it with "on Spotify" Home plays the playlist using Eric's Spotify account Eric requests a playlist without specifying a service Home plays the playlist using his Spotify account Eric requests a playlist and ends it with "on Google Play Music" Home plays the playlist using Carolina's Google Play Music account As you can see, one of the great benefits here is that both users have access to the other's premium account. Carolina and Eric can play each other's playlists if they know the playlist's name. Service generated playlists are also available to both. In addition to these services, you can also link Pandora (free or premium) and YouTube Music to users' accounts. During my testing, I discovered an interesting flaw (or feature?) that Google was unaware of. I found out that, using my example users, if Eric is playing a track on Carolina's Google Play Music and tells Home that he likes it, it will be added to Carolina's "Thumbs Up" list. It works the same for Spotify. If Carolina says she likes a song on Eric's Spotify account, it's marked as liked on Eric's account. Both of these actions will affect the associated playlist and influence auto playlists. A representative at Google Support told me they were sharing this issue I encountered with their developers. At the time of this writing, the flaw still exists - so be nice to the other users in your household or find your "Thumbs Up" playlist full of hated tracks. Eric's heavy metal taste infiltrates Carolina's preference for pop hits. Playing YouTube videos on Chromecast When it comes to video, the situation is similar to music but the amount of voice control is limited. Making requests to play videos from YouTube with no further specification will play media based on the individual's YouTube account. Each individual's watch history will be updated accordingly. There is no crossover. Furthermore, you can't like or dislike videos through the Home, so that mix of tastes you see with music won't happen. Playing movies and TV shows on Chromecast Currently, the only premium movie and TV service supported is Netflix. Your Home will play from your linked Netflix service or, if you didn't link one, it will play from the Netflix account of another linked user. In other words, Netflix is shared across all users. You can't like or dislike Netflix media from the Home. Simple. Playing media on linked speakers and televisions Here is where it the doors are wide open. All users' speakers, TVs, and speaker groups are shared across all users. By trailing your request with a specific device or named group, the media will be directed there. If Carolina has defined a speaker group named "Chill Zone" that includes her Chromecast audio connected to her stereo receiver and the Home in her bathroom, any user can send media to that group. That sounds like a great way for Eric to wake her up at 5:00am just for fun. Guests and unlinked users in your house If an unlinked user, such as a visitor, makes a media request, the Google Home will use the service associated with the first person who linked their voice to that Google Home. The media services connected by this person become the default services. If a request is made using a service that the first user has not set up, the service set up by another user will be used. Carolina was the first to link her voice on each Google Home. She doesn't have a Netflix account but Eric has linked his Netflix account in the Google Home app. If a request to play music is made without specifying a service, it will play from Carolina's Play Music account. If a request to play a movie on Netflix is made, it will use Eric's Netflix account. The Google Home app has a separate process for linking your voice. Here is where it seems Google has dropped the ball (again?). There is no way to identify who the first linked voice belongs to using the Home app. Google's help page literally tells you to poll all the users in your house to determine who linked their voice first: This user is likely the person who set up Google Home, but may not be if that person hasn't linked their voice. There is no way to tell who first linked their Google Account and voice from within the Google Home app. You must ask all linked users when they linked their Google Account and voice to be sure who is the first person. Here's how to manage linked users. So, if you are adding Homes to your household over time, you'll have to call a meeting and do an investigation if you happen to have forgotten this important fact. Alternatively, you can reset your Homes and systematically set them up again. Once you have everything set up, the media sharing is a nice feature that moves Google Home another step forward. Just don't ask it to remind you to buy milk. It's still learning. Source: Google Tags google home Google Music netflix spotify youtube subscribe ...

Google can tell who's talking to them. morteum So what if two users each have their own Spotify premium account and each want to use their own account? Is that possible or do they have to use different services like you gave in your example? David Ruddock It should work fine. It recognizes your voice and would use your account. snowglyder I'm guessing the same for Google Music. We have a Family Shared Plan, but currently when my wife or kids are at home and tell Google Home to play something, it stops playing for me at work because it's limited to one device at a time. It'd be awesome if my wife asked Google Home to play a song, it would use her Google Music account. Paul Quinn I'm betting that this is all tied up in licensing agreements for the music and how it is allowed to be played. bekifft This particular scenario actually sounds like a bug since it's inconsistent with the behavior the rest of the time, defaulting to the most premium service available. That or the multi user isn't set up yet. Aaron Berlin What if an unrecognized third person gives a command? Which account does it use and can that be changed? David Ruddock This is addressed in the unlinked user section. Paul Quinn If you mean media requests, that's covered in the last section of the article. Aaron Berlin That's what I get for trying to multi-task! Itchy_Robot Can I ask it to play individual songs or albums through Google Music yet... or does it still only play pre-made Playlists? Paul Quinn Sure you can. That's been possible all along. Only tracks and albums in Google's catalog though. rslh I uploaded all my songs (not on Play Music catalog) and grouped them in separate Playlists, and GH is able to play my songs from these different playlists! It's really sweet! Paul Quinn Yes. Although one snag is you can't call up individual tracks or albums from your personal library if they aren't in Google's catalog. You have to put them in a playlist to get to them like you did. Google is aware of this but no word in when. mesername So, what if I have a premium Google Play Music account and my roommate has a regular Google Play Music account? If she gives a command to play some song, can it default to my more expansive same service? David Ruddock This is a good question. Paul Quinn I did not test this scenario but based on all the testing I did, i think it would opt into your premium account. I would have to test it later. I'm not sure if you can call on someone's service by name. If you don't say something like, "... On Eric's Google Play Music account," it's going to go for the premium account of the first linked voice. There are a lot of possible scenarios. I couldn't test them all. mesername Understood. I agree, there are lots of ways Google could try to gracefully handle this. If her account doesn't have that song, it could look to another account that does, or it could just always default to the "most premium" version of the service. Like you said, it could also respond based on naming the user's account. Nobody said this was going to be easy...(stop reading here to avoid snarky comment)...except maybe Trump. I bet he would say, "I've got the best, the greatest voice actions...I know the most successful voices, and they'll always be clear, so clear, you won't believe how clear their voices are." Sorry, couldn't resist. Paul Quinn I just tried to test it but one of my Homes contains the name of the other person in my house. When I asked it to play his Google Play Music account, it interpreted it to mean playing Google Play Music on the Google Home with his name, not his account. There are just SO MANY permutations here. I didn't mention it my article but Google was not even aware of that thumbs up issue until I brought it to them. They can't even keep up with all the angles. I get it though. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm still waiting for Google to let us use Home to control media on Android TV. At the very least, give us the ability to play, pause, seek, stop, and control the volume of media of whatever is currently playing. Anything to reduce my reliance on that God-forsaken Shield TV remote, which I can never find in the dark half the time, is a blessing. youareme7 haha no joke, i lose it on the wood table right next to me, then of course i touch the volume bar and it starts blasting, mostly stick with the fire stick remote tho that doesn't do volume Lindajgomez My last paycheck was $22500 for working 12 hours a week online.Start earning $97/hour by working online from your home for few hours each day with GOOGLE...

Cory S I'd like to be able to setup a default device for actions that require a display. Unless I specify otherwise play youtube videos and photos on TV X, don't just fail the command. pfmiller I think they should have a default playback device for each Home device. That way depending on which Home receives the request the video can play on the nearest TV. Paul Quinn That's an excellent idea. I have done a little testing in this area. It will not play to a chromecast unless I specify which one. It will ask me to be more specific and it's sitting about 3 feet from the TV I want it to pay on. HEY GOOGLE - READ THIS SUGGESTION! bekifft That is ridiculous it can't do that, but it can do Chromecasts. Voice control of video is one of the very few things I really like about this thing, that only it can do. Lars Jeppesen Has anyone managed to get multi user control working outside the States? I bought 3 GH, I'm located in Denmark, using US english as language on the GH.. but the multi-voice settings don't appear in the Home application... Would a VPN connection with my phone suffice, or do I have to fake my location as well? Wonder why Google has restricted this feature to US only.. so weird.. Cory S How accurate is it at correctly identifying users? My pixel would fail "okay Google" all the time for voice unlock because it couldn't match my voice. Paul Quinn That is a highly variable issue that depends on the amount of difference between voices in the household. I'm sure it works great between a male and female or an adult and child. Mine has two male voices linked and it has stated it can't identify which one it is a couple of times. However, the majority of the time, it is successful. I don't use voice unlock because I don't think it's secure enough. In your case though, I don't know why it's not working. Eyebolt I have a Play Music Family account that I have my wife on. Currently (without multiuser set up on Home) if she's playing music on the Home (set up with my account) with Play Music and I start listening to Play Music in my car...the music stops for her (or the nightmare scenario...it stops for my kids). The whole, one account attempting to listen in two places thing. Now...what i'm curious about is that since she's on the Play Music Family account...if she plays music at Home (with multiuser set up) does it use her seat on the Family Plan to play the music??? So then I can listen elsewhere without shutting her (or the kids) down.

The scam was allegedly carried out by a Lithuanian man, Evaldas Rimasauskas. Over a two-year span, the corporate imposter convinced accounting departments at the two tech companies to make transfers worth tens of millions of dollars. By the time the firms figured out what was going on, Rimasauskas had coaxed out over $100 million in payments, which he promptly stashed in bank accounts across Eastern Europe. Google said that all of its money has been recovered, while Facebook said this was true of ‘the bulk’ of its funds, but questions are still being asked of both organisations … The identities of the two companies were initially kept secret, referred to as Company 1 and Company 2, though Fortune notes there were some fairly big clues in the descriptions assigned to them. Company 1 was described as a ‘multinational technology company, specializing in Internet-related services and products,’ while Company 2 was ‘a multinational corporation providing online social media and networking services.’ Both companies later confirmed they were the victims. However, neither company had disclosed their losses to investors, which Fortune says is leading to questions. When a publicly traded company experiences a significant event, federal securities law requires it to disclose this to investors. Such an incident (a “material event” in legal lingo) might include the departure of an executive or a problem with an important product—or a fraud worth tens of millions of dollars […] In some cases, a company must file a public form known as an 8-K with the SEC within four days of learning about it. Other times, White said, disclosure may take the form of a press release or a note in the company’s quarterly filings. While $100M is not a large sum in the context of the balance sheets of either company, and the bulk of the money was in any case recovered, former Securities & Exchange Commission head Mary Jo White says that this doesn’t necessarily eliminate the need to report the incident. The “material event” in this case may amount to more than the company losing some money, according to White, who was aware of the indictment when she spoke to Fortune, but not the identity of the companies involved. “I think companies need to be looking more broadly than that – not just at operational direct loss,” said White. “There’s the possibility of reputational damage. What does this say about internal controls over assets?” Both companies reportedly take the view that the incident did not amount to a material event.

With a Google logo stamped on the back, the phones weren’t just crafted around the purest vision for Android, they gave us hope that we would finally have a phone that received years of updates. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Google has updated the Check & update your Android version page of the Nexus support section to include the Pixel and Pixel XL, and the obsolete dates are the same as the Nexus devices that came before. For version updates, Google says, “Pixel phones get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device first became available on the Google Store. After 2 years, we can’t guarantee additional updates.” Security updates are a little longer, lasting for “at least 3 years from when the device first became available on the Google Store, or at least 18 months from when the Google Store last sold the device, whichever is longer.” Mentioned in this article Pixel XL  Greenbot rating $769.00MSRP $769.00View on Google More than just another Nexus, the Pixel has what it takes to compete with other high-priced premium phones. Read Greenbot's full review While the “at least” qualifier leaves some wiggle room, it’s unlikely that the Pixel will receive the Android Q update or that Google will pay any attention to it after October 2019. Google uses the same “not guaranteed” qualifier on the two- and three-year Nexus phone limits, and right on schedule, Google stopped sending updates to the Nexus 6 and 9, which was released in November 2014, earlier this year. Pixel pessimism: Two years of updates might sound good if you just bought a Galaxy S8 or an LG G6, but this is a bummer for Pixel owners. Google really had a chance to change the game here for Android users, but it’s opting to stick with the same disappointing upgrade schedule for seemingly no reason. The iPhone 5 was released in 2012 with iOS 6. You can still put the latest version iOS 10.3 on it, and it’s only because of the iPhone 5’s 32-bit processor that it won’t receive iOS 11. Google could have done the same thing and rewarded Pixel purchasers with years and years of updates, but instead it’s leaving them out in the cold.

On your way there you grab a latte at Starbucks. After a few good hours of shopping, you head to Panera to meet a friend for lunch. You Venmo her for the meal and then you both decide dessert is in the cards: Next stop, Häagen-Dazs. All these brands are staples in our lives. But do you have any idea what their names actually mean? We're here to help. Pepsi was named after the medical term for indigestion.  (Getty Images for Pepsi) The inventor of Pepsi, Caleb Davis Bradham, originally wanted to be a doctor, but a family crisis meant that he left medical school and became a pharmacist instead, according to the company website. His original invention, known as “Brad’s Drink,” was made from a mix of sugar, water, caramel, lemon oil, and nutmeg. Three years later, Bradham renamed his drink, which he believed aided digestion, to “Pepsi-Cola," taken from the word dyspepsia, meaning indigestion. Panera is a portmanteau of the words "pan" and "era."  () According to Panera's Facebook page, the sandwich chain's name "has Latin and Spanish roots." In Spanish, "pan" means bread and "era" means age or time. So put together, Panera means "age of bread." Ron Shaich, the founder of Panera, also told Fortune the name comes from the Latin word for breadbasket.   Google owes its name to a typo.  (AFP/Getty Images) Google's name emerged from a brainstorming session at Stanford University. Founder Larry Page was coming up with ideas for a massive data-index website with other graduate students, Business Insider reported. One of the suggestions was "googolplex" one of the largest describable numbers. The name 'Google' came about after one of the students accidentally spelled it wrong. Page then registered his company with this name. McDonald's is named after two brothers who ran a burger restaurant.  (Getty Images/iStockphoto) Raymond Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, was a milkshake machine salesman when he first met brothers Dick and Mac McDonald, who ran a burger restaurant in San Bernardino, California. The McDonald brothers bought several of his Kroc's Multimixers and he was so impressed by their burger restaurant that he became their agent and set up franchises around the US, Money reported. Years later, he bought rights to the McDonald's name.  Adidas isn't an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Soccer."  Adidas x Parley Collection 2017 (Image: Adidas) If you, like me, thought Adidas stood for "All Day I Dream About Soccer," you're wrong. It turns out the athletics-apparel brand is named after its founder, Adolf Dassler, who started making sport shoes when he came back from serving in World War I, according to the LA Times. The name combines his nickname, Adi, and the first three letters of his last name. J. Crew's name set it up to compete with Ralph Lauren's Polo line. J. Crew sells a lot of great basics like blazers, but you can't wear jeans to work in certain industries. According to Forbes, "The name Crew was picked to compete with Ralph Lauren’s Polo label and [founder Arthur] Cinader added the J because he thought it added [cachet]." Makes sense. Polo and crew are both pretty preppy sports.   "A genie whispered 'Rolex,'" in the founder's ear. (Pic: Rolex) (Rolex) Hans Wilsdorf, the founder of Rolex, wanted a brand name that could be said in any language, Business Insider reported. "I tried combining the letters of the alphabet in every possible way," said Wilsdorf, according to Rolex. "This gave me some hundred names, but none of them felt quite right. One morning, while riding on the upper deck of a horse-drawn omnibus along Cheapside in the City of London, a genie whispered 'Rolex' in my ear."  Lululemon means nothing at all. And it's intentionally hard to pronounce.  () Lululemon founder Chip Wilson came up with the yoga-wear brand's name because he thought Japanese people wouldn't be able to pronounce it.  He wrote in 2009: "It was thought that a Japanese marketing firm would not try to create a North American sounding brand with the letter 'L' because the sound does not exist in Japanese phonetics. By including an 'L' in the name it was thought the Japanese consumer would find the name innately North American and authentic." "In essence, the name 'lululemon' has no roots and means nothing other than it has 3 'L's' in it. Nothing more and nothing less." A representative for Lululemon told Business Insider that the brand's name was chosen from a list of 20 brand names and 20 logos by a group of 100 people.  Zara came from Zorba, it's original name.  (ALEXANDER JOE/AFP/Getty Images) Zara founder Amancio Ortega originally named his company after the 1964 film, “Zorba the Greek." But this didn't last long. The first store, which opened in La Coruña in 1975, happened to be two blocks down from a bar called Zorba, The New York Times reported. Ortega had already made the mould for the letters of his sign when the bar owner told him that it was too confusing for them to have the same name. In the end, Ortega ended up rearranging the letters to make the closest word he could come up with — hence Zara, according to The New York Times. ASOS is an abbreviation of AsSeenOnScreen. The British online retailer was founded as AsSeenOnScreen in 1999 and lived at asseenonscreen.com. The abbreviation ASOS — which, by the way, is pronounced ACE-OSS — quickly caught on, and the website was shortened to asos.com. IKEA isn't actually a Swedish word. (Getty istock) IKEA isn't a Swedish word that you don't understand. Founder Ingvar Kamprad chose the brand name by combining the initials of his own name, IK, with the first letters of the farm and village, where grew up in southern Sweden: Elmtaryd and Agunnaryd. Starbucks is named after a character in Moby-Dick. (Getty Images) In an interview with The Seattle Times, Starbucks cofounder Gordon Bowker told the story of how they arrived at the name. At first, they were going through a list of words beginning with "st" because they thought those were powerful.  "Somebody somehow came up with an old mining map of the Cascades and Mount Rainier, and there was an old mining town called Starbo," he said. "As soon as I saw Starbo, I, of course, jumped to Melville's first mate [named Starbuck] in Moby-Dick." Soylent gets its name from a sci-fi novel.  Drink up your dinner: Rob Rhinehart with a packet of Soylent, the nutritionally complete liquid food substitute (AFP) Soylent — that meal-replacement drink that's a Silicon Valley favorite — got its name from the science-fiction novel "Make Room! Make Room!" which is about how population growth depletes the world's natural resources. In the book, soylent is a blend of soybeans and lentils.  Gap refers to the generation gap between adults and kids. Gap Inc announced plans to close 175 Gap stores, almost a quarter of its total US footprint (Getty) The first Gap store opened in 1969 with the goal of selling good jeans. The name referred to the generation gap between adults and kids.  Wawa is named after an area of Pennsylvania. The convenience-store chain's name means two things: 1. It's the name of the area in Pennsylvania where the company's first dairy farm was located. 2. It's a Native American word for a Canada Goose (the one pictured in the company's logo). Häagen-Dazs may sound Danish, but it's completely made up. (Facebook / Häagen-Dazs) Reuben Mattus, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, named his ice-cream company Häagen-Dazs as a way to pay tribute to Denmark, according to an interview with the Jewish news publication Tablet Magazine. But the name doesn't actually mean anything. “The only country which saved the Jews during World War II was Denmark, so I put together a totally fictitious Danish name and had it registered,” Mattus said. “Häagen-Dazs doesn’t mean anything. [But] it would attract attention, especially with the umlaut.” Nike is the Greek goddess of victory. () Gatorade was developed for the Florida Gators.  (Getty Images) A team of doctors at the University of Florida developed the sports drink for the Florida Gators football players, who were struggling to play in the heat.   Venmo was inspired by a dead language.  Andrew Kortina, founder of the digital-payments app, writes on Quora: "When we were brainstorming names, one of the roots we were exploring for inspiration was the Latin, vendo/vendere, 'to sell.' As soon as we said venmo, we liked it because it was short and made for a good verb: 'Just Venmo me for dinner.'" Under Armour decided to use the British spelling because it made a better phone number. The name Under Armour came about somewhat accidentally, according to The Washington Post's interview with CEO Kevin Plank. Plank said he had landed on the name Body Armor, but couldn't get the name trademarked. He told The Post: "I was a bit dejected, but I had lunch plans that afternoon with my oldest brother, Bill. So, I show up to pick him up, knock on the door, and he looks down at me the way only an older brother can look at a younger brother, and he asks, “How’s that company you’re working on, uhh ... Under Armor?” So how did Under Armour end up with that weird spelling? "The reason we added the 'U' in 'Armour' is that I was skeptical at the time about whether this whole internet thing would stick," Plank told The Post. "So I thought the phone number 888-4ARMOUR was much more compelling than 888-44ARMOR. I wish there was a little more science or an entire marketing study behind it, but it was that simple." Amazon was named after the world's biggest river. (Reuters) When Amazon first launched in 1995, founder Jeff Bezos had a different idea for his brand name. Bezos wanted to call his online bookstore Cadabra, according to Brad Stone's book about the company. But Amazon's first lawyer, Todd Tarbert, managed to convince him that the name sounded too similar to "Cadaver." Bezos is also said to have favored the name Relentless, and if you visit Relentless.com today, you'll be redirected to Amazon's website, Business Insider reported.  Bezos finally settled on Amazon, named after the largest river in the world, and incorporated an image of the river in the company's first logo. Monsanto is the middle name of the founder's wife. (Reuters) Agrochemical company Monsanto was founded in 1901 by John F. Queeny. He named the business after his wife, Olga Monsanto Queeny.  Verizon stems from the latin word Veritas, meaning "truth."  () Verizon was the product of a merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE, both telecommunications companies. The name is a mix between the latin word "veritas" meaning "truth," and horizon, which is meant to signify that the brand is forward-looking.  JCPenney is named after its founder, whose name is just too good to be true.  With a name like James Cash Penney, it's as if the retail founder was born to make money.   Read more: • Trump is about to use a budget trick to steal from an entire generation • 14 foods you can eat as much of as you want and not gain weight • Scientists have solved the 100-year-old mystery of Antarctica's Blood Falls Read the original article on Business Insider UK. © 2016.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares163 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution.

They respond within moments, but that response is always boilerplate like you mentioned. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Charles222 I usually roll with Google auto-creating events in calendar for me like they do, and the random stuff that doesn't float through my email goes to Todoist. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Charles222 Having a few Homes around the house is what pushed it for me. I'll remember some random-ass thing I need to do in the future, and I don't take my phone to bed (or have it particularly nearby generally at home) as a rule...but I do have a Home in the bedroom and just being able to talk to to Todoist to set up an event is fantastic. Scott Scrivens That sounds pretty great. If I get Home I'll definitely check it out. Also "Homes around the house" sounds funny. Maybe Google didn't think the name through. Charles222 haha, yeah, I suppose it does. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. bekifft Pretty sure that one was for example, I doubt his dog's name is actually Fido. I admit it is kind of unlikely you'd get that many reminders in one notification, but it does illustrate the point that Google hasn't quite thought the system through. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v bekifft This happens to me too. Not so extreme, but it seemingly sometimes takes Google quite a while to realize I'm home for reminders. Which is strange because they bloody well know that I'm home, they spend all day burning through my battery to make sure they know where I am at all times. Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Scott Scrivens I have tried Tick-Tick actually, and I seem to remember not liking the UX. It's seems it's had a considerable makeover since then though so I'll check it out again, cheers. Jock Murray I use Business Tasks by Appgenix-software.com I don't think Google realise the importance of their Google Tasks. The ability to nest tasks and have descriptions/comments attached to each task, is critical. Keep users don't know what they're missing out on. Scott Scrivens Looks good, I'll check it out! pantagruel I use Business Calendar 2 with support for Google Tasks built in. Smarter choice if you use your calendar as well. bekifft Since we're recommending apps, this one seems the best, and uses Google Tasks as its back end. Come to think of it, I'm not sure Google Tasks even has an official front end anymore, but Google seems to have forgotten to shut it down. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo Scott Scrivens Think I've tried this one before and wasn't overly enamored by the UX, sadly. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 Rafael Reinoldes But it can't handle nested itens :( N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. morrisp Well, it won't appear (or notify you) on the desktop Calendar -- but will still notify you in the Calendar app, yes? N8SLC Yes, morrisp. :) Scott Scrivens Nope. It straight up won't give you a notification at all. It acts as though reminders are turned off altogether. If you set the reminder in another app, those will still notify you. But if you set the reminder in Calendar (app or desktop), and turn the reminder calendar off, you won't get a notification. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. F4LL0U7 If you're talking about reminders set through the Google app, you have to go into the Google app's settings and enable sound & vibration for those notifications. I think they're off by default. ellett Nope, I don't use reminders through the Google app. I do all of my calendar-related operations through Calendar. Putting appointments, reminders, notifications and alarms in different places is just plain wrong. F4LL0U7 Ha, you have a point. It might seem obvious, but you just might want to check and make sure the notification sound is enabled in Calendar also. I think that one might be off by default too. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. iCON You are talking about a company that has six different messengers... Scott Scrivens I'd say it's more about whether it's profitable, rather than whether it's possible. Sad truth. F4LL0U7 There was a recent article on AP (I forget who wrote it) about Google's messenger strategy (or lack thereof) that seemed pretty spot-on. I would bet their reminder strategy is pretty similar. bekifft That, and I don't think they've had a clear reminders strategy from the beginning, and probably still don't. With reminders tied into all these services, it's probably an engineering nightmare at this point. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Naxx ENVY ^ this , his phones on like 5% , hes like . i forgot something , let me check my list ... oh right yea charge phone . Scott Scrivens Because the battery on my Nexus 5X doesn't last the whole day. So a reminder to charge it at around 4PM is useful. I'm not always able to, but if I intend to be out of the house in the evening it's a necessity unfortunately 😩 Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to.

Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different Scott Scrivens Agree with Luzandro. It's probably the best option but still not as good as the Google app input method. bekifft Yes and ironically the Google app does not yet have any app shortcuts. Add Reminder and View Reminders would be two excellent choices. TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. morrisp The stock iOS Reminders app is indeed buggy -- notifications sometimes don't go off. It's a big problem! I recently switched to using an app called MinimaList for most of my reminders. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like. Scott Scrivens You're right about this, and it does work well enough. I just wish Inbox reminder notifications wouldn't disappear after a random amount of time. Miguel Hernandez I know this may sound blasphemous to some in this community but how about Cortana? It has a widget that show upcoming reminders and easy add reminder button and is cross-device with Windows 10. Antonio Gabbiano Exactly the same thoughts that I have. The fastest way to add a reminder is via shortcut for Inbox. Hanny Yeung Google Reminder as a new separate app in 3...2...1... Btw, I use Loop for my recurring reminders. Good design & usability, plus I can track my habit performance (I saw Vitamins in your calendar and that seems to be a suitable entry for Loop). Everything else are occasional, so they're in Google, created by voice command. Agreed an app shortcut from Google app and a separation of each reminder in notifications would make life easier. Vivek Shah I completely agree with Scott. The reminder options in Google Calendar desperately needs a overhaul. Hope they're reading this. Polyterative Calendar is great but abbandoned by google.. I'm a power user and these annoyances are really bad bekifft I wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's definitely not a core product anymore. They made it to compete with Microsoft and Exchange back in the day, and it was effective at that, but that's not what they care about anymore. So actually yeah, I can see how it is kind of abandoned. _jack_ Tbh, that's why I use another app for reminders and to-dos. I hate this inconsistencies, and a dedicated service for reminders isn't a bad idea (especially when using them extensively). makapav Not to mention there is no option to make the reminder notification more aggressive: intensity, repeat, persistence. vodanium I really miss that, too! Sometimes I want a reminder to really grasp my attention to do the task at the very moment. In other cases, though, it is not an issue to miss the notification for a few minutes/hours - most of the to-do activities are like this. I've been using The Clock app for "hard" notifications, but it is far from being ideal: e.g. it can be used for reminders within one week only, no option for sophisticated recurrences (e.g. bi-weekly), etc. makapav In other words - it's a usability clusterfuck. fnquaso Actually, Google Tasks does have a (hidden) webpage: https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas bekifft I've started using this app specifically for recurring reminders. Not sure whether it's a good thing or bad thing that Google leaves these gaping holes to third party providers, but here check it out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bleyl.recurrence&hl=en Rafael Reinoldes Not to mention their task management system, We can create a task list in keep, export it to docs and suddenly they were not tasks anymore, while gmail still have a half-baked task functionality that doesn't support remainders, but supports nested items!! Rafael Reinoldes Forgot about the inability to import lists from docs to keep again Rafael Reinoldes Did you said 'chrome'?!? How could anyone set a remainder from chrome? Scott Scrivens Search "add reminder" in Google. As long as you're signed into your Google account you'll get this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b7f84553cb8c9298712a98dc6a5f355c79fb13f00154d89a39eaa785046cdab9.png Rafael Reinoldes Not working here, even in an anonymous tab, probably only available in US, tested in android and desktop from Brazil. Scott Scrivens Interesting. I'm in the UK and it works for me. Maybe not everywhere though. Sorry to get your hopes up. You are signed into Google right? Rafael Reinoldes I am logged into google, mainly, because I get a lot of value by syncing stuff across different computers. Scott Scrivens That's annoying, not sure why it wouldn't work in Brazil :( Nathan Type "add reminder" in the Chrome address box. I do it all the time on my PC because it is faster than picking up my phone, but I was also experiencing problems with notifications for reminders set in Chrome not appearing on any of my devices. Now I know why. Rodrigo Chiong It's true that the reminders situation a mess. But I do see a launcher shortcut to add reminders from Inbox that work alright. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dc3b51117bfc2b134dc2fdf28b442f4389a3730166e304ee5ae2969fbe776d83.png Scott Scrivens This is true, and it does work pretty well. The only issue is that, as others have pointed out, Inbox reminder notifications seem to disappear after a little while. I like to leave my reminder notifications in the shade until I get to them. Rodrigo Chiong Well that's also true. You never know if the notification will come from Calendar, Keep, Inbox or the Google app and they all behave differently (particularly the snooze feature) KB You don't need "add reminder" in the search box, just typing "reminder" is sufficient. Dan While adding a reminder in chrome only allows times in 30 minute increments, there is a workaround for at least this part: include the specific time (and optionally the actual reminder text itself) in your 'add reminder' search: 'add reminder 7:40pm' will pre-fill the time for you (although changing the time will still only allow the 30 minute incremented time values) or just search the entire reminder: 'add reminder take out the trash at 7:40pm' or 'remind me to take out the trash at 7:40pm' hopefully this helps someone else Scott Scrivens Great find. As a way of crowdsourcing fixes this is proving very worthwhile. Chris Sanner lessee....what else about reminders bugs me - 1) if you want to dismiss a recurring notification early one dya your only option is to dismiss it *forever* 2) no "repeat x time after completion" option. this is the thing that most keeps me on other todo apps. I might not replace my furnace filter ON THE DAY it's due - but I want to be reminded again a month after I *DO* replace and dismiss it. Joe Dink AMEN! So true! It's pathetic. On such a good platform, otherwise. Chris I agree the reminder system has some shortcomings. I was frustrated recently when the assistant had all but removed entering a reminder by typing if you're in a situation where you can't use your voice. So, I wrote this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwilcox.quickreminders Its shortcuts to create Google reminders. I depend on reminders, as well Scott Scrivens That looks really useful. Incompatible with my 5X though sadly... Chris Not compatible with the 5X? I'll look into that asap and fix that... Scott Scrivens Let me know when you do, I'll give it a whirl. Chris What country are you in? Are you in the US? Currently, I have the Play Store distribution set to US only for compatibility with Google's app service Scott Scrivens Ah, that's why...I'm in the UK. Are you able to expand the distribution to here? Chris I've enabled the UK and Canada along with the US. Let me know if it works! It may have quirks but lets see! Scott Scrivens Just had a quick play with it, it's really cool! Things I would change/add (if you care to hear them): 1. Blue instead of green (I just hate lime green personally, it reminds me of too much of pre-Holo Android). Add a custom themer even if that's not loads of work. 2. Simple "Add reminder" option, without a predefined time. 3. Hitting X should close app altogether rather than just minimise. Add settings to the top of the expanded options rather than floating at the bottom. 4. Move "Remove ads option" further up out of the way. It's too prominent. 5. Key not available in my country, so add UK and Canada to that too! Those are just my two-pence, though I realise it's all subjective :) Chris Thank you for the feedback! I began building a theme option to set different colors. Many people would probably like that. I'll be happy to credit you on the app page when I post the next update. F4LL0U7 I recently got Android Wear 2.0 on my GWR, and noticed that I don't even receive reminders on there anymore! I set all my reminders through Google Now, and last night I got a monthly reminder at 9pm on my phone. Nothing at all showed up on my watch. I navigated to the Reminders app on my watch, and the recurring reminder was in the list, but it showed zero current reminders. WTF! Seems like this might be a leftover bug from AW 1.x, where I would receive reminders right on time on my watch, but they were not actionable. If I tried marking one as done, it would think for a few seconds, and then I'd get the frowning cloud icon saying I wasn't connected. But I WAS connected, damn you Google! Josh A The app shortcuts u said Google should add on the home screen can be added to the home screen by holding on the icon again. For example, look at the pic added https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae1ec39a9aa7517f5e7184c8e8332418e71499a85ea1c56450445ad292f0ba61.png Scott Scrivens What I said is that the Google app should implement similar app shortcuts. Patrick O’Hara To me, the issue isn't getting reminders into the device. The issue is that there is only 1 type of reminder and it's easy to miss. There should be multiple reminder types. Silent, visual, audible, and urgent, for example. I've set lots of reminders that I never got because my volume was turned down. myssi GIVE ME REMINDER WITH DURATION!! Trip66 To find all your reminders all you have to do is say Okay Google show me my reminders and scroll the list the most recent ones are usually on top I've never had any problems finding them. Devin Quesenberry Scott, hang in there pal. You're not alone in your struggle. I've been trying to find a digital solution for my non-scheduling mind since the Trapper Keeper days. Some days I still have to carry around pen and paper, but I'm grateful for google reminders nonetheless. When Inbox came out I signed up because I liked the idea of merging my to-do list with my email (I wish Google would capitalize on this more, but it seems to me that they are starting to take the shotgun approach to development in general). However, I still find myself needing other apps like Keep and Onenote to get the job done. Reminders help me compartmentalize the many hats I have to wear between work, home, and volunteer life, so DO NOT APOLOGIZE for having reminders to do basic things like charge your phone, use the bathroom, or bathe every once in awhile. I even have reminders to check in on my mom from time to time (i.e. reminders to be a decent human being). Loved this article. Fong Yang I'm also a heavy user of reminders and I see the same problems. I hope Google fixes this soon. bekifft You're not alone, I would have written almost exactly this article if I could find the words. I've come to most of the same conclusions you have. Keep is by far the best way to handle reminders through Google, as it's the only one that lets you specify an arbitrary location at which to be reminded. The reason reminders haven't been added to Google Home yet is likely precisely because of this mess. God only knows what it looks like on the back end. Andrey Balandin You're very right in pointing out these deficiencies and I totally support that the experience is inconsistent. However, to be fair you are not using the right view in the calendar for your purposes. There is value in having one app which can show you all of the reminders created by all different methods together with other events and calendar is a good place for this, isn't it? To avoid this cluttered look which makes the calendar unusable you should just switch to schedule view. Scott Scrivens But the month view is how I use Calendar. I like to have an overview of my activity for the whole month. I don't think I should have to change my behaviour because Google is unwilling to hide upcoming recurring tasks in Calendar. YuCMi You forget that Google's business strategy is to have clones of each of their products. Rob It's worth adding that you can only add a reminder using the Google app if you have Google Now cards activated (I don't, because I find it otherwise useless).

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 39 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%. Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs and an increase in volume. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's coming earnings release drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement.

I'll update the post with the new numbers now that markets are open (and I am awake.) charlie Jason Interesting. Hopefully this will allow them to hire some competent designers to slim down the iBezels and competent supply managers keep their phones in stock. Max Johnson They could relocate some of the employees who currently are making new messaging apps. But in seriousness looks like they're working on that already. charlie Jason Really? Maybe bezel-less is too hard, but I definitely hope for reasonably slim bezels or at least front facing speakers for Pixel 2. Suicide_Note Maybe Alphabet can also spare a few bucks to hire someone competent to make your comments witty, insightful, original, and/or funny? charlie Jason Butthurt Pixel fanboy much? Aaron The iBezel part was lame, bro. But to your defense, whomever is responsible for the Pixels must have skipped the section on supply and demand in high school economics. Suicide_Note Don't know why you would make that assumption, considering i said nothing about the Pixel, not did i express any offense about his comment. Perhaps you should prob Alphabet for a loan too, as it seems you could use some help with your reading comprehension. Fitzgerald42 Now that was clever ddevito Funny you should say that. David Foster, who ran the entire Pixel Division, just left to go back to Amazon. JD Thank goodness George yeah, those designers went to the Allo Sticker team~ charlie Jason LOL shots fired! diese does this mean we will get more messenger and sticker packs??

TheManuz Damn, I had forgotten that line! ArunRock You got me at Umbrella Corporation dhamp2g To celebrate our earnings we are going to add a new money themed sticker pack. ...and add the pixel to the End of Life list.... Defenestratus Time to start looking at breaking up Google, Apple and Facebook. abc No way. It's America. I say Google, Apple and Facebook should merge into one monopolistic behemoth. Then we can hear the most capitalist country on earth whine about the lack of competition. ddevito Is there any mention of how much revenue mobile advertising produced? Because that's the number that counts. Until Google/Alphabet/whateverthehelltheycallthemselves figures out a reliable way to grow revenue on mobile this is all smoke and mirrors, which is what the whole Alphabet fiasco was about TheScientists I thought I had read a story a few months back that mobile ad revenue had already surpassed desktop. Yep, here you go: https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Moves-Majority-Share-of-Googles-Worldwide-Ad-Revenues/1014633 Ryne Hager Yeah, I would have loved to see advertising actually divided up in the quarter's revenue reports. Some other marketing firms have put together their own estimates showing that mobile is accounting for most of it now. But, without details about revenue from mobile sites vs apps, etc., those third party estimates still don't tell much. I wish Google would be transparent about that. Aaron Really does look like since they're doing this good they could have chosen a better ODM for the Pixels. Either HTC sucks at manufacturing or Google has another issue entirely. No excuse for the Pixel to still be out of stock. Daan Smit Google doesn't care about you having a Pixel or not. You're not the customer; you're their (personal)-data-generating-life-stock. They want to collect your data from any Android device you can use. Pixes is just one of them and therefore not a focus point. Google's customers are enterprises buying target-advert content based on your personal data gathered. That's where their focus is and hence the profit. destinyhud well google care about pixel now that they are making profit for them as well. Klark Kenneth Those pesky taxes! Come on Trump, hurry up and get rid of corporate taxes so the rest of us can share the burden, Google needs a new pair of shoes!! jcopernicus "They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. " The intimation that cutting back is an action to increase revenue is so hilarious. Cut backs are made to stop losses, not to stimulate growth. Defenestratus Indeed, and there is only so much cutting back you can do. Ryne Hager I was just surprised. With the projects that did get cut this year I assumed at some level there had to be losses going on, but they still exceeded estimates. Even the moonshots (at least, as a whole), which includes Fiber, were able to keep things profitable with the layoffs and cuts there. I had an expectation at some level that those cut-backs were a negative indicator, and that ended up being entirely incorrect. TechGuy22 so much money and yet google can't get their shit together Doby Gillis Gee, if only they listened to you, I'm sure they'd do so much better. /s abc Well, even a 5 year old could come up with a better messaging app. Although five year olds probably love stickers too!

The debate prompted an unusual amount of misleading unrest. Understanding what’s really at stake requires a deeper exploration of this issue to dispel myths and recognize realities. There is a common misconception Congress stripped Americans of their privacy rights. In reality, consumers have the same rights today as before the vote. The joint resolution repealed an FCC order that was not scheduled to take effect until later this year. By repealing these rules, Congress preserved the status quo, and consumers should see no difference because the law today is the same as it has been since at least 2015. The purpose of repeal is to restore a level playing field among digital advertisers. Internet-based companies, such as Google and Facebook, are subject to Federal Trade Commission regulation, which requires companies to notify consumers regarding what information is collected and how it is used and to allow them to “opt out” of such collection efforts. These rules also governed broadband providers until 2015, when the FCC inadvertently stripped the FTC of jurisdiction when it reclassified them as common carriers. The FCC could have corrected this error by simply applying the FTC rules to broadband providers. But it instead applied a stricter opt-in rule, which prohibited broadband providers from using consumer data unless the consumer gives explicit permission. Importantly, under both regimes, consumers ultimately control how their data is used. The only difference is the default rule. The FTC allows Google to use your data unless you say no, while the FCC would have allowed Verizon to use your data only if you say yes. This is a trivial distinction for consumers — but it would have given Google a tremendous advantage in the battle for Internet advertising dollars, a market Google already dominates. Additionally, it is a common misunderstanding that broadband providers know more about you than companies like Google or Facebook. Broadband providers can’t really “see” all traffic. They only gather information on one’s activities at home, while Google can capture data anywhere a person is logged into a Google account or using a Google operating system. And Google and Facebook, which collect an estimated two of every three digital advertising dollars, can capture content, while broadband providers generally only see metadata and traffic-flow information.

Consumers uncomfortable with the monetization of their information still have options. All major broadband providers have privacy policies that allow consumers to opt out of data collection. Consumers also can use a virtual private network to shield their activities online, though be aware the most reliable VPN providers are not free. Ultimately, privacy questions cannot be debated in a vacuum. Consumer information is the lifeblood of the Internet. Our information is routinely collected by many companies, but this is not necessarily problematic. Monetization of consumer data is what helps make Gmail, Facebook, YouTube and other services free — and might someday bring broadband prices down. We cannot debate the value of potential future privacy rules without considering the consequences such rules might have on the broader Internet ecosystem.

Google Pixel, Pixel XL smartphones are widely acknowledged as one of the best Android cameras on a smartphones. The credit for this is given to the software part from Google’s end, especially the HDR+ mode, that allows for some stunning photographs, even when the lighting might not always be ideal. But how far can one push a smartphone camera? Can we expect results like the ones in a high-end DSLR, or even close to it, when the lighting is bad? Well one of Google’s engineers did some experiments with the Pixel and Nexus 6P camera at nighttime to showcase exactly what is possible with a smartphone. The results looks stunning, given these are photos taken from smartphones. Google software engineer Florian Kainz, who is part of the Daydream team, has posted about his experiment on a blog for the company. The results posted by Florian show just how much smartphone photography can be improved with software tweaks, and how long it has to go, before this kind of imagery becomes common on all phones. In smartphones, low-light photography is still an issue and very often pictures turn out to be grainy, there’s too much noise, and the object might not look sharp. However as Kainz explains in the blogpost, he decided to write a new Android camera app where he could control the exposure, ISO and focus distance. The app shoots up to 64 RAW frames with the settings, and one can later process them on a PC, explains Kainz. As he argues, the individuals frames by themselves are very grainy, but when processed together resulted in some stunning images. Kainz has shared quite a few samples of his nighttime experiments with low-light photography. He admits the resolution of the images might not be as high as the ones people will get from a DSLR, but the pictures are “sharp all the way into the corners, there is not much visible noise.” Check out the sample pictures below.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock Android P will probably be the last major software update your Pixel receives Chris Smith @chris_writes April 28th, 2017 at 8:51 AM Share Tweet One “problem” with Android smartphones is that they don’t receive major software updates forever. The Pixel is no different, and no matter how happy you might be with Google’s new phone you should know it won’t always receive the latest Android releases. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 Released last fall running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, the Pixel phones will get Android O later this year, and they’ll be eligible for the Android P upgrade that should follow in 2018. But come October of next year, they might not get any other Android updates. When it comes to security updates, you get one extra year of coverage — that means Google will still push out security patches until October 2019. That’s hardly a surprise, considering that Google made this update policy official a while ago. But, as Android Police notes, Google just updated the end-of-life information for the Pixel phones listing these deadlines, as seen in the screenshot below. There’s always a chance for Google to keep upgrading the Pixel phones even after they reach their end-of-life. Even still, considering the new doc that was just published, you probably shouldn’t get your hopes up. Image Source: Android Police Google says it can guarantee Android version updates for two years, while security patch updates are guaranteed for at least three years after the device was first sold on the Google Play store, or at least 18 months from when the store last sold the phone, whichever is longer. Android O is already available for the Pixel and Pixel XL as a beta version and should roll out at some point this fall, right around the time Google will launch its Pixel 2 handsets.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  Google Octane Web Browser Benchmark Retired Google Octane Web Browser Benchmark Retired Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Fri, Apr 28, 2017 - 8:38 AM Google has retired and is no longer maintaining the Octane benchmarkOctane benchmark that measures a JavaScripts engine’s performance by running a suite of tests representative of certain use cases in JavaScript applications. Google first came out with Octane in 2012 and it became one of the most recommended benchmarks to run by the browser community. Google noted that by 2015 most JavaScript implementations had done compiler optimizations to get high scores in Octane and that the benchmark scores seen in Octane didn’t really translate that well into the performance one would get on real web pages. In fact, some of the optimizations made for higher Octane scores actually hurt performance on real-world websites. So, Google Octane is being put out to pasture just like SunSpider was years ago because the developers felt the industry over-optimized for them and the results no longer lined up with the performance one would get when surfing the web. Google did not say that Octane was being removed from their site, but if you are worried about that happening you should fork it on GitHubfork it on GitHub and use a local copy to run it. Legit Reviews uses Octane in our CPU benchmarks, so we will be finding a replacement for this web browser performance test. Michael Hablich over at the V8 JavaScript Engine team has a great post up about real world performance and noted that he likes a test called Speedometer, a WebKit benchmark that includes applications written in React, Angular, Ember, and other frameworks. He found that performance test had more appropriate runtime call stats than Octane. His testing (shown above) demonstrated that the speedometer test suite had a very similar runtime profile to the 25 sites. Speedometer doesn’t exactly match real web pages, but it clearly does a better job than Octane. It looks like this is the benchmark test that we will be moving over to!

Amazon's cloud division, known as Amazon Web Services, reported $890 million in operating income on revenue $3.66 billion for the first quarter ending in March. That's up a respectable 42.6% over last year. But perhaps more important, as MarketWatch points out, that business comprised 89% of Amazon's total operating income. AWS, previously seen as a loss leader for a giant e-commerce company, has proven itself to be the profit engine. At this rate, AWS (amzn) remains on track to deliver $14 billion in revenue for the year, as Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky pointed out on the company's earnings call. As healthy as that growth rate is, it pales in comparison to past years. In the second quarter of 2015, for example, AWS posted 82% year-over-year growth. But AWS is now growing off a much larger base, and it's facing more capable competitors in Microsoft and Google than it did a few years ago. TBRI analyst Meaghan McGrath also pointed out that price cuts announced in December had an impact. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter For its first quarter, Microsoft (msft) said sales from its "intelligent cloud" business grew 11% to $6.76 billion in the quarter from $6.09 billion a year ago. Profit was up about 2% to $2.18 billion from $2.17 billion year-over-year. This category includes not just AWS rival Microsoft Azure, but also Office 365 and Dynamics 365 subscriptions as well Windows Server and other software that run in customer data centers—not in any cloud at all. Microsoft said Azure revenue alone was up 93% year-over-year, but provided no numbers, which is really what people want to see. "I think Azure overall is growing faster than AWS in percentage terms, from a smaller base, of course," said Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research (forr) via email. "I think a steady doubling of quarterly revenue on a year-over-year basis is terrific growth for Azure. Now I just want to know what the actual Azure number is—we all do." Related: Welcome to the Era of Data Center Consolidation Google (googl), which is something of a wild card here, also continues to push its cloud agenda. But the size of that business remains hazy. Google's parent company, Alphabet, counts cloud in its broad "other" category, which is virtually everything outside Internet search and advertising sales. That category this year contributed $3 billion in revenue, up a healthy 50% compared to a year ago. That would put "other" revenue, which also includes the company's G Suite business software and hardware like the Pixel phones, at about $12 billion a year. "Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet," company CFO Ruth Porat said during the earnings call on Thursday evening. Alphabet is the parent company of Google. Google senior vice president Diane Greene, who leads this cloud push, said last week she thinks Google's cloud business could surpass AWS in five years. Industry followers are betting neither Microsoft nor Google will break out their true cloud numbers until they're in the same ballpark as a AWS. There is precedent for this: Amazon didn't start breaking out AWS-only numbers until 2015, nine years into its existence.

Sean Da, CEO of YI Technologies Inc. unveiled the new YI HALO VR Camera in partnership with Google (Jump); a 3D – 360 degree professional VR camera capable of shooting in 8K resolution. YI say it’s their most advanced 360 camera to date, which at first glance isn’t so hard to believe. Most 360 cameras have two sensors, front and back, but the YI HALO VR has a total of 17 clock-synchronized action cameras (16 surrounding and 1 up view) which have been created by the same team behind the award winning YI 4K Action Camera and the YI 4K+. It’s an insane design that will probably take the most detailed 360 images we’ve ever seen. YI Halo VR Camera The YI HALO was developed in partnership with Google and was built to work with Jump Assembler, which together can produce high quality stereo VR content in up to 8K x 8K resolution. This is then stitched together by the Google Jump Assembler team. It really sounds like an exciting addition for the VR industry, especially as it’s the first Jump Assembler camera to have an up view camera, meaning you’ll have a more complete field-of-view. Before you get too excited… it might be worth noting that you have to register your interest before you can buy a YI HALO. The registration will need to be overseen by YI and the team at Google before you’re allowed to own one. Even then, the cost is a lot to swallow at $16,999. Here is a sneak peak of YI Halo: https://youtu.be/FAtdv94yzp4 It seems like YI really haven’t missed a thing in the creation of the YI HALO, claiming they’ve used the most advanced technology in every aspect including its passive thermal design allowing it to operate in warm environments, and with each camera built with the advanced low power Ambarella A9SE75 SOC, YI Technology states that it can work in temperatures up to 95ºF, without overheating, that’s hot! VR filmmakers can stay in full control with the LCD control screen and an accompanying app, available on Android. Full compatibility with Jump’s high-end VR creation platform, gives filmmakers a peace of mind when it comes to the biggest barrier between VR filming and high-quality post-production; the stitching. If any of this sounds remotely familiar that’s because last year GoPro released the Odyssey, a 16 camera rig also built for Google’s Jump. Like the GoPro Odyssey the YI HALO can shoot in 8K resolution, though the up-view camera and its ability to shoot 5.8K at 60fps is what sets it apart. YI are proving to be a real problem for GoPro as last month they also released the YI 4K+, which is the first action camera that can shoot in 4K at 60fps, a feature that GoPro fans have been eager for since the HERO 4. YI 360 VR Camera In typical YI fashion, they wanted to please everyone, which is why they also announced a new high-end (and relatively low-priced) 360 camera named YI 360 VR. YI came prepared to NAB with a full list of specs on the YI 360 VR camera, which includes dual 220 degree lenses and two SONY IMX377 image sensors. Its Ambarella H2V95 SOC can process the high quality 5.7K videos, into the most vivid images.  It’s priced at $399 and will be available to purchase in June (2017).

They soon quickly figured out it was a Google Analytics bug in how it was capturing AMP pages. The reports began coming in yesterday morning on Twitter, Reddit, WebmasterWorld and more and more places. Google's Paul Bakaus from the AMP team quickly responded to the issue saying they are working on a fix: @brentwilson85 @fighto @rBigSEO @FrankieVSEO @badams @jeffreypreston We're on it. Forwarded to Google Search and Analytics teams. Definitely not intended, update coming soon.— Paul Bakaus (@pbakaus) April 27, 2017 Then by 2:30pm or so yesterday, Google fixed the issue: Update: The issue has been confirmed and a fix is being rolled out. You should see things returning to normal. https://t.co/JiGYqvl1ed— AMP Project (@AMPhtml) April 27, 2017 It seems the fix would only be a retroactive fix but it is fixed going forward. Here is a chart from one who was impacted showing the AMP page traffic returning after the bug was fixed: @rustybrick Hello Barry, amp traffic it back.... after 18 hours of backout.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google Mobile Results Tests Dropping AMP Results Completely? Google Mobile Results Tests Dropping AMP Results Completely? Apr 28, 2017 • 7:54 am | (7) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Earlier this week, we reported that Google was potentially testing dropping the AMP logo from AMP powered mobile pages in the mobile Google search results. Well, since then, I've been seeing random reports of Google not just dropping the logo, but also not linking to the AMP page, when it is both available, properly canonicalized and linking all correctly. Watch this video of it in action from Sergey: I see pages that have AMP opening without AMP now (not just the icon dropped in this case). test or bug? cc: @rustybrick @JohnMu @jenstar pic.twitter.com/mmzqFhsoKN— Sergey Alakov (@sergey_alakov) April 27, 2017 This is the same result, in a different browser, which kind of implies a bucket test on the other one, showing AMP working properly in the mobile results: .@rustybrick @JohnMu @jenstar here is the same page with AMP pic.twitter.com/QvbukK62OU— Sergey Alakov (@sergey_alakov) April 27, 2017 The SEO tool RankRanger also spotted this after I covered it originally and told me it was more than just the logo drop too. They posted on Twitter that "Google is showing less AMP results," adding that even when it "appears at times to show non-AMP version of certain pages despite availability." They then shared their tool showing a significant drop in AMP pages showing up: RankRanger pulled some code from their sample and showed how the AMP canonical is there but Google in this test is not recognizing it: What is interesting is that when I asked Google about it earlier this week, they kind of made me feel like I was off base here. They said "as you know we do tens of thousands of experiments in search every year but there are no such plans at this moment to change anything. The logo tells users that the page they will open will do so reliably and consistently fast." Gary Illyes also: @LWilson1980 Err... No, why?— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) April 25, 2017 Well, something is up. Either it is a bug or a test but something is up. Forum discussion at Twitter.

By Liam Tung | April 28, 2017 -- 12:32 GMT (05:32 PDT) | Topic: Security Chrome 62 will show 'Not secure' warnings for HTTP pages with user input fields and all HTTP pages in incognito mode. Image: Google Google is giving web developers six months to prepare for the next phase of its plan to mark all HTTP pages as 'Not secure'. October will mark stage two of Google's plan to label all HTTP pages as 'Not secure' in Chrome. In January, Google started to label some pages in HTTP as non-secure with the release of Chrome 56. This phase affected pages that transmit sensitive information such as login and payment-card data on the web. The not-secure label indicated that data is being exchanged on an unencrypted connection. HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, offers better protection against someone on the same network viewing or modifying the traffic, in what is known as a man-in-the-middle attack. Beginning in October, Chrome will label HTTP pages as insecure if users can input any data. Google highlights this will apply to any page with a search box. "Any type of data that users type into websites should not be accessible to others on the network, so starting in version 62 Chrome will show the 'Not secure' warning when users type data into HTTP sites," said Emily Schechter, a Chrome Security Team product manager. The expanded warnings for HTTP pages will are likely to add pressure on site owners to acquire the necessary SSL/TLS certificates and setup HTTPS on their web servers. Also, warnings for any user-input field cast a wider net than login and payment pages, given the frequency of pages with a search box. Site owners have about six months from now to enable HTTPS with Chrome 62 due for stable release on October 24. Firefox maker Mozilla hasn't yet said whether it will follow Chrome's new user input warnings, but it also began displaying 'in-context' warnings for payment and login pages in January. One site owner discovered the consequences of not enabling HTTPS on payment and login pages in March, and, amusingly, filed a bug report to Mozilla requesting the warnings be removed. Chrome 62 will also introduce warnings for all HTTP pages when the user selects Chrome's Incognito mode. "When users browse Chrome with Incognito mode, they likely have increased expectations of privacy. However, HTTP browsing is not private to others on the network, so in version 62 Chrome will also warn users when visiting an HTTP page in Incognito mode," said Schechter Google hasn't said how or when it will expand non-secure warnings to more HTTP pages but it will eventually label all HTTP pages insecure. When that happens, it will display 'Not secure' in red, which is today only used for broken HTTPS. The other reason Google is dragging the web towards HTTPS is to support its push for developers to adopt progressive web apps through JavaScript 'service workers'. These sit between the browser and network to enable offline and background syncing features and require HTTPS to be enabled. According to Google's HTTP Transparency Report, over half of all pages are viewed over HTTPS on the desktop. For Chrome OS, 71 percent of pages are loaded over HTTPS, while 58 percent are for Chrome on Windows. While it is becoming more common for sites to enable HTTPS, dozens of the world's most popular sites still have not.

However, nothing last forever. Even Pixel devices will stop getting updates someday. When exactly will that be? Google released a handy chart. According to a new support page, Google has announced when Pixel and Nexus devices will stop receiving security and version updates. Essentially, phones will continue to receive security updates for one year after they stop receiving version updates. Here’s what that looks like for the Pixel and Pixel XL. Phone No guaranteed Android version updates after No guaranteed security updates after Pixel XL October 2018 October 2019 Pixel October 2018 October 2019 Google also updated the chart for old Nexus devices. The Nexus 7, Nexus 10, Nexus 4, and Nexus 5 have already reached end of life. Here’s the schedule for the remaining Nexus devices.

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 39 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%. Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs and an increase in volume. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's coming earnings release drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement. Alternate title: Google's umbrella can't keep things dry when it's raining money. Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%.

Especially as competitors like FB are taking up more of the ad pie. 😆😄 I know you read 9to5G also... today there was an article that quotes the head of Google Cloud Platform saying they will surpass Amazon in 2022. Will that do it for you? Roger Siegenthaler and you believe them? ddevito No they won't. Enterprises don't trust Google abc Surpass Amazon in what? Amazon's cloud powers many of the internet's most popular sites. If the head of Google Cloud genuinely believes that he will beat them by 2022, then he's a moron. You obviously are a fanboy, which you makes you a moron by definition. Suicide_Note Which is why they have other projects and endeavors aside from search.

I'll update the post with the new numbers now that markets are open (and I am awake.) charlie Jason Interesting. Hopefully this will allow them to hire some competent designers to slim down the iBezels and competent supply managers keep their phones in stock. Max Johnson They could relocate some of the employees who currently are making new messaging apps. But in seriousness looks like they're working on that already. charlie Jason Really? Maybe bezel-less is too hard, but I definitely hope for reasonably slim bezels or at least front facing speakers for Pixel 2. Suicide_Note Maybe Alphabet can also spare a few bucks to hire someone competent to make your comments witty, insightful, original, and/or funny? charlie Jason Butthurt Pixel fanboy much? Aaron The iBezel part was lame, bro. But to your defense, whomever is responsible for the Pixels must have skipped the section on supply and demand in high school economics. Suicide_Note Don't know why you would make that assumption, considering i said nothing about the Pixel, not did i express any offense about his comment. Perhaps you should prob Alphabet for a loan too, as it seems you could use some help with your reading comprehension. Fitzgerald42 Now that was clever ddevito Funny you should say that. David Foster, who ran the entire Pixel Division, just left to go back to Amazon.

TheManuz Damn, I had forgotten that line! ArunRock You got me at Umbrella Corporation dhamp2g To celebrate our earnings we are going to add a new money themed sticker pack. ...and add the pixel to the End of Life list.... Defenestratus Time to start looking at breaking up Google, Apple and Facebook. abc No way. It's America. I say Google, Apple and Facebook should merge into one monopolistic behemoth. Then we can hear the most capitalist country on earth whine about the lack of competition. ddevito Is there any mention of how much revenue mobile advertising produced? Because that's the number that counts. Until Google/Alphabet/whateverthehelltheycallthemselves figures out a reliable way to grow revenue on mobile this is all smoke and mirrors, which is what the whole Alphabet fiasco was about TheScientists I thought I had read a story a few months back that mobile ad revenue had already surpassed desktop. Yep, here you go: https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Moves-Majority-Share-of-Googles-Worldwide-Ad-Revenues/1014633 Ryne Hager Yeah, I would have loved to see advertising actually divided up in the quarter's revenue reports. Some other marketing firms have put together their own estimates showing that mobile is accounting for most of it now. But, without details about revenue from mobile sites vs apps, etc., those third party estimates still don't tell much. I wish Google would be transparent about that. Aaron Really does look like since they're doing this good they could have chosen a better ODM for the Pixels. Either HTC sucks at manufacturing or Google has another issue entirely. No excuse for the Pixel to still be out of stock. Daan Smit Google doesn't care about you having a Pixel or not. You're not the customer; you're their (personal)-data-generating-life-stock. They want to collect your data from any Android device you can use. Pixes is just one of them and therefore not a focus point. Google's customers are enterprises buying target-advert content based on your personal data gathered. That's where their focus is and hence the profit. destinyhud well google care about pixel now that they are making profit for them as well. Klark Kenneth Those pesky taxes! Come on Trump, hurry up and get rid of corporate taxes so the rest of us can share the burden, Google needs a new pair of shoes!! jcopernicus "They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. " The intimation that cutting back is an action to increase revenue is so hilarious. Cut backs are made to stop losses, not to stimulate growth. Defenestratus Indeed, and there is only so much cutting back you can do. Ryne Hager I was just surprised. With the projects that did get cut this year I assumed at some level there had to be losses going on, but they still exceeded estimates. Even the moonshots (at least, as a whole), which includes Fiber, were able to keep things profitable with the layoffs and cuts there. I had an expectation at some level that those cut-backs were a negative indicator, and that ended up being entirely incorrect. TechGuy22 so much money and yet google can't get their shit together Doby Gillis Gee, if only they listened to you, I'm sure they'd do so much better. /s abc Well, even a 5 year old could come up with a better messaging app. Although five year olds probably love stickers too!

Last month it was revealed that two major tech companies were tricked by a Lithuanian man into sending him $100million each as part of a scheme in which he impersonated a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer. The tech companies involved weren't named at the time. Evaldas Rimasauskas was arrested this month in Lithuania at the request of US authorities and is currently in jail on wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft charges. Evaldas Rimasauskas was arrested this month in Lithuania at the request of US authorities and is currently in jail on wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft charges after after allegedly conning Facebook and Google out of $100million each Rimasauskas' alleged scheme involved sending emails to employees of the tech giants asking them to wire money that they actually owed to the Asian hardware vendor to the accounts of companies in Latvia and Cyprus that carried the name Quanta. In order to conceal his fraud from banks that handled the transfers, Rimasaukas forged invoices, contracts and letters purportedly signed by executives of the two victim companies, according to prosecutors. An investigation by Fortune published on Thursday revealed that the two major tech companies affected were Google and Facebook, who both paid out more than $100million.

Share this article Share 32 shares A Facebook spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.' Google, too, said it had 'detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved'. In a statement last month to Reuters, Quanta spokeswoman Carol Hu said the company had been 'impersonated' as part of the fraud. 'Quanta did not suffer from any financial harm from this incident,' she added, calling the matter 'unfortunate'. Rimasauskas' alleged scheme involved sending emails to employees of Google and Facebook asking them to wire money that they actually owed to the Asian hardware vendor to the accounts of companies in Latvia and Cyprus that carried the name Quanta Quanta, with a market capitalization of $8.4 billion, is a supplier of servers and other hardware to major technology companies. It is part of the Open Compute Project, an initiative launched by Facebook Inc to share server design technology. In 2011 Amazon.com Inc outsourced the assembly of its Kindle Fire tablet to Quanta. Rimasauskas, through his lawyer, confirmed he was the owner of a Latvian company with the same name as Quanta from 2013 to 2016, the time frame in which the fraud occurred, according to the indictment. 'Rimasauskas did buy the Latvian company, because he was going to develop a business,' the lawyer, Linas Kuprusevicius, told Reuters in an email. Rimasauskas strongly contests the charges presented by US authorities, the lawyer said. He has a construction engineering degree and was working at a construction business in Lithuania prior to his arrest, he said. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said last year that US and foreign victims had made 22,143 complaints since October 2013 about so-called business email compromise scams involving requests for more than $3 billion in transfers. A US extradition request for Rimasauskas is expected by late May, Lithuanian prosecutors told Reuters. He is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, which each carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and identity theft, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years. Despite falling for the fraud, and an advertiser boycott of its video platform YouTube, Google has raked in huge profits this year. The internet giant's parent company Alphabet boasted a 'terrific start' to 2017 despite more than 250 companies pulling adverts from its video sharing site. Sales leapt 22% to £19.1 billion in the first three months of the year, compared to the same period the year before, while advertising sales climbed 19% to £16.6 billion. YouTube faced a torrent of criticism earlier this year after brands found their adverts were being shown alongside jihadist, white supremacist and rape apologist videos.  BT, Waitrose, Cancer Research UK, the Co-Op Group and Mercedes Benz were just a few of the firms that joined the boycott. Alphabet's profits also climbed this year, reaching £4.1 billion, compared to £3.2 billion last year.

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 39 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%. Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs and an increase in volume. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's coming earnings release drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement.

Especially as competitors like FB are taking up more of the ad pie. 😆😄 I know you read 9to5G also... today there was an article that quotes the head of Google Cloud Platform saying they will surpass Amazon in 2022. Will that do it for you? Roger Siegenthaler and you believe them? ddevito No they won't. Enterprises don't trust Google abc Surpass Amazon in what? Amazon's cloud powers many of the internet's most popular sites. If the head of Google Cloud genuinely believes that he will beat them by 2022, then he's a moron. You obviously are a fanboy, which you makes you a moron by definition. Suicide_Note Which is why they have other projects and endeavors aside from search. Do you really think that the people who run and advise Google haven't thought about this? destinyhud cloud and hardware is the next big thing for google. cloud(yearly) and hardware(quaterly) is already a billion dollar business for google. they need time to become huge Lateef Alabi-Oki Google be like... https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lFvtuqmey9QTAY/giphy.gif Dirty Dave man i miss wearing jeans that were way to big Lateef Alabi-Oki I still won't rock skinny jeans. blahmoomoo The stock price is actually up around 4% after hours.

I'll update the post with the new numbers now that markets are open (and I am awake.) charlie Jason Interesting. Hopefully this will allow them to hire some competent designers to slim down the iBezels and competent supply managers keep their phones in stock. Max Johnson They could relocate some of the employees who currently are making new messaging apps. But in seriousness looks like they're working on that already. charlie Jason Really? Maybe bezel-less is too hard, but I definitely hope for reasonably slim bezels or at least front facing speakers for Pixel 2. Suicide_Note Maybe Alphabet can also spare a few bucks to hire someone competent to make your comments witty, insightful, original, and/or funny? charlie Jason Butthurt Pixel fanboy much? Aaron The iBezel part was lame, bro. But to your defense, whomever is responsible for the Pixels must have skipped the section on supply and demand in high school economics. Suicide_Note Don't know why you would make that assumption, considering i said nothing about the Pixel, not did i express any offense about his comment. Perhaps you should prob Alphabet for a loan too, as it seems you could use some help with your reading comprehension. Fitzgerald42 Now that was clever ddevito Funny you should say that. David Foster, who ran the entire Pixel Division, just left to go back to Amazon. JD Thank goodness George yeah, those designers went to the Allo Sticker team~ charlie Jason LOL shots fired! diese does this mean we will get more messenger and sticker packs?? TheManuz I stopped when I read "our favorite UMBRELLA CORPORATION" Now i know where all their AI experimentation is aimed to! Ryne Hager Don't be a hard dog to keep under the porch, Manuz. TheManuz Damn, I had forgotten that line! ArunRock You got me at Umbrella Corporation dhamp2g To celebrate our earnings we are going to add a new money themed sticker pack. ...and add the pixel to the End of Life list.... Defenestratus Time to start looking at breaking up Google, Apple and Facebook. abc No way. It's America. I say Google, Apple and Facebook should merge into one monopolistic behemoth. Then we can hear the most capitalist country on earth whine about the lack of competition. ddevito Is there any mention of how much revenue mobile advertising produced? Because that's the number that counts. Until Google/Alphabet/whateverthehelltheycallthemselves figures out a reliable way to grow revenue on mobile this is all smoke and mirrors, which is what the whole Alphabet fiasco was about TheScientists I thought I had read a story a few months back that mobile ad revenue had already surpassed desktop. Yep, here you go: https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Moves-Majority-Share-of-Googles-Worldwide-Ad-Revenues/1014633 Ryne Hager Yeah, I would have loved to see advertising actually divided up in the quarter's revenue reports. Some other marketing firms have put together their own estimates showing that mobile is accounting for most of it now. But, without details about revenue from mobile sites vs apps, etc., those third party estimates still don't tell much. I wish Google would be transparent about that. Aaron Really does look like since they're doing this good they could have chosen a better ODM for the Pixels. Either HTC sucks at manufacturing or Google has another issue entirely. No excuse for the Pixel to still be out of stock. Daan Smit Google doesn't care about you having a Pixel or not. You're not the customer; you're their (personal)-data-generating-life-stock. They want to collect your data from any Android device you can use. Pixes is just one of them and therefore not a focus point. Google's customers are enterprises buying target-advert content based on your personal data gathered. That's where their focus is and hence the profit. destinyhud well google care about pixel now that they are making profit for them as well. Klark Kenneth Those pesky taxes! Come on Trump, hurry up and get rid of corporate taxes so the rest of us can share the burden, Google needs a new pair of shoes!! jcopernicus "They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. " The intimation that cutting back is an action to increase revenue is so hilarious. Cut backs are made to stop losses, not to stimulate growth. Defenestratus Indeed, and there is only so much cutting back you can do. Ryne Hager I was just surprised. With the projects that did get cut this year I assumed at some level there had to be losses going on, but they still exceeded estimates. Even the moonshots (at least, as a whole), which includes Fiber, were able to keep things profitable with the layoffs and cuts there. I had an expectation at some level that those cut-backs were a negative indicator, and that ended up being entirely incorrect. TechGuy22 so much money and yet google can't get their shit together Doby Gillis Gee, if only they listened to you, I'm sure they'd do so much better. /s abc Well, even a 5 year old could come up with a better messaging app. Although five year olds probably love stickers too!

Through this initiative, Google aims to expand and energise the startup ecosystem in these 11 tier II cities and inspire the budding entrepreneurs to solve for India and its underserved user needs. The internet today provides an opportunity to everyone to pursue their passion and create solutions to solve for the real problems of India. The program will provide a platform for developers and entrepreneurs in tier II cities to hear from experts and learn about the latest Google technologies and get access to direct mentoring and support from Google. Entrepreneurs will get an opportunity to learn directly from Google engineers who will share product usage insights, how to develop mobile first solutions with strong offline and language capabilities and help them build solutions across areas like agri-tech, healthcare, transportation, education, sanitation and more. "Majority of India's Internet users are Indian language users and over 80 percent of them access the Internet from their mobile phones. However, the current Indian startup ecosystem is building products for English speaking audience and caters only to 15 percent of the population," said Karthik Padmanabhan, Program Manager Lead for Google India. "Through this initiative we want to bring the best of Google under one program and join forces with them to help create solutions that serve the needs of a billion Indians," he added. Developers and entrepreneurs will gain from a variety of Google's programs starting with the Google Launchpad mentoring program which will help them to build, scale and accelerate product ideas into category leaders. Launchpad includes a six-month mentorship program covering all aspects of product design, business models, technology support to build for scale and go to market strategies along with USD 50,000 equity free investments. For startups looking to build scalable solutions, Google will provide over USD 20,000 of cloud credits. Developers can also look forward to build on their skills and learn from experts on latest in Android, Firebase, Machine learning, Cloud APIs, progressive web apps and Indian language translation solutions.

Tech Search Search NSASpy Agency Abandons Controversial Surveillance Technique TechHuawei P10 Owners Accuse Company of “Cutting Corners” on Its Flagship Phone TwitterTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey Recently Bought $9.5 million in Company Stock outbrainTaboola and Outbrain Said to be Discussing a Merger Google Google’s Search for Non-Ad Revenue Puts Spotlight on Cloud, Pixel Reuters Apr 28, 2017 Alphabet's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store, has long been sandwiched between Google's advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. Not anymore. The business, categorized as "Other Revenue" in its earnings report, posted a 49.4% jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday—a sum already bigger than Twitter's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13% of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10% a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but it definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook. "(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "We think that is quite an impressive achievement." Alphabet (goog) does not break out revenue contribution within the "Other Revenue" segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category's clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google's cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure. But Google is investing heavily. "In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43% to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93%. "We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38% to nearly $14 billion in 2017," Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. "People are hankering for a really awesome Android phone that basically gives them the iPhone experience," Wang said, adding that the growth in Google's "other revenue" bucket this quarter "shows sustained momentum for the Pixel." Still, the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue comes from ads and that's not going to change any time soon. Total advertising revenue increased 18.8% to $21.1 billion in the first quarter, the company reported on Thursday. Profit also rose 29% to $5.43 billion, beating Wall Street estimates. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Alphabet's drive for diversification also includes its "Other Bets" business, considered the company's loss-making arm. The business, home to the Waymo self-driving car, Google Fiber and thermostat-maker Nest, posted a first-quarter loss of $855 million. Google's shares were up 4% in premarket trading on Friday. They have gained 12.5% this year. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Alphabet’s net income rose to $5.43 billion in the first quarter ended March 31st, up from $4.21 billion a year earlier. Google’s ad revenue, which accounts for a lion’s share of its business, rose 18.8 per cent to $21.41 billion in the first quarter. YouTube found itself at the centre of a scandal a few weeks ago after an investigation found that brand ads were appearing next to content from terrorists and other hateful material. The issue led to brands including Channel 4, Tesco and the UK government pulling ads from the site. However, the controversy seemingly had little impact on Google’s ad business. Speaking on an analyst call following the results announcement, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Google had been on a charm offensive. He claimed chief business officer Philipp Schindler and his team had made “literally thousands and thousands of calls and in-person conversations”. And he credited this with helping it to allay concerns and “respond thoughtfully”. “One of the things I’ve noticed is the depth of relationships we have with our advertisers was very evident to me as we went through this over the past few weeks,” he explained. “I think that deep relationship is what allowed us to respond thoughtfully. And I think the feedback from our partners was very positive and constructive, and I think we are evolving overall to a better place. To me that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships plays well at times like these.” Pichai added that Google works “very hard to create the best environment for brands on YouTube”, highlighting its “cornerstone” offering Google Preferred, which allows brands to advertise against the top 5 per cent of content. Google has also unveiled new safeguards for advertisers, including updated ad policies and enforcement, a new default setting around where ads can appear, improved controls for advertisers and third-party brand safety reporting.

Name: Subject: Message: Sundar Pichai hints ads might be coming to Google Maps soon Newsby Mitja Rutnik18 hours ago 21 810 70 Although Google Maps is one of the company’s most popular services, it definitely isn’t the most profitable one. Speaking to a Wall Street analyst, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai, confirmed the search giant’s plans to start generating more money with Maps. Well, sort of. When asked about the company’s potential plans on this topic, Sundar Pichai mentioned a few things that hint at what we can expect to see in Google Maps in the future. He said that the service has been improved over the last few months, as it now offers a lot more info regarding the things you can do and great places to eat around your location. The CEO sees this as a great option to add more value to users and, as Business Insider reports, a great opportunity to bring in more cash. See also: Google+ adds new Topics feature that will show you targeted content from members 1 day ago It is quite possible that Google Maps will soon show you a bunch of promoted places or maybe even coupons for bars and restaurants around your location or the location you plan on traveling to. This is probably the only way the service can make a significant amount of money and still add some value to its users. This hasn’t exactly been confirmed by Sundar Pichai, but his comments do hint that something like this can be expected in the future. Users probably won’t be too happy about it, but it’s definitely better than displaying irrelevant ads that don’t have any real value.

Pixel and Pixel XL will receive Android updates till October 2018, as per the support page. Meanwhile, security updates are promised to rollout until October 2019. Google had announced Pixel devices in October last year. Google said in its support page, Pixel phones get security updates for at least 3 years from when the device first became available on the Google Store, or at least 18 months from when the Google Store last sold the device, whichever is longer. After that, we can’t guarantee additional updates. Last year in June, Google had revealed details about when each Nexus device will stop receiving Android updates. The support page also states the Nexus 5X and 6P to stop receiving updates after September 2017.
