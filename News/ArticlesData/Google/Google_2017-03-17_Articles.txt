 2 ways to analyze an income statement John Szramiak, Vintage Value Investing Mar. 19, 2017, 1:02 PM 3,503 facebook linkedin twitter email print Flickr via logatfer As an investor, you should be digging in to a company’s financial statements. However, you can’t look at these financials in isolation – it’s important to compare a company’s results to other companies in the selected industry, companies outside of the industry, and against other years to determine whether or not that company might actually be an attractive investment. This causes difficulties, since it’s hard to compare companies of different sizes. For example, if Company A has $3,000,000 of debt outstanding and Company B has $30,000,000 of debt outstanding, is Company A less risky than Company B? We have no way of knowing, because we don’t know the cash positions of Companies A and B, how profitable Companies A and B are, etc. Fortunately, there are two forms of analysis that we can perform that will help us look at income statements and balance sheets of different sizes, so that we can compare apples-to-apples – they are: horizontal analysis and vertical analysis. Both are very easy to understand. Let’s start with horizontal analysis. WHAT IS HORIZONTAL ANALYSIS? Horizontal analysis, also called time series analysis, focuses on trends and changes in numbers over time. Horizontal allows you to detect growth patterns, cyclicality, etc. and to compare these factors among different companies. As an example, let’s take a look at some income statement items for Apple and Google. Vintage Value Investing It’s almost impossible to tell which is growing faster by just looking at the numbers. So we have to do some calculations. We can perform horizontal analysis on the income statement by simply taking the percentage change for each line item year-over-year.  Vintage value Investing By using horizontal analysis, we can now clearly see that Google’s revenue, gross profit, and EBITDA grew faster than Apple’s in every year except for 2015. We can even take this one step further by calculating the compound annual growth rate for each line item from 2012 to 2016 (you can do this in Excel by using the function: =rate(nper, pmt, pv, fv)) – this tells us the average rate the companies grew in each year. Vintage Value Investing Our horizontal analysis (time series analysis) is now officially complete. WHAT IS VERTICAL ANALYSIS? Vertical analysis, also called common-size analysis, focuses on the relative size of different line items so that you can easily compare the income statements and balance sheets of different sized companies. Let’s go back to our income statement items for Apple and Google. Through our horizontal analysis, we know that Google has been growing at a faster and more sustained rate than Apple… but is it a relatively more profitable company? Do both companies profits seem to be sustainable? To perform vertical analysis (common-size analysis), we take each line item and calculate it as a percentage of revenue so that we can come up with “common size” results for both companies. Here are just the numbers once again. I’ve added a line for research & development costs as well. Vintage Value Investing Now, let’s divide each line item by revenue. Vintage Value Investing So what does this tell us? For starters, in 2016, Apple generated $0.39 for every $1 dollar in sales it made. Google did much better, generated $0.61 for every $1 in sales it made. However, Google’s other costs (such as sales, marketing, general & administrative, and R&D) are much higher, since Google’s EBITDA margin was 33.7%, compared to Apple’s 34.0%. We can also look at trends within this vertical analysis. For example, Apple’s gross profit has declined from 43.9% in 2012 to 39.1%, while its R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue have increased from 2.2% to 4.7% over the same time period. This could suggest that Apple is facing tough competitive pressures. Why? Trends in gross margin generally reveal how much pricing power a company has. Because Apple’s gross margin is declining, this probably means that (a) Apple is dropping the price of its products to match lower cost competitors, (b) Apple’s costs to produce its products are increasing and Apple is unable to increase prices to offset this, or (c) a combination of both. This increase in R&D suggests that Apple is doubling down its efforts to create new, innovative products to offset its competition. HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BALANCE SHEET Just like we performed horizontal and vertical analysis on the income statement, we can also run these calculations on the balance sheet (when performing vertical analysis of the balance sheet, line items are usually taken as a percentage of total assets). The process to calculate these ratios is similar to the examples we went through above and are fairly straight forward. However, I’ve found that horizontal and vertical analysis of the balance sheet is much less helpful than on the income statement (ratios and YoY growth rates are basically requirements when analyzing any income statement) and can often be distorted by accounting policies (for example, is a debt-to-equity ratio really useful if the equity number used is simply a result of various accounting choices made over the years?). Rather than calculate a “pure ratio” of the balance sheet, we can instead calculate “mixed ratios” – such as an interest coverage ratio (operating income / interest expense), leverage ratio (debt / EBITDA), or even efficiency ratios like days sales outstanding (DSO) and days payable outstanding (DPO).

Eclipse, which started out as a Sony PlayStation VR game, seems to have gotten a new life on Google’s Daydream platform. A new trailer from its developer White Elk Studios has the full title of the game and the “Only on Daydream” banner included. Eclipse: Edge of Light is set on a sentient planet where you crash land on. You’ll come across an artifact that will let you interact with the ancient technology and elements found there so you can gain powers and discover the secrets of said planet. Unfortunately, there isn’t a release date for the game just yet.

How are districts using Smart School money for tech? Some buy laptops, some security cameras Zachary Matson | March 18, 2017 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE PIN EMAIL Draper Middle School students make a slideshow with their Chromebooks. Sarah Strauss is seen through the center. Photographer: MARC SCHULTZ The routines in 24-year teaching veteran Kim Coelho’s Draper Middle School class may never be the same. “Traditionally, kids would come in and write in a journal. Now they log into Google and their journal entry is waiting for them – the question is right there,” said Coelho, a Mohonasen sixth-grade social studies and English teacher. “You see the journals in the crate over there?” she said pointing to stack of multi-colored notebooks stacked in the back of the room. “They stay there.” Instead, each of her 26 students during a class last week had a laptop on their desk. She asked the students to pull out their earbuds so they could listen to a short video about ancient Rome. Some of the kids looked around; oops, they forgot their earbuds. “That’s a new little problem,” she said. “Kids used to forget pencils, now they forget earbuds.” Working from Google classroom, Coelho can track student responses on daily journal entries or small quizzes as they come in. She can submit answers for multiple choice or true and false questions and the program will automatically grade students' answers. On writing assignments, Coelho can offer feedback directly into a student’s essay, even communicating with the student in real-time – digitally. Teachers, who are driving how the Chromebooks are used in their classrooms, can develop assignments together, making changes or offering revisions directly into a shared document. But it’s about what the technology does for the students, Coelho said, adding that the students will often find ways to use programs she could never figure out on her own. “There’s like a classroom and all the work we can just click on this and go to an assignment,” said 11-year-old Hayden Goldstein as he showed off his Chromebook. “We get to use computers in school; it’s more fun than just using a book.” Using nearly $1.4 million of its over-$1.7 million Smart School state technology allocation, Mohonasen last month rolled out the Chromebooks to every sixth-grade student and Chromebook carts to be shared among classes in other grades – 750 Chromebooks in all. The spending included small upgrades to the district network, purchase of a new phone system and other classroom technology. Every school district in the state gets a cut of the $2 billion state bonds approved by voters in 2014 to enhance technology in schools. Winning state approval for its Smart Schools spending plan in June, Mohonasen is among the earliest districts to move forward with the months-long process of seeking public input and getting school board approval for a spending plan before submitting it to the state. A committee of state officials meets every few months to approve the plans. Their first round of purchases have gotten into the classrooms over the past few months and they plan to submit for state reimbursements this spring. But school district leaders throughout the Capital Region are not of one mind of how to best spend the Smart School money. While some districts are using the money to jumpstart major laptop initiatives – moving toward one computer for every student – others are shoring up network infrastructure and expanding high-tech school security. The Ballston Spa school district, one of the few districts in the region planning to move forward with at least some computer-based testing this spring, hasn’t advanced any plan yet.   Of course, different districts have different needs and some have more developed technology infrastructure than others. But the different approaches to spending the Smart School dollars may represent different answers to a basic question: Is it smart for schools to use a one-time infusion of state cash to purchase technology with a lifespan as short as four or five years? Niskayuna Superintendent Cosimo Tanogrra Jr. said he doesn’t think it’s appropriate to spend bond dollars on products that will be obsolete in a shorter timeframe than the debt will be paid off. That’s why the district doesn’t plan to use its Smart Schools money on student and classroom devices that would ultimately need to be replaced using general fund dollars. “I do feel an obligation to be not only a steward of the local taxpayer dollars but any of the taxpayer dollars that come into the district,” Tangorra said. Niskayuna’s initial plan uses nearly $490,000 – one third of its $1.49 million allotment – to replace over 200 aging surveillance cameras throughout the district and improve its digital video archiving capabilities. Tangorra said he hopes to have a plan in place for the next phase of Smart Schools spending in the next two months – a plan that will be focused on improving the district’s network infrastructure. Fonda-Fultonville technology director Jarrod Baker said the rural district is focused on replacing old cabling at the high school and replacing and expanding the number of internet access points. With its inital $1.1 million Smart School spending, the district can replace all of its current 44 access points, and add 56 new ones, putting a wireless access point in every other classroom. The cabling work lays the foundation for the district to eventually add access points in every classroom, Baker said. By strengthening the basic network infrastructure, Baker said, the district will be positioned to roll out an expansion of student devices. “As we look to the future and student devices and teacher devices, those things should come from the regular budget and regular funds,” Baker said. “It’s not a question of it (there will be more devices), it’s a question of when. The density of device will require more thorough wireless coverage.” But nearby districts – such as Mohonasen, Schalmont, Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake – aren’t afraid to use the Smart Schools money to plow forward with big investments in classroom technology, including hundreds of Chromebook laptops for students, iPads and interactive whiteboards. Officials in those districts say they are planning to transition the costs of subsequent replacement of those devices – which will quickly become the baseline expectation for students and parents – to general funds. They also point out that some future technology purchases will still be partially covered by different state aid formulas. While Schalmont has moved further toward a one-to-one student-computer ratio than nearly any other district in the region, it also faces a challenging budget picture this year and officials expect to face budget holes in coming years as well. The district started a sixth-grade digital literacy class and has Chromebooks in the hands of nearly every middle-schooler. Just the other week, the school board approved the purchase of a digital social studies textbook for sixth-graders. The district thinks it can use the Smart Schools money to deliver laptops to nearly all of its students in middle and high school grades.    Schalmont Superintendent Carol Pallas said the district plans to prioritize its technology investments in coming years, even as it considers cuts in this year’s budget to teacher aides, out-of-district special education placements, athletic travel and field trips.    “I don’t believe that we will be able to say never mind, we won’t have such things,” Pallas said of the student laptops and other technology. “Teaching kids to be digitally literate is a real priority. We know this is the right thing to do for kids and we will try our best to maintain and sustain it in the budget.” Of Capital Region district’s that have submitted spending plans, some have also taken a balanced approach. While Saratoga Springs plans to spend nearly $2 million on classroom technology, the district is also planning to spend nearly $500,000 on its wireless connections. To Mohonasen, the state funding will serve to jumpstart its broader goal of getting more technology into the classroom, district Finance Director Chris Ruberti said. Over time the district will plan for replacing computers from the general fund.  “Smart Schools can be an infusion that gets the initiative up and running,” Ruberti said. “We then have a multi-year plan to wean off of Smart Schools [funding].” The district’s goal is for every student in sixth through 12th grades to have his or her own Chromebook – a low-priced Google-powered laptop – that would be used in class and at home. Using its first batch of Smart Schools money, the district got a computer for all of its sixth-graders. Beginning in the fall, it will do the same for two grades each year until all of its middle and high school students have computers by the school year that starts in 2020. At that point, the district will have to replace about 400 to 450 laptops each year, which will partially be offset using the district’s BOCES reimbursement rate from the state – paying for about two-thirds of those certain technology purchases. He pointed out that with the one-to-one computers for students, the district won’t have to replace desktops at the same level it has in the past. “There’s also some costs you are avoiding,” Ruberti said. Starting in kindergarten Meanwhile, even Mohonasen kindergartners get a daily dollop of technology. Every classroom at Bradt Primary School, the district’s kindergarten-through-second-grade school, has an interactive whiteboard that teachers use for hands-on math lessons, animated videos and book read-alouds.   “We have conversations about reliable sources and being responsible on the computer,” Bradt Principal Leslie Smith said. “Kids are so curious at this age and hopefully we see it continue; technology can be that bridge to carry that curiosity forward.” In Jessica Filarecki’s kindergarten class on Thursday, math time was spent with the interactive white board. Each student had a work mat at their desk with a series of simple subtraction problems and red felt counters to work out each problem. On the white board, Filarecki called on different students to work out the problem. With the touch and swipe of a pen, the students can make big red dots appear and disappear. “There were four students on the stage and one walked away. How many are left?” Filarecki asked. One of the students walked up to the board, where a previous student had placed four digital counters and swiped one away. Four minus one equals three.

The next version of Android isn’t due for an unveiling until May, but here are all the rumors and alleged features you need to know.  ( Android | Twitter ) Advertisement It's only down to two months until Google officially unveils the next major version of Android following Nougat, which will unsurprisingly hold the moniker "O," following the company's wacky confectionery-themed version releases. While the name is one aspect that's fun to speculate about — many are pointing to popular cookie Oreo, which mirrors the similarly branded Android version KitKat — the features of Android O is where the real story is. New Android O Rumored Features Although the OS itself won't likely be released until fall, it doesn't mean rumors have not started pouring in. They have, and a new one has arrived, even. Here's everything you need to know: • New Notifications System - According to 9to5Google, citing an unnamed source, the next version of Android will feature a revamped notifications system, although what that implies exactly is still ripe for guesswork. While Android Nougat's notification system isn't flawless, it's already pretty good, so the notion of an even better one is perfectly welcome. • Picture-in-Picture Mode - The report also claims that Android O will feature a picture-in-picture TV mode, similar to that of the Android TV. Other smartphones have been able to do such a mode for a long time now, and it's good to see Google finally stepping up to the plate. That is, of course, if the report is accurate. • App Badges - Like how it's done on iOS, Android O will reportedly feature app badges for any active notifications, which sounds simple enough. • Smart Text Selection - There's a vaguely put "smart text selection floating toolbar," which will somehow work in tandem with Google assistant, the report adds. • Other Features - There's also mention of improvements to the MediaRecorder API, restricted background app activity, adaptive icons, and a wellspring of rumors focused on enterprise. Other Rumored Android O Features Other previously rumored features of Android O are Copy Less, which is supposed to be a smarter way of copying chunks of text by determining the context of conversations and contents of an app; Finger gestures, which will lets users draw characters that trigger specific actions, such as drawing a "C" on the screen to access contacts; and the ability to click on links inside text messages that will bring up the appropriate app, such as clicking on an address to trigger Google Maps. What Will Android O Be Called? As previously mentioned, the next version of Android could be called Oreo, but of course, nothing is set in stone. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's Senior VP of Android, did tease that Android O will indeed be nicknamed Oreo via a tweet. Of course, that doesn't stand as a confirmation, seeing as Lockheimer could have just been jesting. But Oreo is the safest bet as of now. Honestly, what else could it be named after? Oatmeal Cookie? Ovaltine? Android O Release Date Google is expected to unveil Android O's name alongside its features by May 17 during its I/O developer conference. Per usual, that will be followed by a number of beta versions or developer previews before finally entering a wide stable release by fall. Expect due coverage as Android O nears the forefront. Thought of any good names for Android O? What about features? What would you like to see on the next version of Android? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!

This is the shocking video which any child could easily stumble across on Facebook – and which has remained online for more than two years, despite pleas for the web giant to remove it. The disturbing footage has been viewed more than seven million times and is just three clicks away from a simple search using innocuous terms on Google. Anyone who happens upon the film is then confronted with other equally shocking footage, including a mother attacking her traumatised toddler. This is the shocking video which any child could easily stumble across on Facebook – showing a man being viciously stabbed with a 15in knife again and again and left lying in a pool of his blood as he begs for his life When questioned by The Mail on Sunday, Facebook initially tried to justify its hosting of the films. It backed down yesterday and removed the horrific material while it mounted an investigation. Yet late last night the video of the attack reappeared on Facebook before coming down again. Leading politicians condemned the web giant amid the growing furore over the failure of other internet titans including Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, child abuse and other offensive material. Last night, Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘These videos are deeply disturbing as they involve torture, potentially murder, and child abuse. 'Facebook need to now review their entire systems, because these vile videos have been up for years. They need a system that can enforce their own standards the first time around.’ Typing the term 'Facebook video of man...' into Google brought up the top option '...being stabbed' as the website automatically suggests popular searches   It took users to a Facebook page where a 'disgusted' user complained about the video more than two years ago The committee quizzed the web giants last week. Labour MP Ms Cooper said: ‘Facebook admitted to us that their systems didn’t do enough to consider the context of images. The same is true in these cases.’ Media Secretary Karen Bradley said Facebook must ‘take responsibility’ to ensure their platform is not used to ‘celebrate horrendous acts of violence’. The sickening video came up after typing in the search term ‘Facebook video of man…’ on Google. The site’s auto-complete function, which is based on the most popular internet searches, then directed users to the first option ‘…man being stabbed’. Clicking on the top result brought users to a Facebook page where a ‘disgusted’ user complained about the video more than two years ago and provided a link in the hope the social media giant would take it down. The user complained: ‘It is vile that you allow this to be on your website after reviewing!’ The two-minute stabbing video was uploaded in October 2014 by Kim Quaresma, who is understood to be from Rio de Janeiro, with a message which translates as: ‘The drug traffickers do not forgive.’ In the footage, the man is also seen being savagely beaten with a metal pole, his screams muffled by tape across his mouth. One of the attackers, speaking in Portuguese, says: ‘Hey, look at how you end up. You got to take it… he’s a scumbag.’ It is not known whether the victim survived. The clip has been viewed more than 7.2 million times, with more than 120,000 shares, as well as being ‘liked’ 32,000 times. The only warning on the video is a message before users play it which reads: ‘Videos that contain graphic content can shock, offend and upset. Are you sure you want to see this?’ Facebook’s rules allow certain graphic or violent content to be shared only where users are ‘condemning it or raising awareness about it’ – but not when it is ‘shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence’. Such videos are also supposed to be blocked to under-18s, but experts said it was easy to circumvent the restriction. Their defence? The videos 'help' police. So why show film of a convicted child beater?  In October 2014 Quaresma uploaded another graphic video showing a mother repeatedly beating her baby over the head with her hand and a pillow After watching the torture video, web users would have seen on the very same Facebook page this clip of a teenage Malaysian mother repeatedly beating her baby over the head with her hand and a pillow. However the woman involved has reportedly already received an 18-month jail sentence for the attack, making a mockery of Facebook’s defence that such footage could help bring abusers to justice. Among the thousands of comments on the video, some glorify the violence, but others question why Facebook has not removed it. Viewers who check Quaresma’s other videos after watching the brutal attack will see that in October 2014 he uploaded another graphic video showing a mother repeatedly beating her baby over the head with her hand and a pillow as the screaming child rolls around in pain on a bed. The video, lasting more than four minutes, has been viewed 108,000 times and shared nearly 3,000 times. One user commented: ‘I reported this video but yet Facebook have reviewed it and do not think that it contains graphic violence. This is completely wrong.’ Another user wrote: ‘I reported it as well, unbelievable, should be taken down!’ The video is understood to show a teenage Malaysian mother beating her ten-month old child in 2011. The woman reportedly received an 18-month jail sentence. Another clip uploaded by Quaresma in September 2014 shows a boy being beaten by a group with a flip flop and having a rock thrown at his head. The video, believed to have been filmed in Brasilia, has been viewed 119,000 times and shared 1,200 times. As the boy lies on the floor during the attack, his face covered in blood, a Portuguese-speaking man says: ‘You are going to feel the pain, you understand?’ During the video, those beating him suggest that the boy has raped another child, but there is no evidence to support the allegation. The Civil Police in Brasilia told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There is no record of any report matching these facts.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Shocking footage of teenagers kicking and punching school...

Share this article Share Jim Gamble, former chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection unit, said: ‘For this generation of children who are using games like Grand Theft Auto, violence, sexism and extreme violence are being normalised so it creates this confusion in young people’s minds about what is real and what isn’t and what’s legitimate to do and what isn’t.’ Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ‘These are multi-billion pound companies who have the resources and expertise to do better. It’s now up to them to make sure their platforms are not used as a place to peddle hate and celebrate horrendous acts of violence.’ After being alerted to the predictive search options by The Mail on Sunday, Google took action to remove the suggested terms from appearing. Facebook initially refused to take down the clips when contacted on Friday, claiming that ‘videos like this may help identify abusers and bring help to victims, and we know that raising awareness of abuse can be an important part of stopping it’. However, yesterday it performed a U-turn and removed the footage while it conducts an investigation. A spokeswoman confirmed the video filmed in Malaysia has been permanently removed. She said: ‘In circumstances like this we mark the videos as disturbing, which means they have a warning screen and are accessible only to people over the age of 18. ‘Following such reports from The Mail on Sunday we have removed the content while we investigate. Where appropriate, we remove instances of videos from Facebook supporting or encouraging these kinds of behaviours.’ Mr Quaresma did not respond to a request for comment.

To expect that the national airline can compete with Emirates and Etihad, when both are completely protected and supported by the UAE government, is illogical and blatantly delusional By:   Syed Bakhtiyar Kazmi 19-Mar-17 1001 Top News ‘Identity card holders can enter Pakistan’ 21-Mar-17 321 ISLAMABAD: The National Databa ... ‘Honour killing is ‘brainchild’ of Gen Zia’ 21-Mar-17 249 ISLAMABAD: Honour killing reached South Asia fr ... A developing economy like Pakistan cannot afford to not have an industrial policy. The policy can be a good policy, a bad policy or a bullshit policy; except that there has to be an industrial policy. According to James Miller, “Any discussion of industrial policy should begin with (the) recognition that we have one. The issue is what type.” On a separate note, I concede that the word ‘bullshit’ has not been used with the panache that first-time usage deserved; my impatience got the better of me! Singapore has one; the aggressive pursuit of which is why they have managed to be the manufacturers and suppliers of high-value components to Multinational Corporation’s supply chain. Japan has one, managed by technocrats, insulated from political pressures, which is why in spite of it’s almost nill resources, the country remains one of the largest exporters of the world. China has one, which is the reason why they are now recognized as the manufacturing backyard of the world. And while too lazy to Google it, I am willing to take a bet that Germany has always had one, South Korea has one and now even Vietnam has one. Historically speaking, even the UK had one, which was aggressively imperialistic and included the colonization of the sub-continent by the East India Company. The repeal of the Corn Laws in the nineteenth century was also used to support the industry, amongst many other policy decisions to protect the domestic industry going bank to Henry I, and only when Britain decided to — or made the mistake of — unilaterally adopting free trade, were they disseated as the industrial power of the world. The Americans had one; tariff, to protect domestic industry, was the second bill signed by George Washington on Independence. Perhaps, the American civil war was also because of tariffs to protect the industry. And once again, the Americans feel the need to have an aggressive industrial policy and have elected President Trump to bring back manufacturing jobs. And does Pakistan have an Industrial Policy? I confess that I was completely ignorant about whether we had one or not, which meant that even if we had one, it was top secret and was, therefore, kept completely confidential. If we did not, industrialization was not amongst the priorities of the Government. Accordingly, the obvious recourse was a Google search, and the results were disheartening. Apparently, we had a 10-year industrial policy covering the period between 2005 and 2015, which based on the current state of exports, was probably not very effective. We apparently have an infrastructure policy and we have a CPEC policy, both of which, in tandem, are enablers for growth. Admittedly, during the construction period, infrastructure projects boost economic activity, but such gains are short term and short lived. Putting it bluntly, we need to have industry, and something to sell internationally, if this entire infrastructure and the CPEC opportunity is to finally bear fruit. Curiously, in fact, surprisingly and encouragingly, the Google search highlighted that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa issued its industrial policy in 2016. I was not aware of this and would like to suggest to its government to actively publicize the policy and proactively establish contact with business houses to generate interest. A bad policy is when you issue one and follow it up with inaction. For the record, the province offers interesting incentives: bearing five percent markup on financing for five years, which nowadays means free debt; financing 25 percent cost of industrial plots; subsidizing 25 percent of transportation costs from Karachi port to industrial site; bearing 25 percent of electricity cost for three years for labour-intensive industry; financing 25 percent of equity for projects set up by female entrepreneurs; and the exemption from custom duties and income tax in certain cases. It would be useful if other provinces followed suite and came out with their own industrial policies, however, unfortunately, provincial industrial policies will always have a pervasive limitation. Without tariff protection, infant industries will remain unable to compete with foreign corporations, who are generally protected by their respective countries and have the resources to sustain a prolonged price war. A favorite example is PIA. To expect that the national airline can compete with Emirates and Etihad, when both are completely protected and supported by the UAE government, is illogical and blatantly delusional. The downside of allowing access to China across the length and breadth of Pakistan is that we have simultaneously and unilaterally opened our market of 200 million Pakistanis to their industry, which can marginalize our own industry purely because of the economies of scale. And to again blast an irksome comment, the Chinese can definitely make cheaper jharoos as well. It is our choice whether we want to support the traders or manufacturers of Pakistan; the former will ultimately derive us over the cliff, no doubts about that. The worryingly growing external debt is the direct outcome of falling exports and increasing trade deficit, curtsey the traders. A careful study proves something, which has been repeated in this column numerous times: economic growth is directly correlated with growth in exports. For the lovers of the infernal GDP, the net trade balance is part of the GDP; qualitative growth is dependent upon the export of manufacturing, all else is an illusion and farcical. Manufacturing remains the quintessential increasing returns industry, agriculture and unskilled manufacturing will always face diminishing returns. In our case textile is our primary export engine, which in turn is dependent on cotton produced; we seem to be stuck around 11 million bales per annum of cotton production for years now and expect to increase our exports! Lately, there has been a lot of jubilation over the decision by Volkswagen to set up an assembly plant in Pakistan; to quote from a book I am at a loss to recall at the moment, “Lego brick manipulation of sophisticated inputs in an unsophisticated way”. The automobile industry, to my knowledge, under the industrial policy — when we did have one — was required to follow a strict deletion regime. How many have complied with that? Something is definitely wrong with our industrial strategy. Exporting mined natural resources or raw produce, while perhaps necessary in the short term, is not a durable policy either; such resources eventually deplete. Since we have decided not to build Kalabagh Dam, and are already water stressed, how long will we be able to keep growing cotton and exporting textile? Random financial incentives to the industry may or may not help. What is needed is a more dynamic approach. As a first step, there is a need to set up an empowered team of experts to understand our declining economic competitiveness and develop an industrial policy, if need be, laced with real incentives for the industry, which are deemed to be the future for Pakistan. Our national market should be used as a leverage against foreign corporations and ultimately a flat tariff across the board to protect domestic manufacture might well be a natural outcome. Without the benefit of complete knowledge, my guess is 30 percent. Irrespective, I sincerely hope that this article becomes a catalyst for an Industrial Policy.   The writer is a chartered accountant based in Islamabad.

That said, new rumors suggest we can expect a rather interesting set of features. According to 9to5Google, the upcoming version will bring changes to notifications, much in the same way Nougat has. It is unclear at the moment what the specifics are, but if we look at Google's forthcoming hybrid Chrome OS / Android operating system, we can see that cross-device notification syncing is a possible addition. Since we know the firm is planning to launch the Pixel 3 during the third quarter, it may not be that big of a stretch to assume aspects of the merged OS would trickle down to Android's upcoming version. Android O is also rumored to bring app icon badges for active notifications, providing an at a glance indication of what you may have missed while you were gone. There's also a so-called "adaptive icons" feature coming, which presumably means icons which change dynamically. This is currently the preserve of the Pixel launcher, which Google has not expressed an intention of bringing to non-Pixel devices. In an effort to improve battery life, the next version of Google's OS will also restrict background activities from apps, much in the same way Chrome 57 currently deals with tabs. It will be interesting to see how much the battery life will be extended as a result of these optimizations. Beyond the features above, a picture-in-picture mode similar to the one currently available in Android TV also seems to be on the cards. This suggests an intention to bring the feature to other devices, such as phones or tablets. ​Another potential feature is one that sounds similar to 'Copy Less', which emerged from a VentureBeat report earlier this month. The main idea is to help the user with 'smarter text selection", employing a floating toolbar with Google Assistant integrated. ​The MediaRecorderAPI (which allows apps to record audio and video, then save it to permanent storage) may also receive some improvements in Android O. No specifics are available at this time, however. Last but not least, "tons of enterprise stuff" is also rumored to be on the way, with no concrete details as to what this may entail. Nevertheless, all will be revealed in May, when Google's I/O Developer Conference kicks off.

Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 is set to rule the tablet market, but from what it seems, Google is catching up fast with the news about Nexus 7 2017. According to the rumors, the Nexus comeback is going to be a big hit. The Tab S3 was unveiled last month at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 event that took place in Barcelona. Specs Just like the recently announced device, Google Nexus 7 2017 will run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, with 4 GB RAM and 32 GB storage. Display Samsung Galaxy Tablet S3 comes with a 9.7 inches AMOLED screen that boasts a 1536×2048 pixels resolution. If the reports on this topic are true, Nexus 7 should come with a 7-inches display and a resolution of 2560×1440 pixels. Camera & Battery The Samsung product is expected to come with a 13 MP camera on the back and a 5MP one on the front. It is also endowed with a fingerprint scanner, plus a 6000 mAh battery, which is huge, especially if you take into account the fact that it will offer fast-charging features. Sadly, there is not enough information about these particular specs for the Google Nexus 7 2017 yet, but everybody expects it to be a worthy rival for Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. According to the reports, this is the first Google Nexus device that will be running on the Andromeda OS, which is a hybrid creation between the Chromebook OS and the Android one. We don’t know yet when will Google release its new device, but since it is designed as a rival for Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, most likely it will be launched around the same time. However, many people are skeptical about that, since the Tab S3 model can already be preordered and will start to be shipped on the 24th of March.

It seems like everything that Google is trying to do is going wrong. The Android parent recently pushed March’s security bulletin to its Nexus and Pixel smartphones and instead of enhancing security, this monthly patch managed to cause Nexus 6 to malfunction. In order to repair its mistake, Google is now rolling out a software downgrade to Nexus 6. Nexus 6 goes back to Android 7.0 Nougat A couple of months ago Google pushed Android 7.1.1 Nougat to Nexus 6 as a parting gift, but it looks like Google is not done with Nexus 6 yet. What happened was that when Nexus 6 owners upgraded their operating system with March’s security patch, the smartphone automatically disabled Android Pay. This feature is quite essential and not having access to it is rather annoying. Google’s Product Forum and the Nexus subreddit have been filled with Nexus 6 owners that were reporting this error. On the bright side, this news has reached Google’s ears. Sadly, the Android parent doesn’t have an answer to this issue and decided to roll out a software downgrade that brings Nexus 6 back to the public and stable version of Android 7.0 Nougat. Nexus 6 Community is Confused The entire Nexus 6 community is lashing back at Google for this decision. In fact, many Nexus 6 owners have downloaded the update without reading the details and didn’t know what they were getting into. What’s actually angering the Nexus 6 community is the fact that they were expecting Google to release an OTA (over the air) software fix and not downgrade. In fact, many Nexus 6 owners believe that this downgrade was actually mistakenly rolled out. Google decided to clear up the confusion by posting on its official blog. The Android parent confirmed that this downgrade is no mistake and that all Nexus 6 owners should downgrade their operating system. In addition, Google also stated that once it figures out how to fix the Android Pay bug it will push Android 7.1.1 Nougat once again. Hopefully Google won’t take its time and roll out the update in the upcoming weeks.

The biggest rivalry in the smartphone world used to be the one between Samsung and Apple, but now Google has joined in the race. We think it’s safe to say that Apple’s iPhone 7 is in a league of its own because it runs on iOS, but Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Google’s Pixel are competing against each other on a daily basis. Customers never know which one deserves their money the most, but today we’re going to try and clear that up by pining Galaxy S7 and Pixel against each other in order to see how well the fare. This brief comparison will be focused on the hardware power these two flagships are offering. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Hardware Performance The South Korean tech manufacturer knows that hardware power is very important and that’s why it decided to equip the smartphone with its own octa-core Exynos 8890 chipset. The processor features four cores that clock at 2.3GHz Mongoose and other four ones that have been clocked at 1.6GHz Cortex-A53. Even better, Samsung has coupled the processor with a Mali-T880 MP 12 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. On the other hand we have Pixel, the smartphone is believed to represent Google’s vision of a perfect Android powered smartphone. Now let’s pop up its hood and see what’s fueling Pixel. Unlike Samsung, Google decided to go with one of Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 821 chipsets. The processor is actually faster than Galaxy S7’s chipset because it has two cores that clock at 2.15GHz Kyro and other two ones that feature a base clock speed of 1.6GHz Kyro. Google decided to spice things up and paired Pixel’s processor with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Verdict After closely inspecting their hardware performance, we can see why these two smartphones fit into the same category. Although many consider them as equals, Pixel has the upper hand. Google has made a wise decision when it chose to collaborate with Qualcomm since its Snapdragon 821 processor is slightly faster than Galaxy S7’s Exynos 8890 chipset.

Seeing the Google started losing interest for its older Nexus handheld devices ever since the Pixel lineup was launched, everyone started believing that Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are going to be forgotten. The Android parent decided to prove everyone wrong this month when it rolled out March’s security bulletin to both Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Google has yet to Forget about Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P Even though rumors were pointing towards a Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P discontinuation, it looks like both Google smartphones are not going anywhere. Some actually believe that Google wants to revive these two smartphones in order to boost its sales percentages. The way Google is doing this is by keeping both Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P up to date with all of its latest operating system updates. Pixel doesn’t have the Same Brand Recognition as Nexus As previously mentioned, Google wants to increase its profit revenue by revitalizing Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. The reason why Google is feeling compelled to do that is because neither Pixel nor Pixel XL is selling that well in foreign countries. Both Pixel smartphones are considered as high-quality products but the Pixel brand isn’t globally recognized. This is where Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P come in. Google wants to bring Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P Back The Nexus brand has been alive for a bunch of years now and it has managed to gather quite a large fan-base, especially since it represents the “Pure” Android experience. Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are selling in large amounts of units in foreign markets such as Europe and Asia and that’s why Google wants to bring them back. What’s interesting is that according to rumors, Pixel’s success is actually hindered by the fact that Nexus 6P is still one of the most desirable Android smartphones. While this might sound like competition, it’s actually not. This is a win-win situation for the Android parent. It can keep Pixel and Pixel XL as premium smartphones while Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P cater to mid-ranged budgets.

The Android parent recently started rolling out an OTA (over the air) update that gives Gmail users the ability to transfer, receive and ask for currency straight from the mobile app. However, this feature is exclusive in the US at the moment but it will probably see a worldwide roll out during the upcoming future. Gmail Receives Google Wallet Features The best thing about this feature is that it’s quite simple to use. Google is renowned for putting a high price on user experience and that’s why its user interfaces are always minimalistic and simple to use. Right now we will go over the process of sending or requesting money with Gmail in order to showcase exactly how simple the process is. Tap on the Gmail icon and then select the Compose button that can be found in the bottom right side; Select the Paper Clip button and then tap on the “Send Money” or “Request Money” options; Now type in the amount of currency that’s going to be sent or requested and tap on the “Continue” button; Gmail will now ask the user to input a payment method such as Debit Card in the Google Wallet app; All that’s left is to type in a memo and select the “Attach Money” option; Additionally, because this is currency transfer or request is basically an email attachment, users will also be required to select a recipient, message and subject. Worth noting is that the recipient doesn’t necessarily have to be a Gmail user or even use Google Wallet. The currency will be transferred straight to the recipient’s Google Wallet account free of charge. Even better if the recipient doesn’t have a Google Wallet account, he can choose to receive the money straight into his bank account also free of charge. Google will also roll out a confirmation email to both the sender and receiver in order to avoid any confusion. To wrap things up, it looks like Gmail will still remain the first the most popular email platform if Google keeps on enhancing it like this.

I’m also not much of an early adopter – I love trying the latest gadgets, but I usually find myself waiting for the second generation of products to arrive before I hop on the bandwagon. Now, I’m irked by the thought of a Google Home speaker playing ads along with its usual programming, as some users found yesterday when Assistant included a promo for Beauty and the Beast while announcing their agenda for the day. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Thanks, but no thanks, Google. It’s bad enough that virtually anything with a screen these days will eventually show you an ad (that’s why I still love and cherish my trusty old 120GB iPod), but speakers too? In a statement to The Verge, Google appeared to suggest that it didn’t intend to begin serving ads through Assistant this way: This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. To be fair, we already come across ads on devices and services we pay for, including ones that are on all the time: our phones, computers, car radios and TVs. And it seems inevitable that promotional content will eventually blare over our smart speakers. The data we feed the companies that make them – by searching the Web and granting access to our email and calendar – already helps flesh out our individual profiles so ads can be targeted to us. As we’ve seen with smartphones, the rapid pace of development in consumer technology seems to be normalizing phenomena that we may not be comfortable with. While we just wanted a better mobile device, we’re now carrying around devices that track and report our every move. It looks like we’ll soon go the same way with speakers. What’s troubling is that it becomes increasingly difficult for people to avoid buying into tech like this, even if they aren’t sold on the implications of the terms of service they signed up for. It won’t be long before we find it odd that people use their phones to shop for things when they can just order stuff by asking Amazon’s Alexa to do so from across the room. While ads on connected speakers feel like a deal breaker right now, they’re probably going to become the norm pretty soon. But hey, maybe we’ll at least get some memorable jingles out of this, like we did with FM radio. Ah, who am I kidding? We’re doomed.

Havas cut ties with Google and its subsidiary, YouTube, after investigative reporters found clients' ads popping up alongside offensive videos. Virginia Mayo/AP/File | Caption Loading... Patrick Reilly Staff | @PatrickfReilly March 18, 2017 —As an al-Shabab militant called for jihad inside Kenya, an ad at the base of his YouTube video urged viewers to “Book Now” for a Sandals tropical vacation. An armed neo-Nazi promoting Combat 18 was paired with a call to volunteer for the hospice charity Marie Curie. Last month, an investigation by The Times of London detailed these as two examples of how major brand names frequently appear alongside hateful YouTube content. A separate article by The Guardian wrote that the UK revenue from these ads amounts to about £250,000, or $318,000, for “extremists and hate preachers.” On Friday, ad agency Havas Media, whose high-profile clients include Hyundai and the Royal Mail, announced that it would stop placing ads on YouTube and its parent company, Google. The tech giant – which commands more than 30 percent of global online ad revenue and draws 90 percent of its own revenue by placing ads – was quick to respond. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear,” wrote Google UK managing director Ronan Harris. In recent months, online activists have been targeting offensive Web content by trying to shut off their streams of ad revenue. Havas’s decision marks an early win for this strategy, but could also give a taste of fights to come. In Pictures Keeping watch: security or privacy invasion? “I think that advertisers are becoming wary because they're seeing consumer backlash,” says David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at Parsons New School of Design. Havas’s decision – which it made on behalf of its UK clients – indeed prompted Google to change course. But Professor Carroll, who researches how we use digital media to interact, doesn’t think the playing field has shifted. In a phone interview with The Christian Science Monitor, he observes that, because of the largely-automated, milliseconds-long online advertising process, “advertisers, brands, and publishers [still] have no control over where these ads show up.” When clients’ ads get paired with offensive content, websites “have to act defensively.” When an online ad appears on a racist or terrorist YouTube video, the video’s creator gets most of the revenue, with Google also taking a cut for its role in placing the ad. When it appears on a website like Breitbart – which has been widely accused of spreading fake news and offensive content – most of the money goes to that publisher. If the viewer finds either type of content offensive, Carroll explains, the real losers are the ad firms and and their clients. With the rise of social media, “a new purpose of news is to show other people what you believe in.” This means that, “if people are rejecting a particular publisher because it is spreading what they believe as falsehoods, or is spreading hyper-partisan, very damaging misinformation,” then brands and ad agencies face greater pressure to cut ties with that publication. Applying this pressure has become a new, effective form of consumer activism. One Twitter group, the Sleeping Giants, flags brands whose ads appear on Breitbart. It claims nearly 1,600 ad removals so far. “It's hard to imagine that Havas had not watched the Sleeping Giants thing very closely,” says Carroll. But at the same time, “the only way to solve this problem was through shame.” He expects this pattern of activist groups calling out companies to continue, until a bigger change happens in how companies reach consumer eyeballs via the Web. The fact that a Sandals ad showed up under al-Shabab’s video had little to do with the terrorist group, and more with the vacation preferences of whoever clicked on the video. In the internet era, “ads are no longer placed based on the context,” like a particular magazine for a print ad or a neighborhood for a billboard. Instead, advertising firms focus on “matching ads to people.” As you browse, cookies collect information about which sites you visit. Each ad that you see – including the ones appearing next to this article on the Monitor’s website – reflects those prior habits. These programs don’t just determine the ads that show up next to offensive content; they also help unsavory characters spread that content. As Carroll puts it, the "technology that matches your preference [for] laundry detergent is the same technology that matches a hyper-partisan inflammatory falsehood that you're going to share on your streams because you want to believe it.” Is an end to these practices in sight? If so, it could come next year, when a new set of EU data-protection laws is scheduled to take effect. The new codes – likely to affect US companies – switch from a system where “you having to know who's collecting data about you, and opt out of it,” to a model where the internet user has to opt in to a data-collection operation. That may not sound like much, but Carroll thinks it could help internet users discern good and bad forms of data collection – and, in doing so, push “a lot of the bad actors out of the marketplace – and restore “highly-trusted relationships between users, companies, publishers, and advertisers.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign Up × For this reason, he thinks Havas and its competitors have a major stake in letting the new law take effect, and relying less on user data collection. “Realize how bad things are,” he advises, “and look for the opportunity to fix this, rather than see this as just another crisis.” Did this story deliver on 'values & ideals'?    Thanks for your feedback.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. This year is going to be a good for tech enthusiasts. All major companies have announced that they are preparing to launch their flagship smartphones during the upcoming future. Although the entire world is talking about Samsung’s Galaxy 8 and Apple’s iPhone 8, Google is also preparing something big. In fact, the company’s Vice President attended MWC and announced that the upcoming Pixel 2 will “stay premium”. We can’t know for sure what this means but we think it’s safe to say that the upcoming Google smartphone will be able to take on both Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8. Three Pixel 2 Smartphones The Android parent has done a good job of keeping its mouth shut when asked about its upcoming smartphone but, rumor has it that there will be three Pixel 2 devices and not just one. A couple of days ago two Google smartphone codenames have been leaked, Muskie and Walleye. These two devices are expected to be Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL but what’s interesting is that another code name has surfaced. Muskie, Walleye and Taimen According to rumors and speculations, the third Pixel smartphone has been codenamed as Taimen. Just like Muskie and Walleye, the third Pixel device has also been codenamed after a fish. The entire Android community believes that Taimen is actually going to be a more affordable Pixel 2. This goes hand in hand with previous rumors that were pointing out the fact that Google wants to capitalize on mid-ranged budgets. Last year, Google adopted the size format that Samsung and Apple use and launched Pixel in two sizes. Well, it looks like this year we’re in for a third Pixel smartphone. This is actually great news since not everyone is able to afford a $759.00 phone. The Android parent is probably going to equip this affordable Pixel model with a smaller display and lower amount of RAM so that it’s able to reduce its price. Nonetheless, everyone doubted that Google will be able to make it on its own on the smartphone market when it decided to part ways with Huawei but Google proved everyone wrong. Pixel and Pixel XL are considered as being some of the best Android powered smartphones ever made.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS What we can learn about the future of meetings from Google John Brandon@jmbrandonbb March 18, 2017 1:15 PM Tags: ai, bots, chatbots, Google, Hangouts Chat, machine learning Image Credit: Google I process meeting requests all day, especially on Fridays (when I typically hold a few phone briefings and meet with volunteers at a local college). You’d think someone would have figured out how to improve this process in the time since my corporate career ended around 2001. Back then, I sat through countless meetings every day…all day long. You can feel sorry for me now. My “other” full-time job at the time was adjusting my schedule. It was often difficult to know who was actually available and in the office, even if Outlook gave me a few clues. No one had invented a sensor for tracking the boss. These days, a few apps help somewhat, but they live on their own outside of my normal routines — a.k.a., using Gmail and Google Cal. I can chat all day on Slack, but meetings are not really part of that ritual. I still have to manually add meetings and manage them in my Google Calendar. I know I could use X.ai, but that uses email — yet another app. In a recent demo, a Google rep explained to me how Hangouts Chat could change that, and it made me think of many other novel ways a bot could all but remove the tedium of managing a daily schedule. The @meet bot from Hangouts is nothing special. You tag the bot and name a day and time, and the bot sifts through everyone’s schedule and finds an open slot, then books the meeting. What impressed me about it wasn’t the actual feature set (which includes an option to hold a meeting right now and creates a Hangouts link) but the possibility for what could come next. The bot uses some basic machine learning. In the demo, the rep showed how the bot can see who is in the chat and make sure everyone is on the invite list. It can scan the schedules for everyone involved because the chat tool runs in G Suite, the office version of Gmail and Google Calendar. It’s a bit like having an assistant who does the meeting invites. But I want it to go much further. I’d like to activate the bot before the discussion starts, tagging @meet so that it watches what we say and then jumps in and suggests a meeting time when we start talking about needing to meet. It could constantly look for the words meeting and meet in every Hangouts Chat channel. That might be helpful, but the bot could then use more machine learning to parse the conversation even further. How about noting that one of the participants is actually a contractor and never attends any meetings? Skip that person on the next one. Or the bot could split us into two different meeting groups when it sees that some of us are in marketing and some are in sales. It could also look at conference rooms. In the office with the college volunteers, we use a tool called Ad Astra to book conference rooms. It’s old tech. I’d like the @meet bot to look at who is chatting and find an open room that’s closest to everyone involved. Maybe it can learn that we normally book rooms with larger windows, or that the exec who attends these meetings prefers the space next to the coffee machines. It’s not that hard. When the exec types “I prefer to meet in the space next to the coffee machines,” keeping track of that is not a Herculean challenge for a bot. And all of this is something that would occur in the background. We’d never have to think about meeting requests at all. We’d have a bot that manages meetings, arranges them, notifies us about them, adjusts them — we’d simply have to show up. Hopefully, Google will make this happen soon.

Rather than doing these on paper or hacked using Word, Fireworks or similar, it would be useful to have a simple web interface to create these and collaborate on them with clients (remotely if necessary).

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ARVR Guest WebVR isn’t sexy, but it will change the game for VR this year Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh@whiteboxamir March 18, 2017 12:10 PM Tags: A-Frame, Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh, BabylonJSor, gravr, PlayCanvas, PrimroseVR, ReactVR, Roland Dubois, Vizor, WebVR, Zeovr Above: From A-Frame's image gallery at https://aframe.io Events have taken a dramatic turn since I published an article last September on how WebVR, the JavaScript API that allows immersive VR experiences to be played straight from your web browser, will make virtual reality massively available. Back then the only big player that was generating some appreciable degree of buzz was the pioneer itself, Mozilla, with their WebVR open source library, A-Frame. But in the past several months news began to roll out from the likes of Google, Samsung, Microsoft, and Oculus, each giant announcing advances in powering up their browsers with WebVR. “We are now capable of creating VR content that is available on the most widespread medium in existence by simply sharing a URL,” Diego Gonzalez, Developer Advocate for Samsung Internet told me. Last month Google announced that Chrome now supports WebVR on Daydream-ready Android devices and that they’re in the process of broadening that access to include desktop operating systems, which will be a huge stepping stone for companies interested in leveraging VR on the web. Google’s UX Lead for WebVR Josh Carpenter explained the company’s motivation: “Volume of content matters. The ability for anyone to create and publish their vision matters. We view the web as a complement to native virtual reality, helping create new types of content, with wide distribution, and no-friction consumption.” Other WebVR-friendly browsers include Samsung’s Internet browser, available on its Gear VR headset, Microsoft’s preview version for its Edge browser, and the Firefox Nightly browser. Oculus is building its own native WebVR browser, coined Carmel, which is available in the developer preview — we’ll surely hear more about as we approach the F8 developer conference coming up next month. Above: WebVR Minecraft demo built in A-Frame. “We believe WebVR is one of the crucial ways to drive adoption for VR because it promises to exponentially increase the number of developers building great content,” Oculus’ WebVR product manager Andrew Mo told me. “And the cross-platform nature of WebVR enables users to easily share and connect with their friends outside VR and show them what they are missing.” Holding true to the nature of the web as a garden without walls or fences, there are a variety of WebVR frameworks that developers can work with aside from A-Frame. Vizor, PlayCanvas, and BabylonJSor are popular along with VR developer engines like PrimroseVR and Zeovr. Oculus’ own open source library, ReactVR, is available as a pre-release. “The beauty of WebVR is that it works on many platforms now with many more on the way, and tools like A-Frame mean that creative self-expression has been opened up to more people around the globe. Sharing is as fast and simple as sharing a web page, and it’s open to anybody,” Mozilla SVP of Emerging Technologies Sean White told me via email. “Now that others have joined in, we hope they will develop their tools and applications in such a way that will ensure they remain relatively easy to standardize and can be supported on multiple browsers and VR headsets.” WebVR has the inherent potential to grow like wildfire because it is frictionless by design. No downloads. No installs. No locks or keys. No queuing in front of some arbitrary bouncer. It’s the fastest way to build and share VR content, sidestepping the walled gardens that have popped up, feebly trying to segregate audiences before they even appear and hoping to copy and paste the old app store business model onto an emerging ecosystem. WebVR is also the easiest way to learn VR, thanks to its open source DNA, which makes it both more available and better able to drawing in and onboard a wide pool of talent. “Now you see something on this web page and you wonder how it is done, what can you do about it? Display the source. You can now study how a nice visual effect was done, copy-paste it, modify it, break it, fix it, adapt it to your own need,” Fabien Benetou, a WebVR developer well known in the A-Frame community, told me. “Thanks to this, WebVR is the most efficient way to learn VR.” Only HTC appears to be slow, or too stubborn, to join the party, and I have a working hypothesis. WebVR isn’t sexy. At least not yet. In fact, at this stage in its development, it often looks like VR from the ’80s and ’90s, particularly because the developer community isn’t prioritizing consumer-facing applications quite yet. WebVR isn’t going to immediately offer the kind of high-fidelity experiences that the industry has been hyping up as a lure to ignite consumer adoption. And it’s not yet capable of servicing the high-octane gaming and entertainment experiences that are being touted as the primary appeal of VR to the mainstream. WebVR does, however, promise a broad, versatile, and far reaching impact on various industries already firmly rooted in the web. Think about any web-based industry and you can easily imagine a WebVR extension to enhance the value-add and bottom line. Think media: You could be reading a news article about an event taking place in a city on the other side of the world and immediately be able to load up the specific environment and circumstance in VR, without ever leaving your browsing experience. Or e-commerce: You could jump into a brief guided tour of that same city while considering the ticket costs of booking a flight. How about consumer goods? You can get a good feel for WebVR’s sober approach by looking at the fruits of the WebVR Hackathon run by Aquinas Training in NYC back in December. One of its champions, Roland Dubois, won the best app category with “gravr — A Globally Recognized Avatar for VR on the web”, a VR profile API that follows a user from VR experience to VR experience, customized to them and based on their hardware and real-life environment. Above: Roland Dubois’ gravr concept, “A Globally Recognized Avatar for VR on the Web” Dubois’ work highlights one particularly awesome aspect of WebVR: It provides the building blocks for what developers are calling the Metaverse, an interconnected virtual world where users can travel from one immersive experience to the next, like walking through an infinite series of doors that take you through an endlessly growing virtual universe. Here’s how Thomas Balouet, cofounder of WebVR-based startup LucidWeb, explains it: “You know that feeling you have when you just want to check a cooking recipe on the Internet, and two hours later you’re reading an article about Patagonia on Wikipedia? Well, imagine you put on your headset to watch a cool relaxing experience, and 15 minutes later you find yourself talking with friends on top of a mountain or flying over your home town. That’s what the Metaverse would be, and this kind of situation would be possible only with deep-linking, one place bringing you to another one related to it, without you having to come back to a common place, or even realizing you’re leaving the first place. Only WebVR can enable that.” Being in the VR industry, I hear a lot about the search for the killer VR app — an app that will finally get mainstream users flocking to VR. Well, maybe we’re looking in the wrong place for that trigger. Maybe it’s not an app that we should be looking for but a platform that offers a paradigm shift, fuelled by the web. An interconnected array of virtual reality experiences, tools, and products could blow our collective minds. Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh is the cofounder at Virtuleap, a sandbox for creative developers to showcase their VR concepts. He is also the European Partner at Edoramedia, a games publisher and digital agency with headquarters in Dubai. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

The unique virtual helping hand is Google's newest take to crack down Apple's similar assisting agent: Siri. But several users of Android-based tablets raised their query about Google Assistant's unavailability on their devices. Most of them, having tablets running on Nougat or Marshmallow, the haven't received any update or pop-up in the recent timeline for enabling Google Assistant. The confusion created among them about it has finally been clarified by Google itself. According to Android Police, Google stated that currently, the company is rolling out Google assistant to Android led smartphones only. The Android-running tablets won't be a part of this lineup. The company authority exclaimed: "The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets." Just after this declaration was officially announced, many analysts and experts came up with their own version of reasons for this sudden take, but the following potential source rightly defined the cause of such decision made by Google. As per a report by The Verge, Google may be possibly trying to have a slow move with Google Assistant. It should be noted in this context that the company took months to roll out its supreme assisting agent to Android smartphones other than that of Google's very own Pixel range. Similarly, as Android phones are more popular among tech fans than Android tablets. So, may be to focus more on its usability and the level of appreciation among Android handset users, Google is holding back the official roll-out of Google Assistant on other Android led devices. Advertisement As far as the specs are concerned, Google Assistant can be considered as a potential replacement to Google Search App. Although, the agent still needs to be upgraded a bit more. There are certain backlogs witnessed with the agent like Google Assitant's inability to recognise songs, reading messages, assign tasks etc. Hopefully, Google would sort these out quickly alongside bringing up some more usefulness of its newest agent.

This results in dramatically faster large-scale analytics and transactions without significantly increasing development and management overhead. Get the GridGain White Paper. Google on Thursday announced Guetzli, a new contribution to its evolving set of tools for the open source community. Guetzli is an encoder that allows JPEG files to be compressed as much as 35 percent, resulting in much faster Web page loading. "Guetzli," which means "cookie" in Swiss German, allows users to create smaller JPEG images while maintaining compatibility with existing Web browsers, image processing applications and the existing JPEG standard, noted Robert Obryk and Jyrki Alakuijala, software engineers at Google Research Europe, in an online post. It produces a result similar to that of Google's Zopfli algorithm, which produces smaller PNG and gzip files without the requirement of a new file format, they explained. The technique is different from RNN-based image compression, RAISR and WebP, all of which need ecosystem and client changes for compression at Internet scale. Google first introduced the Zopfi compression algorithm in 2013 and two years later unveiled Brotli, which offered faster page loads and up to 26 percent higher compression ratios than Zopfi. Microsoft late last year announced support for Brotli in Edge, which would make it broadly interoperable across major browsers, as the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox already supported Brotli. Quality and Compression JPEG resolution quality is directly correlated to its multi-stage compression process, Obryk and Alakuijala explained. "Guetzli specifically targets the quantization stage in which the more visual quality loss is introduced, the smaller resulting file," they wrote. "Guetzli strikes a balance between minimal loss and file size by employing a search algorithm that tries to overcome the difference between psychovisual modeling of JPEG's format and Guetzli's psychovisual model." The model approximates color perception and visual masking in a more detailed way than what can be achieved through simpler color transforms and discrete cosine transforms, according to the engineers. 16x16 pixel synthetic example of a phone line hanging against a blue sky -- traditionally a case where JPEG compression algorithms suffer from artifacts. Uncompressed original is on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artefacts than libjpeg (middle) and has a smaller file size. During experiments with human raters, Obryk and Alakuijala continued, images produced by Guetzli were preferred over images from libjpeg files, even when the latter files were the same size or slightly larger, making the slower compression a worthy tradeoff. 20x24 pixel zoomed areas from a picture of a cat's eye. Uncompressed original on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artefacts than libjpeg (middle) without requiring a larger file size. The hope is that the format webmasters and graphic designers will embrace the format for running image-heavy websites, and that mobile users will see reduced load times and bandwidth costs, the engineers said. Deep Learning Google likely has developed the deep learning expertise and compute resources to tackle such a feat from a new vantage point, suggested Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Image storage is a top priority for consumer cloud services, retail, advertising and other industries, he noted. "My educated guess is that Google made Guetzli public because Google doesn't control most of the endpoints that capture the images that Google then stores for image searches," Teich told LinuxInsider. "It makes Google's business run a little better if everyone uses Guetzli as their native JPEG format -- and the same is true for other cloud services that handle images at scale, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram." There likely will be a version of Guetzli for motion video compression as well. RAISR, which Google introduced in November, uses machine learning to turn low-resolution images into high-quality photos. WebP images are 26 percent smaller than PNGs and up to 34 percent smaller than JPEG images Making the Guetzli technology available as an open source tool will help speed adoption and return significant benefits for Google, said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "Google makes money off ads," he told LinuxInsider. "Slow load times lower ad views, so by speeding up the Web, they'll make a ton more money." Dropbox engineers were excited to find that Guetzli interoperates with Lepton, the streaming image compression format Dropbox released to the open source community last summer. "In preliminary testing, we are seeing real advantages in combining Guetzli with Lepton, as long as you apply Guetzli first," said Daniel Reiter Horn, staff software engineer at Dropbox. "For example, one test we tried resulted in ~24 percent savings from Guetzli and an additional ~22 percent compression from Lepton, with default settings," he told LinuxInsider. "The result was a total savings of ~41 percent over the default file," Horn said. "The math makes sense, because Lepton gives 22 percent savings on the Guetzli file that's 75 percent of the original size... so the savings is 24 percent + (22 percent * 76 percent) = ~41 percent." Google's own team had little to say about the release beyond the revelations in Obryk and Alakuijala's post, company rep Jason Freidenfelds told LinuxInsider. However, it did release a statement suggesting that it was, shall we say, compressing its wild enthusiasm: "Grt to hv all ths intrst - w'r vry exctd fr ths brkthrgh!"

The company will also be offering a free Google Home speaker hub with pre-orders of LG's new flagship phone - but rival US carriers are hoping to tempt buyers with even more enticing deals. Verizon and Sprint are also giving away a free Google Home with pre-orders of the G6, but on top of that, they're offering buyers a free HDTV with the device too. Verizon has opened pre-orders for the G6 priced at $672 up front, or $28 per month on a two-year plan. In addition to the free speaker, powered by Google Assistant, Verizon is also offering buyers a free 43-inch Smart TV for customers who switch to the carrier, or add a new line to their existing account, and add an unlimited plan. Sprint is also accepting pre-orders for the G6, but at a higher price. The handset will cost $708 up front, or you can pay $29.50 a month over two years. While the device costs more on Sprint, you'll still get the free Google Home, and the carrier is also offering a free 49-inch LG HDTV worth $349.99, as part of the package. AT&T is charging the most of any major US carrier, having priced the G6 at $719.99 up front, or $24 a month on a 30-month plan. An alternative plan is available, costing $30 per month for the handset over 24 months instead. As Mashable explained, along with the Google Home speaker, AT&T is offering a second free G6 if you pay for the first one in full and add a new line on AT&T Next. And if you sign up to a two-year AT&T Next agreement, AT&T will also offer you an LG Watch Sport, worth $349, for $49.99. There are plenty of options for those wishing to buy LG's new high-end handset in the US, and the biggest carriers are clearly eager to lure G6 buyers in their direction.

 Everything you need to know about the Google lawsuit that could derail Uber's future Steve Kovach Mar. 18, 2017, 8:00 AM 23,384 facebook linkedin twitter email print Anthony Levandowsk, Uber's self-driving car boss.YouTube The first self-driving car prototypes are already navigating the roads in a few cities. But the real action is about to take place in the courtroom.  Google and Uber, the two giants at the forefront of developing the technology, are vying to own the emerging market and to suck up the profits. The stakes are high and the fight is already getting personal, with Google accusing one of its star engineers of stealing some of its crown jewels.  Last month, Waymo, the self-driving company owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, sued Uber, claiming that one of its employees stole vital technology shortly before starting his own self-driving company (which Uber later acquired). Autonomous cars have the potential to upend massive industries ranging from transportation to auto manufacturing. For Google and Uber, the opportunity and the threat posed by a world of self-driving vehicles is huge. Google has been developing self-driving technology for the better part of a decade, and plans to license that technology to other car companies through Waymo. There's also a chance Waymo will eventually develop its own ride-hailing service powered by self-driving cars to compete directly with Uber. Uber only recently began exploring self-driving technology, but sees it as the next logical step to protect its business. One of the company's biggest expenses comes from giving drivers a share of the revenue generated on each ride. Cutting out the drivers in favor of self-driving cars would be huge for Uber's bottom line. (And, of course, bad for the drivers who rely on Uber to make a living.) If someone else beats Uber to that self-driving future, Uber will be at a major, perhaps fatal, disadvantage. The trade secrets case is shaping up to be one of the most significant and closely-watched battles in Silicon Valley in years, pitting two of the world's most powerful companies, and former partners, against each other. There's still a long way to go before it's resolved, but here's everything you need to know about what's happened so far. Who's involved? A Waymo self-driving car.waymo.com Waymo. Last year, Google's self-driving car project spun out of X, the Alphabet division that dreams up "moonshot" projects like internet balloons and delivery drones. The new company is called Waymo and licenses its technology to other car companies that want to build self-driving cars. Waymo has already partnered with Fiat Chrysler, however it's a technical partnership. Waymo isn't licensing its technology to Fiat Chrysler. Waymo has also said it plans to work with Honda on self-driving cars. Uber. Uber, the ride-hailing company valued at $69 billion in the private market, is developing self-driving cars, which it believes will one day replace most of its human drivers. Anthony Levandowski. Levandowski is Uber's self-driving car boss. He was a top executive in Google's self-driving car division and left in 2016 to start Otto, a self-driving truck startup. Otto. Otto was bought by Uber last year, a bet by Uber on self-driving cars as well as an effort by the company to expand into the logistics business with self-driving cargo trucks. Waymo's claims Waymo accuses Uber and Otto of stealing its lidar technology. Lidar is the sensor on self-driving cars that allow them to "see" the world as they drive themselves. It's an essential component for self-driving vehicles. Waymo's lawsuit says that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of files containing information about the company's self-driving technology to his laptop and then transferred those files to another external storage device. Those files included plans for Waymo's proprietary lidar system, Waymo says. Levandowski left Google's self-driving division in January of 2016, weeks after downloading the files, Waymo says. He later went on to start Otto, which Uber bought six months later. Levandowski became the head of Uber's self-driving efforts. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick with Anthony Levandowski.Associated Press Waymo says it was accidentally sent an email from one of Uber/Otto's suppliers for lidar equipment late in 2016. The lidar designs in the email "bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique lidar design," Waymo says. This caused Waymo to investigate Levandowski's final weeks at Waymo, and the company says it discovered evidence that he downloaded the files to the external device. In addition to the lawsuit it filed in February, Waymo asked a judge last week to put a ban on Uber's self-driving car projects until the case is resolved. Uber's defense Uber hasn't issued a formal, legal response to Waymo's lawsuit yet, though it is expected to in the coming weeks. However, according to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, we have an idea one of Uber's potential defenses. According to the report, Levandowski told his staff that Uber's lidar technology is "clean" and that he downloaded those files to his computer so that he could work from home. Uber has only called Waymo's accusations a "baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." Alphabet's ties to Uber There's another piece to the puzzle. Alphabet has made significant investments in Uber. In a strange way, Uber's success also financially benefits Alphabet. In 2013, Google Ventures (now simply called GV), invested $258 million in Uber. That investment, which had Uber valued at $3.5 billion at the time, gave GV about a 7% stake in the company, Kara Swisher reported at the time, writing for AllThingsD. Uber is now valued at approximately $69 billion, according to most estimates. An Alphabet executive, David Drummond, also used to be on Uber's board, but left in August of 2016 once it became clear the two companies were competing in the same space. Alphabet's David Drummond left Uber's board in August.Andreas Rentz/Getty Images What's next? The next major development will be Uber's legal filing responding to Waymo's lawsuit. The judge in the case has given Uber until April 7 to file, but Uber's lawyer said it's coming within the next two weeks. So far, we don't know much about how Uber will respond, but it seems likely it'll want to use Levandowski's defense that he downloaded the files to his computer so he could work from home.

Images look better, too. Sebastian Anthony - Mar 17, 2017 11:41 am UTC Enlarge / This image has not been run through Google's new JPEG encoder. But that doesn't make it any less magical. Harry Langdon/Getty Images reader comments 150 Share this story Google has developed and open-sourced a new JPEG algorithm that reduces file size by about 35 percent—or alternatively, image quality can be significantly improved while keeping file size constant. Importantly, and unlike some of its other efforts in image compression (WebP, WebM), Google's new JPEGs are completely compatible with existing browsers, devices, photo editing apps, and the JPEG standard. The new JPEG encoder is called Guetzli, which is Swiss German for cookie (the project was led by Google Research's Zurich office). Don't pay too much attention to the name: after extensive analysis, I can't find anything in the Github repository related to cookies or indeed any other baked good. There are numerous ways of tweaking JPEG image quality and file size, but Guetzli focuses on the quantization stage of compression. Put simply, quantization is a process that tries to reduce a large amount of disordered data, which is hard to compress, into ordered data, which is very easy to compress. In JPEG encoding, this process usually reduces gentle colour gradients to single blocks of colour and often obliterates small details entirely. Further ReadingGoogle AI invents its own cryptographic algorithm; no one knows how it worksThe difficult bit is finding a balance between removing detail, and keeping file size down. Every lossy encoder (libjpeg, x264, lame) does it differently. Guetzli, according to Google Research, uses a new psychovisual model—called Butteraugli, if you must know—to work out which colours and details to keep, and which to throw away. "Psychovisual" in this case means it's based on the human visual processing system. The exact details of Butteraugli are buried within hundreds of high-precision constants, which produce a model that "approximates colour perception and visual masking in a more thorough and detailed way" than other encoders. What we don't know, however, is how Google Research worked out those high-precision constants. They seem to be computer-generated, or at least computer-optimised. Google Research has a thing for neural networks and machine learning: perhaps a huge corpus of images was pushed through a neural net and a more nuanced and accurate psychovisual model came out the other end? Original image on the left, libjpeg in the middle, Guetzli on the right. You can see fewer artifacts in the Guetzli example, and the file size is smaller. Original image on the left, libjpeg in the middle, Guetzli on the right. While the primary use case of Guetzli will be reducing file size, Google Research reckons it can also be used to increase the perceived quality of JPEGs while keeping the file size the same. When comparing Guetzli-encoded images against libjpeg (a popular open-source encoder), "75 percent of ratings are in favour of Guetzli. This implies the Butteraugli psychovisual image similarity metric which guides Guetzli is reasonably close to human perception at high quality levels." Further ReadingGoogle Brain super-resolution image tech makes “zoom, enhance!” a real thingIn any case, the proof of a new algorithm is in the eating. Guetzli is freely available to download from Github. Web masters, graphic designers, and photographers are free to give it a go—or not. It's also worth noting at this point that encoding images with Guetzli, due to the more involved quantization process, is slower than libjpeg. Unlike so many other previous attempts at shaking up image compression, though, at least Guetzli should be compatible with existing browsers and devices. Now read about Google's "zoom, enhance!" algorithm that creates detailed images from tiny, pixelated source images... Sebastian Anthony Sebastian is the editor of Ars Technica UK.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Google has made it official that it will no longer provide Nexus 6 with operating system updates. This was to be expected since the smartphone was launched back in 2014 and Google always tends to leave behind smartphones that have reached their two year milestone. On the bright side though, Google will keep on rolling out security patches to Nexus 6 all throughout 2017. Nexus 6 Receives March Security Patch Usually, when Google starts rolling out its monthly patches the entire Nexus community is happy. Well, this isn’t the case with the March security bulletin. Google’s Product Forum is filled with threads made by Nexus 6 owners who are complaining about the fact that after they updated their security, the smartphone started malfunctioning. March Security Patch Brings Unexpected Bug According to all the aforementioned forum threads, Nexus 6 is no longer able to pass the SafetyNet test. This is quite important since the sole purpose of this test is to make sure if the designated device is secure enough to perform mobile banking or payments. Therefore, Nexus 6 owners are no longer allowed to access Android Pay. Google to Roll Out OTA Fix Although this month’s security patch takes care of 60 system vulnerabilities, Nexus 6 owners are advised to avoid this update. Nexus 6 owners shouldn’t worry if they already managed to update their device. This issue has definitely reached Google’s ears and the Android parent is surely going to roll out an OTA (over the air) fix to all the affected devices. The Android parent has rolled the incremental security update OTA and it arrives under the “N6F62U” build number for Nexus 6 devices. Sadly, even though Google stresses the fact that it puts a high price on security some exploits and bugs such as this one still manage to slip through the cracks. Actually, the March security patch fixes one major exploit which allowed hackers to remotely get access to Android powered smartphones. We can be sure that this type of issues will not happen again in the future. Google always learns from its mistakes and doesn’t repeat them.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Even though Google didn’t unveil any important information about this year’s Pixel lineup, we do know that both of them are going to stay premium. This information was provided by Google’s Senior Vice President Rick Osterloh during the Mobile World Congress. The reason we are talking today about Google’s upcoming smartphones is because their codenames have been unveiled. Google Pixel and Pixel XL have been Codenamed “Walleye” and “Muskie” These two interesting codenames have been spotted on Google’s Android Open Source Project gerrit. However, the gerrit only contained “Walleye”. We should mention that this isn’t the first time the Android parent codenames its devices. The already existing Pixel and Pixel XL used to be known as “Marlin” and “Sailfish”. Additionally, the gerrit only contained Marlin and Sailfish was unveiled later. The codenames leads us to believe that Google is sticking to the two size format. This shouldn’t surprise anyone since both Samsung and Apple have been using the same product format with their Plus variants. Rumor has it that Muskie is the XL Pixel variant and Walleye is the standard model. Google Pixel 2 Rumors and Speculations As previously mentioned, the Android parent has been keeping mouth shut when asked about Pixel 2. However, this didn’t stop the entire Android community from speculating and sparking rumors about Pixel 2. We have gathered the most reoccurring ones and we’re going to list them right now. Speculations are pointing towards the fact that Pixel 2 will also be a camera centric smartphone. This is great news since the already existing model is renowned throughout the entire world for sporting a highly optimized rear camera. Additionally as Rick Osterloh stated, Pixel 2 will stay premium. This means that Google will equip the smartphone with the best hardware parts available on the market. Tech experts believe that Google will use Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 processor. If this proves to be true, the smartphone will be significantly more powerful than its predecessor. Also, rumor has it that Pixel 2 will ship without the classic 3.5mm audio jack. Google will opt for a USB Type-C port instead.

Google Earth is an innovating service that was introduced to the world more than a decade ago. Since then, people have been using Google Earth in a number of ways, learning about the world as it is in real time and exploring places they never thought they’d see. Google has become known over the years as a company you can expect to innovate and refresh the industry thanks to its various services and products that have changed the tech market forever. Just when you though it couldn’t get better, Google returns with a revisited version of Google Earth. Taking advantage of the current virtual reality craze which took the market by storm and stole the show, Google introduced Google Earth VR. Google Earth VR’s name doesn’t leave much room for imagination, and yes, it’s exactly what you think it could be. Through the power of virtual reality, Google is giving people a chance to personally experience being in places around the globe. Through Google VR, people are able to float above the Grand Canyon or walk the streets of Paris. Of course, there’s only so much technology can do, and living the real experience will no doubt be a thousand times better. That being said, the opportunity Google is introducing shouldn’t be dismissed. It can be a great learning tool as well, especially for children. You can imagine conversations between kids and their parents where the child says the learned about the Great Wall of Chine. And the parent replies: “Do you want to go check it out?”. Today, technology has reached a level where it is deeply incorporated into our society and way of life. This allows us to do extraordinary things and enjoy things that weren’t imaginable just a few years ago. As technology continues to evolve, so does society and the opportunities it presents. Through companies like Google which constantly research and innovate, mankind can reach amazing heights.

The most talked about subject in the Android community is March’s Android security bulletin. Even though Google has developed this monthly patch so that Nexus 6’s overall security level is enhanced, Nexus 6 owners soon found out that March’s security bulletin has done something more. After updating the smartphone, Android Pay was automatically disabled on Nexus 6 devices. Android March Security Bulletin Disables Android Pay All Android powered smartphones have to pass the SafetyNet test so that mobile banking and online payments are permitted. Sadly, SafetyNet doesn’t recognize this month’s security patch and sees it as a threat. This is why Nexus 6 owners are not allowed to access Android Pay anymore. Fortunately, this news has reached Google’s ears. Google Isn’t Able to Find a Solution In order to get rid of this issue, Google started rolling out an operating system downgrade to Nexus 6 smartphones. The update brings the designated devices back to the stable public version of Android 7.0 Nougat. On the downside though, it looks like Google has yet to find a solution The Nexus Community manager has even went on Reddit and urged Nexus 6 owners to downgrade their smartphone’s operating system. It doesn’t sound like we are going to see a OTA (over the air) software fix any time soon. Additionally, the Nexus Community manager has also stated that if the device still presents the same issue even after downgrading its operating system, Nexus 6 owners should just perform a factory reset. When can we Expect a Software Fix? Sadly, Google has announced that it’s not able to guarantee to confirm an official date. It’s surprising how this security update managed to mess things up so bad. Even though Google stresses the fact that user security is its top priority, bugs and glitches such as this one still manage to slip through the cracks. Although, taking in consideration the fact that Google has one of the largest developer team we can be sure that a software fix will arrive during the upcoming weeks. Until then, we advise Nexus 6 owners who have yet to upgrade their operating system to just avoid it.

It goes without saying that the word “offensive” is a subjective term that can mean many different things to many different people; what Sally finds offensive may not be offensive to Joe, and vice versa. Because of the term’s lack of definition, it is up to us to give it definition. This is dangerous because it invites people to use the word in a way that best suits their own biases or agendas. Such is the case with the Democratic Party, which has essentially hijacked the word “offensive,” and now uses it to mean anything that comes out of the mouth of a conservative. Americans should be very weary whenever they see a company or an organization announce plans to combat offensive language. Entities, just like individuals, have their own political agendas, and often justify silencing the opposition by claiming to be combating “offensive speech.” Google is the latest corporation to join the fight against “offensive” speech on the Internet. Recently, the multibillion-dollar company directed its review teams to locate and flag language that could potentially be upsetting or offensive. By doing this, Google hopes to improve the overall quality of search results. (RELATED: Read about how Google took action to censor Natural News). If a member of the Google review team decides that one of the search results contains racial slurs, or that it promotes hate or violence in some way, then the content will be flagged under a new “upsetting-offensive” category. While the flagging system doesn’t delete search results completely, it does make it so that “offensive” results are buried and made more difficult to find, whereas search results that are considered to be high quality are more easily accessible. For example, an article about the role the religion of Islam plays in terror attacks may be pushed down and made more difficult to find, while an article about celebrating diversity would be a “quality” search result and found more easily. This, of course, is an extreme example, but you get the point. The review teams that are responsible for judging the quality of the search results are called “quality raters.” These people examine different websites and other content to look for things that are offensive or upsetting, such as pornography. The new feature that Google has added gives these quality raters the ability to list the “offensive content” under the new “upsetting-offensive” category. Thus far, Google has declined to comment on these changes. The “upsetting-offensive” flag reportedly instructs reviewers to “flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent.” In other words, even if the results satisfy what the user was searching for, such as white supremacist websites or anti-Semitic articles, they could still potentially get flagged, even though it still wouldn’t delete the search result entirely. While an excess of propaganda and misinformation circulating the web is not something that should be encouraged, any company that seeks to regulate speech should instantly raise the red flag for supporters of the First Amendment. While it appears that right now Google is only seeking to limit the amount of extreme content out there, such as pornography and white supremacist sites, this new initiative could easily begin infringing on the free speech rights of American citizens, even if it’s speech that is not offensive or upsetting. Despite good intentions, Google may very well have started down a slippery slope. If you are uncomfortable or weary about what Google is doing, sign our petition to let them know that their actions are in violation of the First Amendment’s freedom of speech.

Skim for all the social news you need to know! 1. Has Facebook gone too far with Snapchat clone on Messenger? The cat's out of the bag: Facebook's going to try to copy every successful Snapchat feature across its own platforms. It tackled filters and augmented reality masks by acquiring MSQRD and introduced a near replica of Snacphat Stories on Instagram, and it has now launched Messenger Day—another Snapchat Stories clone—across iOS and Android devices. Zuckerberg once tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion, and it appears Snapchat's wariness triggered a rivalry in which Facebook feels the need to beat the ephemeral messaging app at its own game. But many feel that Messenger Day upended what was a great texting application by adding superfluous buttons and unused features to their home screens. Have you used Messenger Day? What are your thoughts? 2. Google takes on Slack with new communication tools for businesses Google's taking a swipe at Slack with the introduction of two new features to ease collaboration in businesses: Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Hangouts Meet provides an easy way to share links to video conferences without invitees' having to sign up for accounts or download plugins. Hangouts Chat combines searchable, individual chat rooms based on project with threaded conversations, and it also lets bots automatically schedule meetings for your team. Even better? Both new tools are integrated with G Suite, which means all content on Google Drive can be shared effortlessly within the new tools. Hangout Meets is available to all iOS and Android users, and Chat is set to roll out over the next few weeks. 3. LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman joins Microsoft's board Following Microsoft's $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn last year, LinkedIn co-founder Hoffman is officially joining the Microsoft board of directors and will continue focusing primarily on the social network; he will also help Microsoft expand its connections in Silicon Valley. Hoffman gave a glimpse at what could be the future of LinkedIn, given its new family at Microsoft, citing how Microsoft-powered intelligent assistant Cortana could help users decide which third-degree connections on LinkedIn make the most sense to reach out to, or how Microsoft's HoloLens virtual reality gear could make LinkedIn Learning courses more immersive. The future seems bright, according to Hoffman, so stay tuned. 4. Pinterest just lost access to 1.3 billion people The People's Republic of China has found something wrong with what's potentially the least controversial social network out there: Pinterest. The Great Fire Wall, as China's Internet censorship system is referred to, has made the social network inaccessible for over one week now. Conjecture suggests the blackout might be due to the "Two Sessions" meeting of China's governing classes that's currently taking place in Beijing, but it's impossible to know for certain what's caused Pinterest—one of the last American social networks accessible in China—to be taken offline. 5. How to use Facebook Messenger Day for marketing If your company already uses Messenger to communicate with customers, we've got some top tips to showcase how it can use its newest feature—Messenger Day—to expand and optimize marketing on the platform. Though Messenger Day functions much like Snapchat Stories, there are a few peculiarities that might make Messenger Day worthwhile for your marketing team. Because Messenger is available only for individual users and not (usually company) Pages, the new feature could be used strategically to spread employee-generated content in a way that builds brand awareness and expands your client base. For now, content will be coming from employees' profiles, so while Messenger Day could also be used to share news and images, and encourage users to follow your other social profiles, efforts should be focused on driving awareness and relationship-building.

Seven steps to better customer service on social media If you don't yet generate many leads via social, that doesn't mean the channel can't serve other needs, such as answering consumers' questions and providing customer service. Social platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, seem to be constantly innovating to provide companies with new and better ways to communicate with customers, so why not take advantage? Doing so effectively, however, requires some preparation. From educating customers about how to get in touch and investing in the right platforms, to humanizing your messaging and connecting your data streams to complete customer profiles, Kristin Shevis of Conversocial suggests seven key steps to owning customer service on social media. 7. The key to YouTube's six-second bumper ads YouTube might be just the place for your brand to raise awareness and generate new leads, but as time goes on the social network has reworked its ad formats in a way that might now seem foreign—or impossible—for your brand to convey its message. Thorough testing and a decidedly better consumer experience means the platform's new six-second bumper ads appear here to stay, but how can your company make the most out of such a short format without fumbling? Some might try to fit everything they've got into six short seconds, but success requires a more thoughtful approach. From breaking thing down to individual elements, to employing emotion or comedy, Andrew Wohlwend of Zefr presentsthe keys to a successful six-second ad. Get your creative juices flowing with the example ads below! 8. After overreach, Facebook and Instagram bar developers from using data for surveillance Following revelations that police gained special access to the two social networks to track protest movements for Black Lives Matter, the two social networks rewrote their privacy policy to ban developers from using the platforms' data for surveillance purposes. Police gained access via controversial developer, Geofeedia, which partnered with law enforcement to track streams of user content. The American Civil Liberties Union obtained documents proving the connection last year, and it is now pushing social networks to take a strong stance on human rights to avoid similar missteps in the future. Social media might just be the next frontier for civil liberty battles after all. 9. YouTube launches an experimental app for watching videos with friends Dubbed "Uptime," the new app from Google's YouTube aims to make video viewing a more social experience by encourage friends to watch—and react—together. In the app, users' profile photos float alongside the video (mostly vertical in format) they're currently viewing, and they can comment or react with emojis that can be seen live or after-the-fact by friends that watch the same content. Available only on iOS for now, Uptime wants to encourage a co-viewing experience for video; videos on YouTube can be searched and then shared from within the application. The app is currently invite only, but checking out Uptime's Twitter feed gets you the golden ticket via an invite code, so go give it a shot! Short video of what #Uptime is all about. ?? ??

Reddit's getting hot as it positions to counterbalance fake news—and Facebook Remarkable election and referendum results in 2016 prompted many to ask whether social media was creating an echo chamber that shielded users from opposing points of view and simply reinforced the worldview of their "friends". Reddit—280 million active users strong—thinks it can destroy that echo chamber. The social network, long a minefield for brands because of some of its users anti-advertising sentiment, lets users post links that are then simply upvoted or downvoted, leaving out the social connection factor of people choosing who to follow. The small feel of the social network is becoming an attractive place for brands, and it might just force us to be exposed to new points of views that could change the game. 11. We'll wrap up with a way to take on clickbait like you've never seen On National Read a Book Day, one bookstore in Texas took a novel approach to tricking Facebook users into reading copyright-free classics: It used a superb play on clickbait—or "Litbait," as the bookstore calls it. Users fell for clickbait-like titles of Facebook articles that were actually descriptions of literary classics, such as Romeo & Juliet. They were then redirected to the entirety of the selected copyright-free novel, online. Former #SocialSkim columnist Angela Natividad has the scoop from cover to cover in Adage, highlighting how originality on social media can serve not only a cause but also your brand: The bookstore's website had a massive traffic increase in traffic, as well as Facebook engagement.

Android O Could Feature Notification Revamp and Picture-in-Picture GO The new Android version will bring multiple changes Mar 18, 2017 15:27 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is said to offer a first glimpse at Android O during the Google I/O conference, set to take place in May. Until then, new information about the upcoming OS version continues to surface online, the latest referring to changes regarding notifications. Apparently, Google intends to bring lots of changes to notifications in Android O, including app icon badges for notifications. This would mean that each notification would carry the app icon, and users would be able to get a quick glance at how many notifications they have for any given app simply by looking at the home screen. In addition, 9to5Google stated that Android O could come with a completely redesigned notification system, but that remains to be seen. Google might also include a picture-in-picture mode just like on Android TV. Moreover, Google might be working on a smart text selection floating toolbar with Assistant integration. The feature would automatically copy relevant information from apps and surface it when needed. The “Copy Less” feature was mentioned in an earlier report, stating that it would include integration with Google Assistant. Restricted background activities from apps and dynamically changing icons Google might also bring the restricted background activities from apps feature to Android O. The tool is currently found in Chrome 57 and it allows users to reduce power consumption of background tabs, so that battery life would be optimized. The stricter throttling tool in Chrome 57 can result in 25% less power consumption. Dynamically changing icons is another feature revealed in the report, a feature that is currently found in the Pixel Launcher for Google Pixel smartphones. Furthermore, Google may intend to bring lots of improvements to MediaRecorder API, which allows apps to capture audio and video in order to save data to persistent storage. Moreover, improvements could also be brought to enterprise features and audio latency. Take this information with a grain of salt for now, and we’ll just have to wait and see what Google has in store for Android O. When it comes to the name of the upcoming version, some have hinted towards Android Oreo, but it’s simply too early to say for sure. #Google#Android O#Notifications#Dynamic icons#Google Assistant subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant Will Not Be Pushed to Android Tablets Google Introduces Family Link App with Parental Controls Google May Have a Third Smartphone in the Works Under Codename “Taimen” Google Reportedly Downgrading Nexus 6 Phones to Android 7.0 Nougat (from 7.1) Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Build 15063 for PC and Mobile YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed 7 Tips to Stay Safe from Attacks like the Fappening Here’s Another Windows Phone App You Must Say Goodbye to New Instagram Update Allows Users to Save Live Videos Dutch Police Buys Unnecessary Microsoft Office Licenses by Mistake… Twice Google Releases Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta 2 for Nexus and Pixel    Google I/O new android apps Psiphon Pro APK: Updated March 20th, 16:23 GMT Terrarium TV APK: Updated March 20th, 16:14 GMT Lyft APK: Updated March 20th, 16:10 GMT Waze APK: Updated March 20th, 16:07 GMT Assassin's Creed Pirates APK: Updated March 20th, 14:12 GMT Just Dance Now APK: Updated March 20th, 14:05 GMT Trials Frontier APK: Updated March 20th, 13:58 GMT Reader comments Facebook Tests New “Start Exploring” Section with Trending Posts more on: Facebook i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The new Connected Modular 45 timepiece uses an Intel SoC, runs Google’s Android Wear 2.0, and is listed with 'expanded functionality'. Tag Heuer will also offer a variety of customization options for the new smartwatch and aim to address different market segments with the new product. Furthermore, the watchmaker says that the Connected Modular 45 design could easily fit a mechanical module and be converted into a regular timepiece. Tag Heuer, Google and Intel formally introduced their first-gen connected smartwatch in late-2015. The wristwatch was the first device of the kind for Tag Heuer and for Intel, and so it was largely a test vehicle for both of them. As it turned out, the Tag Heuer Connected was considered a success by its developers and with the second generation they decided to install a more capable computing platform, a better display and introduce customizable design options. The use of Google Android Wear 2.0 should expand the overall functionality of the new smartwatch, in order to offer more features. Tag Heuer will offer different configurations of the Connected Modular 45: 11 standard versions available in retail and additional configurations upon request. Each timepiece consists of three key elements which users can mix and match: the watch module, the lugs, and the strap. All watch modules are made of grade 5 titanium 5 with a sand-blasted satin finish (of a chosen color), but users can choose bezels of different colors made of ceramic, gold, aluminum, titanium, and even covered with diamonds. The lugs can match the bezels and thus can be made of aluminum, titanium, ceramic and so on. Finally, the manufacturer will offer a variety of straps featuring different colors (black, brown, red, green, etc.) made of calfskin, rubber, ceramic or titanium. The central piece of the Connected Modular 45 is, of course, the watch module. The latter is based on the Intel Atom Z3400-series SoC (Merrifield, two Silvermont cores, 1 MB cache) equipped with 512 MB of LPDDR3 memory (down from 1 GB in the previous-gen model) and 4 GB of NAND flash memory. The device comes with a wireless module featuring Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC as well as a host of sensors, including an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a tilt detection sensor and an ambient light sensor. In addition, the module has a water-resistant microphone and a vibration/haptics engine, but no speaker. The most notable upgrade of the new Tag Heuer smartwatch is the new 1.39” AMOLED display, with a 400×400 resolution and 287 PPI, which is higher than many competing wearable devices. The display is covered with a 2.5-mm sapphire glass, just like many Swiss-made watches. As for the battery, the manufacturer states that it has a capacity of 410 mAh and claims it can last for up to 25 hours. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Processor Intel Atom Z3400-series 2×Silvermont PowerVR G6400 GPU RAM 512 MB LPDDR3 Storage 4GB eMMC NAND flash Display 1.39" AMOLED 400×400 resolution 287 PPI pixel density 2-point touch Display Protection 2.5-mm Sapphire Glass Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Wi-Fi NFC GPS Sensors accelerometer gyroscope tilt detection sensor ambient light sensor Battery 410 mAh Battery life: 25 hours Charging Magnetic charging cable Water Resistance 50 meters/50 atmosphere Color Black, titanium, aluminum, gold, diamond, etc. Strap Rubber, leather, ceramic, titanium Dimensions Diameter: ≦ 45 mm Height: 13.75 mm Inputs One button, touchscreen Operating System Google Android Wear 2.0 with phone application by Tag Heuer Compatibility Google Android 4.3+ Apple iOS 9+ Price Starts at €1600/$1650 All the Connected Modular 45 watch modules are 50 meters water resistant, just like mechanical watches by Tag Heuer. Now, speaking of mechanics, when someone buys the Connected Modular 45, they can easily switch the smartwatch module with a mechanical watch module that Tag Heuer offers: a moderately-priced Swiss mechanical movement module with 3 hands (calibre 5) or an expensive COSC-certified chronograph Tourbillon Heuer 02-T. Both are also water resistant. One of the things that Tag Heuer has learnt since the launch of the original Connected smartwatch is that there is a market for premium smartwatches. As a result, the Connected Modular 45 will be available at different price points depending on their external finish. The starting price of the smartwatch is $1650/€1600/£1400, but when fully beefed up with diamonds, their price increases to around $7000. Additionally, Tag Heuer offers the so-called Deluxe Box Set that includes one Connected Modular 45 (in grade 5 titanium, with titanium lugs and brown natural leather strap) and one chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module for a total price of €16,650/$17,000 (ex. tax). Both electronics and mechanical modules come with a two-year warranty. Sources: Tag Heuer, Google, Intel.

POST A COMMENT 33 Comments View All Comments yeeeeman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link Hmm, if you have money falling off your pocket you can choose this watch. But maybe there is a better way to get this kind of watch, I mean, really the exact same capabilities with less money? Here you go http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watch-phone/pp_57617... . Same display (AMOLED, 1.39 inch 400x400), bigger battery (450mAh), metal case (you don't really need titanium, you will die before this watch is destroyed), full android experience - you can install everything you like, quad core CPU (compared to two Intel Silvermont), 1GB of RAM compared to 512, 8GB of storage compared to 4GB, SIM support compared to...nothing. Shall I continue? The only thing missing on the Finow X5 plus compared to this watch is the missing Tag Heuer badge which....can be engraved easily. Reply mjeffer - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link This is aimed at people who buy luxury watches and they would have zero interest in buying that one you linked. This is for a niche market and for that market this price is right in line. Reply shabby - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link There's nothing luxurious about this watch, its a regular smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it, it will drop in value as soon as you put it on your wrist... meaning its not a luxury watch at all. Reply eddman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link "smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it" ...which is the whole point. Rich people buy brands. That's the most important thing to them. Specs might be important to some extent but are secondary for them. Reply geekman1024 - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link well, this watch and that one which yeeeeman linked, might be manufactured by the same Chinese factory....if that's the case, that will be a rather sad and funny ironic. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link It's stereotypical to say wealthy people care about branding. I'd argue to the contrary. People who have wealth are more effective money managers that understand the value of things and take into account product specifications, value for the cost, brand prestige, AND (something you forgot which is most important) the usefulness of a particular purchase. These trinkets are more for the upper middle class sorts that are trying to demonstrate wealth, but are actually not exactly above the masses of working class they're trying to escape. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link I have to disagree with this. There are some wealthy people who are concerned with specifications and performance, but "most" wealthy people cannot be bothered to research items they are purchasing. Half the time they have an assistant who will be doing the purchasing for them, and the other half just buys whatever their friends have or whatever is most expensive. Truly wealthy people don't have time to sit down for a couple hours researching each purpose. They just tell their assistant "I need a new watch, get me a new Rolex and make it a good one" or something to that effect. We all probably have our own unique experiences with the wealthy that might guide our understanding, but my personal example would be my uncle in-law. The man is worth a few hundred million dollars, and all he cares about is prestige and appearance. He only buys/drives Mercedes "because it's a Mercedes", his watch is a Rolex, the list goes on and on. He doesn't know the first thing about tech, but he knows that "Apple is the best" so whatever is Apple, he buys. That doesn't make him dumb, the man is a brain surgeon and a lung surgeon, he is a brilliant man. He just doesn't have time to research "toys" which is what stuff like this is to the wealthy. It's one more watch to add to their collection. Nothing more. Reply boozed - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link That is how luxury brands like Tag Heuer operate. In the case of its mechanical watches, they're generally lightly modified off-the-shelf movements (e.g. ETA, Sellita) surrounded by a bunch of marketing. It's not so much about the value proposition. Reply yeeeeman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link I fully agree with what you said, just wanted to show how outrageous this offer is. Reply Murloc - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link titanium is about weight not durability.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Opinions There’s never going to be an iPhone killer Image Source: Vianney le Masne Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 17th, 2017 at 12:28 PM Share Tweet Per usual, Apple finds itself in the crosshairs of armchair critics who lazily demand that Apple needs to come up with the next big thing lest it enter a period of stagnation. All the while, other tech companies never seem to grapple with similar demands from analysts and pundits. Whereas Apple needs to outdo the iPhone, we never hear calls for Facebook to come up with a social network killer or for Google to come up with a product that will obsolete the search engine. Don't Miss: Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish The iPhone’s 10th anniversary earlier this year sparked a number of opinion pieces proclaiming that the iPhone has peaked and that it’s time for Apple to deliver an iPhone killer, a futuristic device that will obsolete the iPhone in the same way that Apple’s iconic smartphone quickly rendered the iPod outdated. Writing for Wired, Davey Alba opined that the iPhone — of all things — is actually slowing Apple down and that the company must figure out what’s next. Now Apple is facing a turning point, and once again the iPhone is the reason—but not in a good way this time around. The smartphone market is saturated. Rivals, especially Google, are building hardware that truly rivals the iPhone. After 10 years, the iPhone can no longer serve as Apple’s growth engine. The company now faces the same challenge it did a decade ago: figuring out what’s next. It’s not an unfair point, but it conveniently overlooks the fact that Apple has become rather adept at extracting more dollars from existing iPhone owners via its burgeoning suite of services. Whether it’s the App Store — which recorded its most profitable day in company history not too long ago — or the growing popularity of Apple Music, Apple has figured out a few ways to pad its bottom line even as iPhone sales growth did an about-face this past year. Meanwhile, a piece in Forbes from earlier this year took an even bolder position, arguing that Apple must build an iPhone killer. Which means it’s time for Apple to kill the iPhone…not in one fell swoop, of course, and not as the intended goal… No matter how innovative your product or service once was, sticking to incrementalism in order to most efficiency milk the maximum amount of revenue out of it is a losing proposition. As your incremental change curve flattens out, the development that will [obsolete you] will be disappearing in your windshield before… you ever noticed it approaching in your rear-view mirror. It’s time for Apple to build the iPhone killer. The only problem is that doing so is impossible. The original iPhone was a revolutionary device that quickly transformed the smartphone into an indispensable part of the way we live. And because its functionality is wildly expansive and limited only by the imagination of third-party developers, it’s utility isn’t artificially stunted in the way that the iPod’s was. The smartphone in general, and the iPhone in particular, isn’t going anywhere because it functions as a portal of sorts; its utility is always expanding as its hardware improves and new software is developed. Looking ahead, for example, the upcoming iPhone 8 is said to feature advanced augmented reality functionality that may very well transform the way we use our smartphones. The fact of the matter is that some products become so entrenched in our everyday lives that the notion of killing them off simply isn’t realistic. Notice how we never hear calls for anyone to develop a TV killer or for Google to develop search engine killer. Truly revolutionary products and technologies have extremely long shelf lives that can’t be obsoleted on an arbitrary time frame. The iPod’s demise at the hands of the iPhone was an exception, not the rule. Put simply, the iPhone isn’t going anywhere no matter what type of product area Apple opts to enter. Curiously, some people have even argued that a more advanced version of the Apple Watch might eventually replace the iPhone. These claims, I believe, completely overlook the fact that a big and easily accessible smartphone display can never be replaced by even the most intuitive software on a watch or a pair of AR glasses. Point being, there’s never going to be an iPhone killer, only new and advanced iPhones that render previous models obsolete. Having said that, Apple still doesn’t seem to get the credit it deserves for continually rolling out, with absolutely no aberration, impressive advances in iPhone technology year after year. From huge leaps in hardware performance to incredible improvements in camera technology, Apple has managed to steadily and substantially improve the iPhone user experience every single year for 9 years running. And with the iPhone 8 looming on the horizon, the next leap in performance and design may be the biggest one yet. Just last quarter, Apple posted a new quarterly record for iPhone sales. And yet, for reasons that defy explanation, some pundits would have you believe that Apple is in dire straits and desperately in need of rolling out an iPhone killer.

By Oli Gamp March 18, 2017 15:07 GMT Close Record number of anti-Semitic incidents blamed on ‘mood of racism’ in UK following Brexit IBTimes UK Google is under pressure for its alleged failure to remove anti-semitic videos from its YouTube platform after hundreds of brands were pulled out of its advertising network by agency Havas. An investigation by the Times found that major companies and taxpayers were unknowingly funding extremists through advertising, with videos receiving $7.60 (£6.10) per 1,000 views of an advert. Some 200 offending videos were reportedly found on YouTube, including titles such as "Adolf Hitler vs The Jew World Order", which attempts to debunk beliefs that the Holocaust took place and whose owner described the video platform as "JewTube". Other videos, including some helmed by David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, cite stereotyped theories that Jews control the world's banks and start wars for profit. One particular video alleged that Jews killed non-Jewish children on Passover and sold their bodies to McDonalds to be used as burger meat. It gained over a million views – enough to generate around £5,600 in advertising revenue to the individual behind it. A Google representative said it allowed people to express their views freely, but would not allow videos that spread or incite hate. "Google believes in the right for people to express views that we and many others find abhorrent, but we do not tolerate hate speech," said a spokeswoman. "We have clear policies against inciting violence or hatred and we remove content that breaks our rules or is illegal when we're made aware of it." Google's policy states: "We don't permit hate speech. [It is not] acceptable to post malicious, hateful comments about a group of people solely based on their race." The tech giant says it cannot monitor every video posted to YouTube, due to the sheer quantity – between 100-300 hours of video are posted to the site every minute – and so it relies on the public to report offensive videos. Google signed a European Commission code of conduct last year, which implores them to take down items flagged as hate speech within 24 hours, but it allegedly failed to take down six videos that were reported to them by the Times within that period.

Last week, Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet, predicted that future wars will be fought over claims to large datasets. "Big data is so powerful that nation states will fight over how much data matters," he told the Google Cloud Next conference. Dr. Andrej Zwitter, Professor of Ethics and International Politics at the University of Groningen and founder of the International Network Observatory, a think-tank, told Radio Sputnik that big data could actually be used to prevent wars, if there was enough political will to do so. "The problem of predicting wars is not so much a problem of big data. We've been making huge advances in conflict studies since the 70s and are relatively good at predicting conflicts. We're not so good at predicting the triggers of conflicts, when exactly they happen." "But even when we can do that, for example what we learned during the genocide in Rwanda, is that it is not only about being able to predict the conflict but also the political willingness, the investment in political freedoms and development that can prevent war." © Photo: Pixabay Will Future Wars Be Waged Over Big Data?"Only once actual conflicts happen are we really willing to intervene and that is usually too late," Zwitter said. One of the key tools for the development of data is machine learning, in which computers learn to manipulate large datasets. "As a sub-field of AI, machine learning is definitely one of the elements, such as pattern recognition and object recognition, in order to make sense of the different formats that we face in big data, such as pictures, videos, text messages. So indeed, machine learning will be one of the big disruptors of big data in the future," Zwitter said. Have you heard the news? Sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed!  ...

 Why this Google engineer gave up on Silicon Valley and moved back to India Julie Bort Mar. 18, 2017, 10:00 AM 91,040 facebook linkedin twitter email print Nupur Dave Nupur Dave By all accounts, including her own, Nupur Dave had the dream life. A native of India, she had spent the past decade living in the US. She was working at Google at the perk-filled "Googleplex" headquarters in Mountain View, California, at a job she loved. And she had obtained permanent residence, her green card. She was a program manager for a part of Google called Network Content Distribution, the network tech that makes Google run faster (in geek speak: it's Google's homegrown alternative to a content distribution network like Akamai). And the opportunities for promotion were plentiful. "I got to travel all over the world, attend conferences," she told Business Insider."It was great. The team was great. It was really good job." There was just one problem. She was growing increasingly unhappy with this Silicon Valley dream life. Expensive and lonely For one thing, the cost of living was a hardship. While she was paid well, it wasn't enough to get ahead in the costly Bay Area, much less buy a house. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The idea that all Googlers are wealthy is a "myth," she told Business Insider. While a highly specialized software engineer or a high performance manager are definitely well compensated (some of them make seven figures between pay and stock), for many rank-and-file Google employees, "Google is a medium payer," she said. For instance, salaries for a technical program manager at Google range from $93,837 to $176,500, according to Glassdoor. While that's not chicken scratch, when you factor in what it costs to live in the Valley, those salaries don't go far. "I always rented," she said, and she often had a roommate, too. But money wasn't her main problem: loneliness was worse. She missed her family in India. She missed her home country. She was single. Working long hours for Google made it hard to meet someone and have a relationship, she said. And while there is social prestige in the Valley attached to being at Google, it also intimidated some men, she felt. She became very involved with the Indian Google Network. Google has a large contingent of India ex-pats (including CEO Sundar Pichai) in Mountain View, and the Indian network is one of many Google diversity groups. Henry Blodget / Business Insider "I founded the Women’s Cricket team at Google. And with the India Google network, I organized a lot of events. I had a life. I really had a lot of friends, I’m a very social person," she said. It didn't stop that nagging feeling, though. At one point, Dave tried shaking up her life by moving to the trendy city of San Francisco. Walk everywhere. Great food. Gorgeous views.  But that soon became exhausting. She wound up with a three-hour commute, getting home each night at 8:30 p.m. She hired help from TaskRabbit to do the cleaning and the chores. But her rent was higher, as were other costs, and she couldn't afford it at the level that she needed. "I was becoming sadder and sadder," she said. The exhaustion of living in San Francisco also meant less time to do her hobby, writing and photography for her recipe blog. Then, during a visit home for her cousin's wedding, she was talking with her 8-year-old nephew who asked her why she lived in America. The only answer she could think of was, "Because my job is good."  Less pay, more ... everything Was she really living for a job? Could she have both? A life near her family in India and Google?She searched for and landed a Google job in India of parallel responsibility as a Technical Program Manager for Google For Work. But it involved a big pay cut.  Allison Joyce/Getty Images She didn't decide to take it until she had a conversation with a stranger on a plane ride who happened to be a PhD from MIT in economics and a law professor. He told her the Google India job could have a big and helpful economic impact for her home country. And the salary was enough for her to buy her own house in India. It's now been seven months and she says she's way happier. "My stress levels have been reduced to one tenth what they were. I used to sleep for 5 hours a night in the U.S. In India, I sleep for 8 hours now," she says. She wrote a post about leaving America for India that went viral on LinkedIn and has since received thousands of messages from people. Her advice to other U.S. immigrants is "don’t torture yourself" but to "trust your gut." It will tell you if the U.S. is your true home, or if it "is not your destiny."  Get the latest Google stock price here.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) faq, Google Google Data Center FAQ by Data Center Knowledge  on March 16, 2017 1 comment Tweet Google is the largest, most-used search engine in the world, with a global market share that has held steady at about 90 percent since Google Search launched in 1997 as Backrub. In 2017, Google became the most valuable brand in the world, topping Apple, according to the Brand Finance Global 500 report. Google’s position is due mainly to its core business as a search engine and its ability to transform users into payers via advertising. About 32 percent of Google visitors come from the US, where the company holds 63.9 percent of the search engine market, according to statista.com. Google had 247 million unique US users in November 2015. Globally, it boasts 1.5 billion search engine users and more than 1 billion users of Gmail. Google data centers process an average of 40 million searches per second, resulting in 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year, Internet Live Stats reports. That’s up from 795.2 million searcher per year in 1999, one year after Google was launched.

In a reorganization in October 2015, Google became a subsidiary of a new company it created called Alphabet. Since then, several projects have been canceled or scaled back, including the halt of further rollout of Google Fiber. Following the reorg, however, Google has placed a lot of focus (and dedicated a lot of resources) to selling cloud services to enterprises, going head-to-head against the market giant Amazon Web Services and the second-largest player in the space, Microsoft Azure. That has meant a major expansion of Google data centers specifically to support those cloud services. At the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March 2017, the company’s execs revealed that it spent nearly $30 billion on data centers over the preceding three years. While the company already has what is probably the world’s largest cloud, it was not built to support enterprise cloud services. To do that, the company needs to have data centers in more locations, and that’s what it has been doing, adding new locations to support cloud services and adding cloud data center capacity wherever it makes sense in existing locations. The largest of several murals illustrator Fuchsia MacAree painted on the walls of Google’s data center in Dublin (Photo: Google) Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about Google data centers and our best stab at answering them: Where are Google Data Centers Located? Google lists eight data center locations in the U.S., one in South America, four in Europe and two in Asia. Its cloud sites, however, are expanding, and Google’s cloud map shows many points of presence worldwide. The company also has many caching sites in colocation facilities throughout the world, whose locations it does not share. This far-flung network is necessary not only to support operations than run 24/7, but to meet specific regulations (like the EU’s privacy regulations) of certain regions and to ensure business continuity in the face of risks like natural disasters. Google data centers in the Dalles, Oregon, 2006 (Photo by Craig Mitchelldyer/Getty Images) In the works as of March 2017, are Google data centers for cloud services in California, Canada, The Netherlands, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney. Here are the data center sites listed by Google: North America: Berkeley County, South Carolina Council Bluffs, Iowa Douglas County, Georgia Jackson County, Alabama Lenoir, North Carolina Mayes County, Oklahoma Montgomery County, Tennessee The Dalles, Oregon South America Quilicura, Chile Asia Changhua County, Taiwan Singapore Europe Dublin, Ireland Eemshaven, Netherlands Hamina, Finland St Ghislain, Belgium How Big are Google Data Centers? A paper presented during the IEEE 802.3bs Task Force in May 2014 estimates the size of five of Google’s US facilities as: Pryor Creek (Mayes County), Oklahoma , 980,000 square feet Lenoir, North Carolina, 337,000 square feet The Dalles, Oregon, 200,000 square feet (before the 2016, 164,000 square foot expansion) Council Bluff, Iowa, 200,000 square feet Berkely County, South Carolina, 200,000 square feet. Many of these sites have multiple data center buildings, as Google prefers to build additional structures as sites expand rather than containing operations in a single massive building. Google itself doesn’t disclose the size of its data centers. Instead, it mentions the cost of the sites or number of employees. Sometimes, facility size slips out. For example, the announcement about the opening of The Dalles in Oregon said the initial building was 164,000 square feet. The size of subsequent expansions, however, has been kept tightly under wraps. Reports discussing Google’s new data center in Emeshaven, Netherlands, which opened December 2016, didn’t mention size. Instead, they said the company has contracted for the entire 62 Megawatt output of a nearby windfarm and ran 9,941 miles of computer cable within the facility. The data center employs 150 people. How Many Servers Does Google Have? There’s no official data on how many servers there are in Google data centers, but Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. This number, of course, is always changing as the company expands capacity and refreshes its hardware.   1 | 2 | 3 Previous Article Google Opens a New Front in Cloud Price Wars Next Article Everything You Wanted to Know about Google Data Centers Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

A Google spokesperson told The Star Tribune on Friday that the company will go to court, if necessary, to fight the warrant, which was issued by Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson in early February. Read more Google’s message app Allo overshares data with friends “We will continue to object to this overreaching request for user data, and if needed, will fight it in court. We always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users,” the Google representative said. The warrant would let police demand information on anyone in the entire city of Edina who searched the victim’s name between December 1, 2016 and January 7, 2017. The information Google would be forced to provide includes, but is not limited to, contact information, date of birth, social security numbers, account and payment information, and IP (internet protocol) and MAC (media access control) addresses. On January 7, 2017, two SPIRE Credit Union account holders reported that $28,500 had been stolen from a line of credit associated with one of their accounts, according to court documents. The Edina Police Department determined that the suspect had provided the credit union with the account holder’s name, date of birth, and social security number, and also faxed a copy of a forged US passport that looked similar to that of the account holder. Police believe the suspect used Google to acquire the image, as investigators did not find the photo in searches conducted using other search engines. The warrant notes that Google had rejected an administrative subpoena that sought subscriber information on anyone who had searched the victim’s name. A public records researcher named Tony Webster first unearthed details about the warrant, whose breadth has prompted serious concerns among privacy law experts. Google confirmed to the Star Tribune they objected to the Edina search warrant, will fight in court if necessary. https://t.co/tfz358D0YHpic.twitter.com/p2iGdXs2Em— Tony Webster (@webster) March 18, 2017 Holy shit.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s a mysterious new Google phone in the works and it isn’t the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL Image Source: Marques Brownlee, YouTube Zach Epstein @zacharye March 16th, 2017 at 11:25 AM Share Tweet Get ready, Android fans, because it looks like Google is going all-in on its emerging phone business. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones might not have been the best-selling Android handsets of 2016, but there’s precious little question that they were among the best and most desirable new handsets of the year. In fact, they’re still the best new Android phones you can buy right now, and that will continue to be the case until the LG G6, Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ all launch next month. Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL actually would have sold far better than they have so far if not for manufacturing issues that have left Google and its ODM partner HTC completely unable to keep up with demand. Android fans love the idea of getting premium smartphones directly from Google that will always run the latest available version of Android. Of course, Google is planning to follow up its Pixel and Pixel XL with two second-generation models later this year, and the company recently confirmed as much. Interestingly, however, it looks like there’s a third new Google smartphone in the works and it may have just been uncovered for the first time. Don't Miss: Warning: Dangerous new Gmail phishing attack can easily steal your Google login Google and Android news blog Droid Life has learned from multiple unnamed sources that Google is working on not two but three new smartphones right now. The first two are the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, which are known internally at Google as the “muskie” and “walleye.” Android fans will recall that Google’s internal hardware codenames tend to be sea creatures — the original Pixel and Pixel XL were known internally as “sailfish” and “marlin.” Next-generation Pixel codenames are good to know, but we’ve known about the muskie and walleye for a while now. The interesting part of the blog’s report is the existence of a third new smartphone that is said to be codenamed “taimen.” The blog’s sources insist that the codename refers to a new smartphone that is in development at Google, and the device apparently might not fall into the Pixel family. The only other detail worth noting in the report is that the taimen is said to be a very large device — which makes sense when you consider that taimen are very large fish in the salmon family — and that it may be even larger than the Pixel 2 XL. How big is it? What are the phone’s key features? When will it be released? The answers to these questions and more remain a mystery, but hopefully not for long now that the phone’s existence has been revealed.

As environmental issues take the center stage, alternative clean energy sources such as solar energy are gaining traction. And Google isn't one to pass off a promising opportunity. Having started the project in August 2015, Google sees this avenue as providing it with the leeway to leverage its expansive data in mapping and computing resources to help calculate the best solar plan for consumers. Founded by Google engineer Carl Elkin, the project's stated purpose is "mapping the planet's solar potential, one roof at a time." Solar Potential Joel Conkling, the product manager overseeing Google's solar initiative, outlined the insights the company gained through the analysis of 60 million buildings nationwide in a March 1 blog post. These were the findings in nutshell: 79 percent of all rooftops assessed were technically viable or had an unshaded area for setting up solar panels. The viability percentage varies between states, with Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico having the highest viability of over 90 percent. However, states like Pennsylvania, Maine and Minnesota have just above 60 percent viability. Among cities, Houston, Texas ranked high in solar potential, with an estimated 18,940 gigawatt-hours of solar generation potential per year. The other cities which follow Houston included Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio and New York. Based on the EIA estimate of an average power requirement of 10,812 kilowatt-hours per year for an average U.S. home, Google said if the top 10 cities in terms of solar potential attain their full potential, the power generated would power 8 million homes across the U.S. Conkling's blog also outlined the usage of data explorer tools for consumers to deduce rooftop solar potential across U.S. zip codes, cities, counties and states. And for those looking to calculate solar and financial savings potential, Google launched the Project Sunroof savings estimator tool in 2015. Using a single sample address in Massachusetts, Google estimated that the building has 1,479 hours of usable sunlight per year (arrived at by day-to-day analysis of weather patterns) and 497 square feet available for solar models (based on 3-D modelling of roof and nearby areas). The company estimates net savings of $18,000 for the household over 20 years. Consumer Solar An Attractive Opportunity Estimates by the Solar Energy Industry Association show that the U.S. installed 14,800 megawatts of solar PV in 2016, with the total installed capacity now at 42.4 gigawatts — enough to power 8.3 million homes. The association estimates the industry will nearly triple over the next five years. GTM Research expects the residential segment to rise 9 percent year-over-year in 2017. This follows a 19 percent increase in 2016, which saw a slowdown from the scorching pace in 2015, which benefited from the emergence of several new state markets. Source: GTM Research / SEIA U.S. Solar Market Insight report California, which accounts for about half of the U.S. residential market, is projected to see a decline, while the rest of the 36 states are projected to have year-over-year growth. Data from Energy Sage lists SolarCity Corp, which is now part of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Vivint Solar Inc (NYSE: VSLR) among companies that are significant players in the residential solar energy space. With Google's consumer solar drive, the residential market could see a renewed thrust. Growth could pick up from the lackluster rate seen now, as more and more people warm to this technology and other factors driving growth, such as government support and financing.

We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network,” he promised Read more Extremists make money off taxpayer funded YouTube ads The pledge comes after several prominent advertisers announced that they would suspend online advertising with Google because of the risk that their ads could appear alongside inappropriate content. The biggest is Havas of France, the world’s sixth largest marketing services group, which said Google had been “unable to provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters.” The BBC, the Guardian, and Transport for London took similar steps. The pullout comes after an expose in the Times revealed that Google had displayed the ads on some extremist sites, as well as alongside extremist videos posted on YouTube, the tech giant’s video service. The British government has summoned Google executives to explain why taxpayer money ended up funding publishers of inappropriate content via the ads. In his blog post, Harris argued that Google’s automated algorithms fail to prevent such incidents only in rare cases.

We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.” Britain is not the only nation where tech giants face criticism for inadequately policing their content. Germany announced plans this week to pass a law that would require social networks to publish quarterly accountability reports on how they are fighting hate speech and fake news. Companies could also be fined up to €50 million ($53 million) for failing to remove inappropriate content within 24 hours after a complaint has been filed.

These colorful bulbs offer you the best features available today. Read More . And it makes sense — who doesn’t want to turn their lights on and off with their phone (or even with their voice, provided they have an Echo or Google Home Google Home Review and Giveaway Google Home Review and Giveaway Google Home is a personal assistant smart speaker, and comes from a company that literally knows everything. The $130 Google device answers questions, controls your smart home, and plays music. Should you buy one? Read More )? It’s just convenient! Today, we’re going to dig into the Xiaomi Yeelight Smart Light Strip. It’s a 2-meter (6.56-ft) strip of LEDs that connect to your home Wi-Fi to let you control them from your phone, or remotely. Obviously, the first name that comes to mind in connected lighting is the Phillips Hue, and in the case of smart strip LEDs, the Hue goes for around $90 (and needs a hub). There’s also the LIFX Z starter kit that sells for the same price. The Xiaomi Yeelight is available from GearBest for just $30! Courtesy of GearBest, we’ve got a strip to give away to one lucky reader – read on to find out how to win. Initial Impressions The first thing you’ll notice when you get your Yeelight Smart Light Strip is that nothing about it feels cheap. It comes in a very Apple-like white box that makes it feel much more expensive than it actually is. Once you crack it open, you’re greeted by the flexible lighting strip, with the power lead and remote tucked underneath. The power cable is quite long, coming in at 3 meters (9.8ft), while the strip itself measures 2 meters. The single-button remote sits on the cable. You hit the button quickly to turn the light on and off, and you hold it down to change the color. Of course, you’re buying a smart light strip, which means you’ll probably be using the Internet features to work with the light more often than not. Still, having the remote is nice for situations where your Internet is down, or you just don’t feel like pulling your phone out. The Lights Quickly, before we jump into all the internet features of the Yeelight, let’s just take a moment to look at the actual lights themselves. First, they have support for 16 million colors with RGB LEDs, so you can definitely tweak them to support whatever mood you’re trying to achieve. There’s no separate white LEDs though. The lights are also quite bright, coming in at 140 lumens. At full brightness, these will light up an area quite well. If you’re using them under cabinets to light up your counter, for example, they’ll keep everything well-accented. The strip itself is flexible, so you can safely bend it to get around corners or to cast focus on something round. It also has specific spots on the strip so you can cut it if you don’t need to full length for the DIY project 5 DIY Home Automation Projects to Get Started With Your Smart Home 5 DIY Home Automation Projects to Get Started With Your Smart Home When it comes to creating smart homes, most people just don't know where to start.

Speaking of which, it comes with an adhesive backing so you an easily stick it to just about whatever you want. Depending on the situation, you can also get more creative with how you mount it, but for most people, the adhesive backing will get the lights up and rolling. They’re also somewhat rugged, coming with an IP-65 rating thanks to the rubberised coating that covers any electrical contacts. This means they’re highly resistant to water hitting the surface of the light (but not fully submersible), and completely dust-tight. Connected Features The real key to the Xiaomi Yeelight Smart Light Strip is the fact that it connects to the internet. Once you plug the light in, you need to download the Yeelight app and follow the process. It all worked on the first try, and was easy to get up and running. The app does make you choose a server location, and the only options are Singapore and China mainland. I’m in the US, but it worked fine with the Singapore server. The app itself does what you’d expect — you can turn the lights on and off, change the color, and adjust the brightness. The basic functions you’d expect from a light are certainly all there. You can also set them to run on a schedule. You can tell them to turn off and on automatically at a specific time, or you can turn on the sleep timer to have the lights go off after a certain amount of time. Another cool function within the app is the ability to create preset scenes. They’re easy to make, and it’ll allow you to jump between multiple presets without needing to manually drag the colors around. Obviously, this feature is much more useful if you have multiple Yeelights, as you can set scenes to make them all work together in unison – but it’s also required if you want to use IFTTT IFTTT Applets Are Finally Here: What You Need to Know IFTTT Applets Are Finally Here: What You Need to Know Now, you can connect multiple apps with IFTTT applets. Find out all you need to know about them and enhance your productivity. Read More with your lights (and trust me, you do). The Favorite option in the app lets you choose from a number of recommended looks (or create your own). For example, you can choose sunrise to have the light ease into a bright yellow light over 15 minutes. You can choose sunset to go the opposite way over 10 minutes, as well. These preset scenes offer a fun way to enhance the mood in any room. Third-Party Features Right out of the box, the lights have Alexa certification, which means they have full support to work with Echo for voice control. I don’t own an Echo, but based on user reviews, it does seem to work quite well. Where I really put the Yeelight through its paces is with IFTTT support. You open up all kinds of possibilities with it. I set it up to work with Google Home through it, and it worked perfectly. I set the command to, “Hey Google, turn on/off the strip light,” and it did just that. You could also set commends to change colors. For me, I set the commend, “Hey Google, make the sun go down” to cause the light to go to sunset mode. You can get creative with setting the commands however you want. Another cool use I found for IFTTT was setting the lights to turn on when I arrived home. If you attach the lights along your stairs, and use this command, you can make sure you can see where you’re going! Here are just a few other ideas for IFTTT and the Yeelight strip: Turn blue when you get a Facebook notification Turn light to favorite team’s color when their game starts Change scene when temperature outside drops below a certain point Link smart home devices to work together Those are just a few off the top of my head, but you get the idea. You can certainly get creative, and depending where you put the lights, you can do some pretty cool stuff with them. All in all, I’m impressed by the connected features offered here. Between the built-in features and IFTTT, I really can’t think of anything the lights should handle, but don’t.

Monaghan Before the invention of the computer, most experimental psychologists thought the brain was an unknowable black box. You could analyze a subject’s behavior—ring bell, dog salivates—but thoughts, memories, emotions? That stuff was obscure and inscrutable, beyond the reach of science. So these behaviorists, as they called themselves, confined their work to the study of stimulus and response, feedback and reinforcement, bells and saliva. They gave up trying to understand the inner workings of the mind. They ruled their field for four decades. Then, in the mid-1950s, a group of rebellious psychologists, linguists, information theorists, and early artificial-intelligence researchers came up with a different conception of the mind. People, they argued, were not just collections of conditioned responses. They absorbed information, processed it, and then acted upon it. They had systems for writing, storing, and recalling memories. They operated via a logical, formal syntax. The brain wasn’t a black box at all. It was more like a computer. June 2016. Subscribe now. The so-called cognitive revolution started small, but as computers became standard equipment in psychology labs across the country, it gained broader acceptance. By the late 1970s, cognitive psychology had overthrown behaviorism, and with the new regime came a whole new language for talking about mental life. Psychologists began describing thoughts as programs, ordinary people talked about storing facts away in their memory banks, and business gurus fretted about the limits of mental bandwidth and processing power in the modern workplace. This story has repeated itself again and again. As the digital revolution wormed its way into every part of our lives, it also seeped into our language and our deep, basic theories about how things work. Technology always does this. During the Enlightenment, Newton and Descartes inspired people to think of the universe as an elaborate clock. In the industrial age, it was a machine with pistons. (Freud’s idea of psychodynamics borrowed from the thermodynamics of steam engines.) Now it’s a computer. Which is, when you think about it, a fundamentally empowering idea. Because if the world is a computer, then the world can be coded. Code is logical. Code is hackable. Code is destiny. These are the central tenets (and self-fulfilling prophecies) of life in the digital age. As software has eaten the world, to paraphrase venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, we have surrounded ourselves with machines that convert our actions, thoughts, and emotions into data—raw material for armies of code-wielding engineers to manipulate. We have come to see life itself as something ruled by a series of instructions that can be discovered, exploited, optimized, maybe even rewritten. Companies use code to understand our most intimate ties; Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has gone so far as to suggest there might be a “fundamental mathematical law underlying human relationships that governs the balance of who and what we all care about.” In 2013, Craig Venter announced that, a decade after the decoding of the human genome, he had begun to write code that would allow him to create synthetic organisms. “It is becoming clear,” he said, “that all living cells that we know of on this planet are DNA-software-driven biological machines.” Even self-help literature insists that you can hack your own source code, reprogramming your love life, your sleep routine, and your spending habits.

Watch Him Do the Same With AI. In this world, the ability to write code has become not just a desirable skill but a language that grants insider status to those who speak it. They have access to what in a more mechanical age would have been called the levers of power. “If you control the code, you control the world,” wrote futurist Marc Goodman. (In Bloomberg Businessweek, Paul Ford was slightly more circumspect: “If coders don’t run the world, they run the things that run the world.” Tomato, tomahto.) But whether you like this state of affairs or hate it—whether you’re a member of the coding elite or someone who barely feels competent to futz with the settings on your phone—don’t get used to it. Our machines are starting to speak a different language now, one that even the best coders can’t fully understand. Over the past several years, the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley have aggressively pursued an approach to computing called machine learning. In traditional programming, an engineer writes explicit, step-by-step instructions for the computer to follow. With machine learning, programmers don’t encode computers with instructions. They train them. If you want to teach a neural network to recognize a cat, for instance, you don’t tell it to look for whiskers, ears, fur, and eyes. You simply show it thousands and thousands of photos of cats, and eventually it works things out. If it keeps misclassifying foxes as cats, you don’t rewrite the code. You just keep coaching it. This approach is not new—it’s been around for decades—but it has recently become immensely more powerful, thanks in part to the rise of deep neural networks, massively distributed computational systems that mimic the multilayered connections of neurons in the brain. And already, whether you realize it or not, machine learning powers large swaths of our online activity. Facebook uses it to determine which stories show up in your News Feed, and Google Photos uses it to identify faces. Machine learning runs Microsoft’s Skype Translator, which converts speech to different languages in real time. Self-driving cars use machine learning to avoid accidents. Even Google’s search engine—for so many years a towering edifice of human-written rules—has begun to rely on these deep neural networks. In February the company replaced its longtime head of search with machine-learning expert John Giannandrea, and it has initiated a major program to retrain its engineers in these new techniques. “By building learning systems,” Giannandrea told reporters this fall, “we don’t have to write these rules anymore.” Our machines speak a different language now, one that even the best coders can’t fully understand. But here’s the thing: With machine learning, the engineer never knows precisely how the computer accomplishes its tasks. The neural network’s operations are largely opaque and inscrutable. It is, in other words, a black box. And as these black boxes assume responsibility for more and more of our daily digital tasks, they are not only going to change our relationship to technology—they are going to change how we think about ourselves, our world, and our place within it. If in the old view programmers were like gods, authoring the laws that govern computer systems, now they’re like parents or dog trainers. And as any parent or dog owner can tell you, that is a much more mysterious relationship to find yourself in. Andy Rubin is an inveterate tinkerer and coder. The cocreator of the Android operating system, Rubin is notorious in Silicon Valley for filling his workplaces and home with robots. He programs them himself. “I got into computer science when I was very young, and I loved it because I could disappear in the world of the computer. It was a clean slate, a blank canvas, and I could create something from scratch,” he says. “It gave me full control of a world that I played in for many, many years.” Now, he says, that world is coming to an end. Rubin is excited about the rise of machine learning—his new company, Playground Global, invests in machine-learning startups and is positioning itself to lead the spread of intelligent devices—but it saddens him a little too. Because machine learning changes what it means to be an engineer. “People don’t linearly write the programs,” Rubin says. “After a neural network learns how to do speech recognition, a programmer can’t go in and look at it and see how that happened. It’s just like your brain. You can’t cut your head off and see what you’re thinking.” When engineers do peer into a deep neural network, what they see is an ocean of math: a massive, multilayer set of calculus problems that—by constantly deriving the relationship between billions of data points—generate guesses about the world. Artificial intelligence wasn’t supposed to work this way. Until a few years ago, mainstream AI researchers assumed that to create intelligence, we just had to imbue a machine with the right logic. Write enough rules and eventually we’d create a system sophisticated enough to understand the world. They largely ignored, even vilified, early proponents of machine learning, who argued in favor of plying machines with data until they reached their own conclusions. For years computers weren’t powerful enough to really prove the merits of either approach, so the argument became a philosophical one. “Most of these debates were based on fixed beliefs about how the world had to be organized and how the brain worked,” says Sebastian Thrun, the former Stanford AI professor who created Google’s self-driving car. “Neural nets had no symbols or rules, just numbers. That alienated a lot of people.” The implications of an unparsable machine language aren’t just philosophical. For the past two decades, learning to code has been one of the surest routes to reliable employment—a fact not lost on all those parents enrolling their kids in after-school code academies. But a world run by neurally networked deep-learning machines requires a different workforce. Analysts have already started worrying about the impact of AI on the job market, as machines render old skills irrelevant. Programmers might soon get a taste of what that feels like themselves. Just as Newtonian physics wasn’t obviated by quantum mechanics, code will remain a powerful tool set to explore the world. “I was just having a conversation about that this morning,” says tech guru Tim O’Reilly when I ask him about this shift. “I was pointing out how different programming jobs would be by the time all these STEM-educated kids grow up.” Traditional coding won’t disappear completely—indeed, O’Reilly predicts that we’ll still need coders for a long time yet—but there will likely be less of it, and it will become a meta skill, a way of creating what Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, calls the “scaffolding” within which machine learning can operate. Just as Newtonian physics wasn’t obviated by the discovery of quantum mechanics, code will remain a powerful, if incomplete, tool set to explore the world. But when it comes to powering specific functions, machine learning will do the bulk of the work for us. Of course, humans still have to train these systems. But for now, at least, that’s a rarefied skill. The job requires both a high-level grasp of mathematics and an intuition for pedagogical give-and-take. “It’s almost like an art form to get the best out of these systems,” says Demis Hassabis, who leads Google’s DeepMind AI team. “There’s only a few hundred people in the world that can do that really well.” But even that tiny number has been enough to transform the tech industry in just a couple of years. Whatever the professional implications of this shift, the cultural consequences will be even bigger. If the rise of human-written software led to the cult of the engineer, and to the notion that human experience can ultimately be reduced to a series of comprehensible instructions, machine learning kicks the pendulum in the opposite direction. The code that runs the universe may defy human analysis. Right now Google, for example, is facing an antitrust investigation in Europe that accuses the company of exerting undue influence over its search results. Such a charge will be difficult to prove when even the company’s own engineers can’t say exactly how its search algorithms work in the first place. This explosion of indeterminacy has been a long time coming. It’s not news that even simple algorithms can create unpredictable emergent behavior—an insight that goes back to chaos theory and random number generators. Over the past few years, as networks have grown more intertwined and their functions more complex, code has come to seem more like an alien force, the ghosts in the machine ever more elusive and ungovernable. Planes grounded for no reason. Seemingly unpreventable flash crashes in the stock market. Rolling blackouts. These forces have led technologist Danny Hillis to declare the end of the age of Enlightenment, our centuries-long faith in logic, determinism, and control over nature. Hillis says we’re shifting to what he calls the age of Entanglement. “As our technological and institutional creations have become more complex, our relationship to them has changed,” he wrote in the Journal of Design and Science. “Instead of being masters of our creations, we have learned to bargain with them, cajoling and guiding them in the general direction of our goals. We have built our own jungle, and it has a life of its own.” The rise of machine learning is the latest—and perhaps the last—step in this journey. This can all be pretty frightening. After all, coding was at least the kind of thing that a regular person could imagine picking up at a boot camp. Coders were at least human. Now the technological elite is even smaller, and their command over their creations has waned and become indirect. Already the companies that build this stuff find it behaving in ways that are hard to govern. Last summer, Google rushed to apologize when its photo recognition engine started tagging images of black people as gorillas. The company’s blunt first fix was to keep the system from labeling anything as a gorilla. To nerds of a certain bent, this all suggests a coming era in which we forfeit authority over our machines. “One can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand,” wrote Stephen Hawking—sentiments echoed by Elon Musk and Bill Gates, among others. “Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.” But don’t be too scared; this isn’t the dawn of Skynet. We’re just learning the rules of engagement with a new technology. Already, engineers are working out ways to visualize what’s going on under the hood of a deep-learning system. But even if we never fully understand how these new machines think, that doesn’t mean we’ll be powerless before them. In the future, we won’t concern ourselves as much with the underlying sources of their behavior; we’ll learn to focus on the behavior itself. The code will become less important than the data we use to train it. This isn’t the dawn of Skynet. We’re just learning the rules of engagement with a new technology. If all this seems a little familiar, that’s because it looks a lot like good old 20th-century behaviorism. In fact, the process of training a machine-learning algorithm is often compared to the great behaviorist experiments of the early 1900s. Pavlov triggered his dog’s salivation not through a deep understanding of hunger but simply by repeating a sequence of events over and over. He provided data, again and again, until the code rewrote itself. And say what you will about the behaviorists, they did know how to control their subjects. In the long run, Thrun says, machine learning will have a democratizing influence. In the same way that you don’t need to know HTML to build a website these days, you eventually won’t need a PhD to tap into the insane power of deep learning. Programming won’t be the sole domain of trained coders who have learned a series of arcane languages. It’ll be accessible to anyone who has ever taught a dog to roll over. “For me, it’s the coolest thing ever in programming,” Thrun says, “because now anyone can program.” For much of computing history, we have taken an inside-out view of how machines work. First we write the code, then the machine expresses it. This worldview implied plasticity, but it also suggested a kind of rules-based determinism, a sense that things are the product of their underlying instructions. Machine learning suggests the opposite, an outside-in view in which code doesn’t just determine behavior, behavior also determines code. Machines are products of the world. Ultimately we will come to appreciate both the power of handwritten linear code and the power of machine-learning algorithms to adjust it—the give-and-take of design and emergence. It’s possible that biologists have already started figuring this out. Gene-editing techniques like Crispr give them the kind of code-manipulating power that traditional software programmers have wielded. But discoveries in the field of epigenetics suggest that genetic material is not in fact an immutable set of instructions but rather a dynamic set of switches that adjusts depending on the environment and experiences of its host. Our code does not exist separate from the physical world; it is deeply influenced and transmogrified by it. Venter may believe cells are DNA-software-driven machines, but epigeneticist Steve Cole suggests a different formulation: “A cell is a machine for turning experience into biology.” And now, 80 years after Alan Turing first sketched his designs for a problem-solving machine, computers are becoming devices for turning experience into technology. For decades we have sought the secret code that could explain and, with some adjustments, optimize our experience of the world. But our machines won’t work that way for much longer—and our world never really did. We’re about to have a more complicated but ultimately more rewarding relationship with technology. We will go from commanding our devices to parenting them. Editor at large Jason Tanz (@jasontanz) wrote about Andy Rubin’s new company, Playground, in issue 24.03.

Kumar Avinash Bhat March 18, 2017 17:40 IST Updated: March 20, 2017 01:05 IST more-in From the Field Website hits (visits) jumped to half a million last December, when fake stories around demonetisation started to circulate. In January, a report by a news agency claiming that the United Arab Emirates had attached assets of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim went viral after it was picked up by members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and shared on social media. Subsequently, the Ambassador of the UAE in India dismissed the reports saying that he did not know of any such raids. The immediacy of social media and instant messaging platforms such as WhatsApp make it tempting to share information to a wider audience with a simple swipe on a smart phone. In this age of post-truth and alternative facts, users are susceptible to nuggets of information that tap into a wide range of emotions from outrage to pride, anger to patriotism. The necessary service of fact-checking or verification of social media posts is yet to pick up in India, but it is becoming vital in a country that crossed 346.22 million mobile internet users in September last year (a report by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India). Internationally, Snopes.com has a section dealing with India-based forwards and posts, but the reach of Snopes is limited in a country that loves its forwards and accepts their claims with touching trust. There are a handful of fact-checking websites in the country, but they are more focused on verifying political news and government data. This leaves a wide gap for the other kinds of forwards that people receive and share on a minute to minute basis. The boy/ girl missing, blood needed, the ten rupee coin banned kind of forwards tend to spread like wildfire. Most people do not have the time and resources or even see the need to verify these messages before sharing them. Finally, a handful of websites are beginning to find ways to bust these forwards. In 2015, Shammas Oliyath was one among thousands of people who received a forward about a child admitted to KIMS Hospital in Bengaluru needing assistance. It led to chaos even in the hospital, with authorities wondering which ward the child was in. “It was revealed much later that the child was in Mumbai,” says Oliyath. This bothered the software engineer enough to talk to friend Bala Krishn Birla and eventually start a Wordpress blog listing out such spam messages. Then, last August, the duo launched Check4Spam.com, a myth-busting website. “We got our own domain and started a Whatsapp number to collect spam messages from people, so that we could research them and label them as true or false,” says Birla, an engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur. The two friends analyse social media messages and forwards besides holding full-time day jobs. Tricky research Finding out if a forwarded message is factually correct is not an easy task. Many people simply delete outlandish messages. However, for many, a cry for help or a carefully worded message that endorses (or counters) their ideological views is hard to ignore. Fake messages can range from the seemingly innocent, like a change in Indian Railway’s ticket booking system, to the bizarre like leftover onions being poisonous. “Then, there are the UNESCO forwards. According to these, the UNESCO selects everything Indian to be the best in the world,” said Shreyas K, an advertising professional who works in Bengaluru. “Most spam messages can be verified based on online research. I usually spend three hours once I reach home after work researching the submissions we receive from site visitors. However, for the smartly created ones, it takes much longer and involves calling the numbers listed in the message as well,” Oliyath explained. This is not as simple as it may seem. Sometimes two or more photos sourced from unrelated places are morphed to create a single image. “A simple reverse image search on Google does not work in such cases,” said Oliyath. Then, the duo has to separate each image and submit it for a reverse search individually. “Now imagine if it is a collage,” he said, smiling. According to Birla, spam can be broadly categorised into text, text plus image, and image files. They can be classified as ideological, finance-based and no-good-for-anything type messages. The last would include something inane like a woman giving birth to 11 babies. “In this case,” said Birla, “we found that the woman was a South American and the 11 infants were from an IVF clinic in Gujarat!” Rapid grapevine A big problem that verifiers face is the incredible speed with which a spam message is spread. “A forward that has been shared thousands of times will be all over Google. Often, the first results when we start verifying will be of websites containing the same news. Most of the time, these websites are just looking to attract visitors and don’t bother to verify the content individually,” said T. Arvind, a search engine optimisation, or SEO, expert. This becomes a time-consuming barrier for those looking to trace the source. “We often find answers only after the first five-ten pages of Google search. With morphed images, the real images tend to get pushed down in the search results and will appear only after ten pages,” explained Oliyath. Some fake news forwards go viral so quickly that damage control is the only option. A case in point was a Valentine’s Day notice purportedly issued by the management of a popular Bengaluru college, which stated that it was mandatory for female students to have at least one boyfriend by February 14. As the fake notice went viral, the college was prompted to issue a statement that the information was false. Globally, both Google and Facebook have announced several measures to weed out users and websites that carry fake news. Last month, Google announced a tie-up with French news agencies to verify news, photos and even memes about the French Presidential elections. These efforts are yet to reach India. 150 a day and growing As probably the first website dedicated to checking spam and fake forwards in the country, Oliyath and Birla are on a tough journey. “I am usually up till 1 a.m. doing research. When we get verification requests for spam we have already dealt with, I spend 30-45 minutes during my lunch break to respond with the relevant links. We get around 150 requests in a day and most of these forwards have already been dealt with on our website,” said Oliyath. Oliyath handles the research and Birla handles the technology. “I spend two-three hours a day on the site. We struggle when traffic increases. Some days when there is a strong rumour doing the rounds, we have more than 1,000 users on the site. A case in point is when there was a message about electronic registration of property,” said Birla. To help maintain the website, the duo has opted for Google’s advertising platform. “This helps us break even on the cost of maintaining the website. While we are not looking to make a profit from the site, we certainly do want to grow. A browser plugin or making the API available to other developers are some of the things we are looking at,” he said. With 80% of all requests received by Check4Spam falling firmly in the rumour/ spam category, the work can get a little overwhelming at times. “We are now looking for volunteers to help with the fact-checking. Many people do fact-check for their own satisfaction or for telling their friends. If they send us their research debunking a myth, we will scrutinise the method and if satisfied, post it on our website” said Oliyath. Scaling up The website has received close to 2,250 requests for verification since October last year. An average of 120 requests a day is the norm, with the site seeing around a quarter million hits per month on average. Hits went up to half a million in December 2016, when several rumours based on demonetisation started circulating. They are looking at adding a ‘partly true’ section, which is also found in some international fact-checking websites. Eventually, Check4Spam wants to scale up by collaborating with other like-minded teams from across the country. While reaching the level of a Snopes.com will take a few years, the founders say they have the patience to play the long game. “There are teams in Hyderabad and other cities. I plan to reach out to them so that we could all work together and avoid duplication.” For now, the website is committed to staying non-commercial. “We won’t consider funding unless the source matches our commitment to weeding out fake news,” said Oliyath. Corrections & Clarifications: Editing error - The strapline of the report said, “verification request jumped to half a million last December, when fake stories around demonetisation started to circulate.” It is actually, Website hits jumped to half a million… Post a Comment More In Internet human interest science and technology internet Related Articles << Previous Story Kremlin, on U.S. Yahoo hack charges, says its spies not involved Next Story >> Please Wait while comments are loading...

Google Drive Websites Host For Free Rochester Business Journal March 15, 2017 We all know google drive offer free web hosting,  However, Google has now decided to pull the plug on the tool due to increased competition. The company revealed that users have better options available to them now, given the fact that several web content hosting tools and services already exist compared to the time Google launched the tool. Because of this, Google is now looking to discontinue offering the said tool and will instead channel its energy on the core Drive and Google apps experience. While it can be argued that Google could have made the web hosting tool a paid service and incorporated additional features to make it commercially viable and appealing, it seems the company is happier taking the exit route, here is a quick and easy to read google web hosting reviews . However, with a year to go before the Google Drive web hosting tool becomes defunct, one can still deploy it to host sites that require only basic HTML. The tool also has API support for developers. Those who are currently making use of Drive's free web hosting service can look at shifting to other services . Alternatively, Google Domains will also be able to refer users of Drive to third-party sites that offer website hosting services. What You're Saying  There are no comments yet.

But, we’re inside the window where it’s time for Android O rumors to take off and that yearly tradition is starting off with a few interesting features. We’ve already seen a teaser about the potential Oreo name, but to be fair on that Hiroshi Lockheimer is not the most reliable source.  Unfortunately, we can’t be too sure about the source of these rumors either. The unnamed source for 9to5Google appears to have insider knowledge and the outlet has gotten scoops before, so we’ll have to see. The details of the rumors are also a bit lacking. Supposedly, there are a number of new features planned, including: Changes to notifications App icon badges for notifications Picture-in-picture mode Smart text selection toolbar with Assistant integration Restricted background app activity Adaptive icons MediaRecorder API improvements A “ton” of features focused on enterprise Some of these are pretty easy to guess what they mean: app icon badges are something we’ve seen on iOS since the beginning, although they are quite divisive (I, like other inbox-zero types, hate them). Picture-in-picture mode sounds like a floating window and is a feature already available on Android TV. Restricted background app activity is also self-explanatory and likely related to battery life optimization. The smart text selection sounds like a more targeted version of the already available Screen Search feature of Assistant. And, adaptive icons could well mean dynamic icons so weather apps or calendar apps can be more relevant at a glance.  However, the other features are quite vague, so we’re not going to speculate too much. Instead, we’ll leave it to you guys. What would you like to see in terms of an update to the notification system in Android?

 French advertising group stops all ad spend on Google and YouTube Rebecca Stewart, The Drum Mar. 17, 2017, 12:37 PM 2,034 facebook linkedin twitter email print Paul Frampton, Havas chief executive and country manager. Havas Havas Group UK is pausing all YouTube and Google Display Network ad spend until further notice, with chief executive and country manager Paul Frampton saying it has a "duty of care" to clients to ensure brand safety. The advertising giant said it had taken the decision on behalf of its UK clients which include O2, Royal Mail, the BBC and Domino's. It will not pull investment from Google Search ads which are verified. The decision comes weeks after an initial Times investigation, which claimed household names were inadvertently funding extremism by serving ads next to content from terrorists and neo-nazi groups. It has provoked debate in the industry and earlier today the Guardian took the dramatic step of canceling all ads on Google and YouTube in protest following further revelations from the Times. Havas said its move was a direct result of the latest revelations and that Google has been unable to provide specific reassurances and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters. When approached by The Drum Google had no comment on the matter. "We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace to position their brands in the right context where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands' objectives," said Frampton. Havas' has said its halt on investment will remain until it is confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards it and its clients expect. "Our teams are working with the brands we represent to select alternative partners where we are confident of the third party verification and safety guarantees," said Frampton. His official statement echoes comments he made earlier on Twitter: It's our duty of care to our @Havas_MGUK clients to ensure their brands are not at all compromised in inappropriate inventory. https://t.co/VtVkjJwy8p — Paul Frampton Calero (@Paul_Framp) March 17, 2017 Get the latest Google stock price here.

Who am I kidding? It’s not, but compression technology is very practical. Take Google’s new open source JPEG algorithm called Guetzli — it can dramatically reduce the size of JPEG images without loss of quality, according to ArsTechnica. As per Google’s Research Blog and GitHub, Guetzli-generated JPEG files are up to 35 percent smaller than most current JPEGs encoded with the widely-used libjpeg encoder. With smaller JPEG files, you’ll not only be able to store more pictures (and most importantly: selfies) on your phone and computer, but websites that use Guetzli-encoded JPEGs would also (at least, in theory) load faster. If all of this sounds familiar — relax, you’re not losing your mind. In 2010, Google developed WebP, a new image format that could display pictures that are up to 34 percent smaller than JPEGs. Unfortunately, WebP didn’t gain much traction because it was (and still is) only supported by Chrome and Opera. Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer never bothered to support WebP, leaving it to essentially die. Guetzli-generated photo files have no such incompatibility issues. It’ll display in all browsers because they’re just regular JPEG files. How exactly does Guetzli create smaller JPEGs? Google Research’s explanation is highly technical: In plain English, as ArsTechnica writes, Guetzli, like all JPEG encoders, tries to “reduce a large amount of disordered data, which is hard to compress, into ordered data, which is very easy to compress.” Smaller files are achieved by blurring together pixels that are similar, but only just enough to not distort the overall image’s structure. Google says it asked people whether they preferred libjpeg-encoded JPEGs or Guetzli JPEGs and most picked the latter. – Source: Mashable Ghana News Google Technology Marian Efe Ansah Tagged with: Ghana News Google Technology More on citifmonline.com Google apologises after ads appear next to extremist content March 21, 2017 YouTube responds to criticism of LGBTQ video ‘blocking’ March 20, 2017 Uber president Jeff Jones steps down March 20, 2017 US man held for sending flashing tweet to epileptic writer March 19, 2017 Teenagers build their own mental health app March 18, 2017 TECNO launches slimmest Power King smartphone March 18, 2017 General News Kintampo waterfalls closed down indefinitely March 21, 2017 Four basic schools in Walewale temporarily shut down   March 21, 2017 Newspaper Headlines: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 March 21, 2017 Marwako assault victim’s health status improves – Lawyer March 21, 2017 I have big plans for Ghana – Nana Addo March 21, 2017 Advertisement Recent Posts Kintampo waterfalls closed down indefinitely Beijing installs facial recognition in toilets to combat tissue theft Four basic schools in Walewale temporarily shut down   Newspaper Headlines: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 Google apologises after ads appear next to extremist content Marwako assault victim’s health status improves – Lawyer I have big plans for Ghana – Nana Addo German spy agency chief doubtful Gulen was behind Turkey coup attempt Koforidua SECTECH student dies after night out Top class hospitals attend Dubai-Africa health Roadshow in Accra Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2017 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

Nexus 6 has been the only smartphone launched by Google that gets its OS update later than the other Nexus devices. Also, when these updates finally arrive, they break various features that were working or add bugs that need to be fixed in future releases. Now it appears that Google has decided to remove the problems altogether and get all Nexus 6 stuck on Android 7.0 Nougat. However, Google has already released Android 7.1.1 Nougat for the Nexus 6, but the update has brought several bugs. The newly discovered bugs were then addressed in the most recent March security update, which, in turn, broke Android Pay support. According to AndroidPolice, many Nexus 6 users report they have captured a new OS update that rolls back their software version to Android 7.0 Nougat, even though they had Android 7.1.1 installed. A fresh thread that now gathered many comments is up on reddit, as Nexus 6 owners continue to receive Android 7.0 Nougat updates on their phones. Google has not made any comments on the matter and there are speculations that the search giant will start communicating with customers sooner or later. Also, the fact that some Nexus 6 owners are now getting rolled back to Android 7.0 Nougat could be a mistake. A server gone haywire or another bug that force-pushes these updates although it shouldn't. What's worse is that, after the update, many apps will start crashing, so the only option Nexus 6 owners have is to completely wipe their devices and reinstall everything. Which means, either this is a blunder, or a move towards making the Nexus run smoothly again.

In fact, such compression is used by many to keep the size of images on websites down in order to increase performance. But compression to this point has always resulted in either at best mostly retaining visual quality or degrading it in some way, even if it is only a very small amount. Google has changed the game however, with a new open source algorithm that will not only reduce a file's size, but also increase the perceived quality. The algorithm is called Guetzli, and it can reduce a JPEG's file size by as much as 35% while increasing the visual quality or, alternatively, image quality can be significantly improved while keeping file sizes the same.  Guetzli [guɛtsli] — which means "cookie" in Swiss German — is a JPEG encoder for digital images and web graphics that can enable faster online experiences by producing smaller JPEG files while still maintaining compatibility with existing browsers, image processing applications and the JPEG standard. This is very similar to Google's Zopfli algorithm, which produces smaller PNG and gzip files without needing to introduce a new format. It is different, however, than the techniques used in RNN-based image compression, RAISR, and WebP, which Google explains, "all need client and ecosystem changes for compression gains at internet scale."   This 16x16 is a pixel synthetic example of a phone line hanging against a blue sky — traditionally a case where JPEG compression algorithms suffer from artifacts. Uncompressed original is on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artifacts than libjpeg (middle) and has a smaller file size. Google says that the visual quality of JPEG images is directly correlated to its multi-stage compression process: color space transform, discrete cosine transform, and quantization. The Guetzli algorithm specifically targets the quantization stage in which the more visual quality loss is introduced, the smaller the resulting file. Google says that, "Guetzli strikes a balance between minimal loss and file size by employing a search algorithm that tries to overcome the difference between the psychovisual modeling of JPEG's format, and Guetzli’s psychovisual model, which approximates color perception and visual masking in a more thorough and detailed way than what is achievable by simpler color transforms and the discrete cosine transform." The tradeoff, however, is that while Guetzli creates smaller image files, these search algorithms take much longer to create a compressed image than any other method that is currently available.   This is a 20x24 pixel zoomed areas from a picture of a cat’s eye. Uncompressed original on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artifacts than libjpeg (middle) without requiring a larger file size. That said, in experimentation with the algorithm, the researchers discovered that even when files were kept at the same size, people were rating Guetzli-created images more favorably than the original. The researchers think that since the images look better to the human eye, the time it takes to generate the image is worth the tradeoff.  The Guetzli team hopes that their algorithm will help webmasters and graphic designers make users' experiences smoother on image-heavy websites, in addition to reducing load times and bandwidth costs for mobile users. They also hope that their success here, and perhaps widespread use of the algorithm, will inspire others to further delve into the image- and video- compression research space. The algorithm is on Github now, and is free to download.

By Agamoni Ghosh March 18, 2017 10:11 GMT Will the next Android OS be named after Oreo cookiesGetty Images Google is expected to preview the next version of Android OS, the Android O, most likely at the Google I/O in May. While most Android devices are still waiting for their Nougat update, rumours have started to float about the Android O. 9 to 5 Google has received some tips on how the next Android OS will shape up with an array of new features many of which will include active participation from the Google Assistant. Below are some of the early rumours on the Android O: Notification badges for active apps: Like the iOS app icons, Android O may also start giving badges for active app's notifications. This will enable the user to take a quick look at all the notifications by looking at the home screen. Notification UI change: There is no clarity on what change will be brought to the notification UI, but the report states it will be different from previous Android versions. Picture-in-picture mode: Like the Android TV, the Android O is expected to add a picture-in-picture mode, something iPads have had for quite a while. Smart text selection: This feature is expected to automatically copy relevant information from apps and show it when it is needed. Text selection can be a pain on mobiles, especially those with smaller screen sizes. The text selection will be integrated with the Google Assistant to understand what text to select. Adaptive icons: Inspired from its own smartphone Pixel's UI, the feature may allow dynamic changing of icons, which the Pixel Launcher currently does. Gesture controls: VentureBeat has suggested that the next version of Android OS may incorporate some finger gestures similar to knuckle gestures seen in Honor phones. The Android O or Android 8.0 will likely be released towards the end of the year but the name of the OS is still a mystery. Most people are vouching for Android Oreo as Google has always named its Android OS after a popular sweet treat.

Share this 0 Share this 0 Last updated: 18 March 2017, 09:30 GMT Print this story Google has been asked to explain itself after Government adverts were placed on “inappropriate and hate-filled sites”. The technology giant has been accused of “profiting from hatred” by MPs over its YouTube advertising system that saw taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist content on the video site. The Home Affairs Select Committee has now written to Google asking for an explanation. YouTube also said they do no proactive work to tackle illegal posts – not even on terrorism or online child abuse. Was shocked by that. — Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) March 14, 2017 The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”, while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. Google’s Peter Barron was grilled by the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week (PA) In a letter to Google’s communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. “As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. “In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers.” Labour’s Yvette Cooper chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee (PA) The internet giant’s UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat what it called “bad advertising”. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. “With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right. (Dominic Lipinski/PA) “In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies,” he said. “We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.” However, Ms Cooper said the company’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” towards the content was “extremely troubling”. Ms Cooper criticised Google’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” (PA) “It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content,” she said. “The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube’s very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred.” Share this 0 Share this 0 Last updated: 18 March 2017, 09:30 GMT Advertisement Odd news  Dame Vera Lynn's image projected on white cliffs of Dover to mark 100th birthday There won't be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover on the day the singer of the famous 1942 version of the tune turns 100, but the landmark will receive a makeover of a different kind.   Latest news videos Advertisement Most Popular Most read Most shared 1 How to fix your Windows 10 Start menu 2 Does eating late at night make you fat? 3 Windows 10 problems?

These tips are geared towards non-power users and those that are thinking about installing the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the first time. In November, Google pushed out its initial Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system. The update brought new features to Nexus 5, Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10 users and it helped usher in the company’s release of the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. Android 5.0 Lollipop also brought a number of Nexus Lollipop problems to users, problems that Google’s been trying to solve in the months after its first release. Several weeks after the initial Android 5.0 Lollipop release, Google rolled out two Lollipop bug fix updates aimed at tackling problems plaguing Nexus smartphone and tablet users. The first was Android 5.0.1 Lollipop, the other, Android 5.0.2 Lollipop. Both of these updates tackled some of more glaring Lollipop issues. Since then, Google’s been rolling out Android 5.1 Lollipop to Nexus smartphones and tablets. In April alone we’ve seen Android 5.1, a giant bug fix update, land for key Nexus devices including the Nexus 7 2013. Android 5.1 brings bug fixes and some feature tweaks to Nexus users but it also brings some Lollipop problems of its own. We’ve detailed Nexus Android 5.1 problems and it’s clear that more than a few Nexus users are suffering from random reboots, battery drain, poor connectivity, and more. And that’s why it wasn’t too surprising to see an Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update emerge at the beginning of the month. On April 1st, Google mentioned Android 5.1.1 for the first time in an update to its Android SDK. Several days ago, the Android 5.1.1 update appeared on Google’s website, a sign that a release for select Nexus devices is imminent. Today, the company released a Nexus Player Android 5.1.1 update factory image, a sign that the Android 5.1.1 OTA is about to begin. With a Nexus Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update almost here for some users, right now is the perfect time to make your final preparations for the release. Here, we want to tell you about some things you should do ahead of Google’s next big Android 5.0 Lollipop update. These pre-release tips will help Nexus users and they will come in handy should Google decide to roll out more Android 5.0-based updates in the future. Look Into Android 5.1 & Lollipop If you currently own a Nexus smartphone or tablet and you’ve somehow managed to avoid the Android 5.0 Lollipop update, now is a great time to get familiar with the update’s features. Android 5.0 Lollipop is a whole lot different than Android 4.4 KitKat and you don’t want to get blindsided if you ultimately decide to move to Android 5.1.1. We’ve reviewed the Android 5.0 Lollipop update numerous times already and that feedback will help you get started. We also recommend taking a look at the slideshow below. This slideshow compares the KitKat update to the Lollipop update and it will get you ready for the changes you will encounter if you’re moving straight from Android 4.4 KitKat to Android 5.1 Lollipop. Android 5.0 vs Android 4.4 Walkthrough: What’s New in Lollipop Android 5.0 vs Android 4.4 - Lockscreen   1 / 13  With Android 5.0 Lollipop Google has slightly improved the lockscreen. There's now a shortcut to the dialer by swiping left to right, and notifications are more useful and interactive. Shown right on the lockscreen they can be swiped away, slide down to expand, or double tap to instantly unlock right into that app or notification. Everything is simple and smooth, and we still have full-screen album artwork on the lockscreen while playing music. The quick shortcuts and improved notifications will come in handy for all users.   1 / 13 If you’re already on Android 5.0 but you haven’t moved to Android 5.1, then you’ll want to get familiar with Android 5.1 and its changes. Android 5.1 brings some tweaks, tweaks that will be present on Android 5.1.1. The slideshow below will get you caught up before the start of Google’s Android 5.1.1 Lollipop OTA process. Android 5.1 vs Android 5.0 Lollipop Walkthrough: What’s New Quick Settings   1 / 9 Our favorite new change has to do with Quick Settings. For those that don't even know, pulling down the notification bar twice (or once with two fingers) brings up a Quick Settings menu. From here you have access to screen brightness, and toggles for WiFi, Bluetooth, a flashlight, airplane mode, auto rotate settings, location, screen casting, and more quick toggles appear as you use them. Like hotspot control, and more. In all of our slides Android 5.1 is on the left, with the older Android 5.0 screenshot on the right. With Android 5.1 Lollipop Google made quick settings even better. Once you swipe down twice or once with two fingers, you'll have easier access to controlling WiFi or Bluetooth and connections. Rather than fumble through settings, simply tap the little drop down arrow, and you can connect to WiFi or Bluetooth devices all from here. This is a small but very convenient change, and one of our favorites.   1 / 9 Look Into Android 5.1.1 Update & Features Google hasn’t rolled out the red carpet yet for the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop release and it may not. The company often keeps its changelogs extremely vague. Android 5.1.1 isn’t expected to be a massive update but you’ll still want to dig around for information regarding its contents. The Android 5.1.1 change log can be found here. This is important if you’re already having a good experience on Android 5.1 or below. Android 5.1.1 comes with some key bug fixes but there’s always a chance that it could damage performance on your device. So you’ll want to research what it has on board and decide if it’s absolutely necessary to install on your phone or tablet. Research Lollipop Problems & Fixes Right now, ahead of your Android 5.1 roll out, is a perfect time to deep dive into the Android 5.0 problems currently affecting Nexus users. Lollipop delivered a number of problems to Nexus smartphones and tablets. And while Android 5.0.1, Android 5.0.2 and Android 5.1 fixed some of these problems, they failed to fix them all. If you take a look at the current climate, you’re going to get acclimated to the common problems affecting Nexus users on Android 5.0, Android 5.0.1, Android 5.0.2, and Android 5.1. This will help you handle Android 5.1.1 problems if they do happen to surface on your device after making the move. Android 5.1.1 should bring fixes but it could also bring problems. Android updates always do. We’ve outlined some potential fixes for a few of the more common Android 5.0 Lollipop problems but you’ll want to familiarize with as many issues and fixes as you can before installing Android 5.1.1. Our fixes are a great starting point but you’ll definitely want to poke around for other potential solutions. Get Familiar with Sideloading Google’s Android 5.0 Lollipop OTA releases have been extremely slow and unpredictable. If you’re the impatient type, we recommend taking a look at the manual update process (also known as sideloading) ahead of the Nexus Android 5.1.1 Lollipop release. Once the Android 5.1.1 OTAs start, someone will find the proper files lurking on Google’s severs. And once that happens, you’ll be able to install the Android 5.1.1 update ahead of Google’s slow moving Over-the-Air roll out. Sideloading Nexus software can be a tricky process and it can foul up the performance on your device. We do not recommend installing manually if you’re unfamiliar with the process. So while you have some time ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release,  you can try to get caught up on the process if you’re at all interested in skipping the OTA process. This guide on how to install the Nexus 4 Android 5.1 Lollipop update should get you up to speed though there are plenty of other resources out there that will help you learn about sideloading ahead of the OTA. If you’re not comfortable after doing your research, you should wait for the OTA from Google to arrive. Clean Up Your Nexus Right now, ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release, is a great time to perform some clean up your Nexus smartphone or tablet. This is going to be especially important to those of you jumping to Android 5.0 for the first time. The Lollipop update requires a ton of storage to install and that’s going to pose problems for those of you that have collected a ton of apps and files over the years. Nexus devices don’t have microSD card slots so it’s very easy to use up your internal storage space. You’ve likely downloaded applications or music or other files that you simply don’t use any more. Now is a great time to get rid of those applications and files that you no longer need to house on your internal storage. It will get rid of any clutter and also free up some valuable storage space on your tablet ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release date for your device. Back Up Your Files Thanks to the cloud and Google’s auto backup features, most of your important files are probably secure. That said, you’re going to want to ensure that you’ve backed up all of your important photos, videos, app data, and more before installing Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. There’s always a chance, albeit a small one, that something could get ruined during the transition from whatever you’re on to Android 5.1.1. The first thing you’ll want to do is ensure that Auto Backup is turned on for your important files. To do this, head over to Google’s website. It offers in-depth Auto Backup tutorials that will ensure that your precious files will be stored safely ahead of Android 5.0’s release.We also have some tips that will help you backup your files properly. It would also be smart to check on your cloud-based services (if you use them) to ensure that your files are still backed up. Again, this might seem tedious but you simply never know how the installation process is going to work out. Charge Your Device You’re going to want to ensure that your device is fully charged or at least charged enough where it’s not going to power down on you during the Android 5.1.1 installation process. The safest route to take is to ensure that your device is at least 50% charged before installing a new update. The download and installation process probably won’t ruin your battery life but you still don’t want to run the risk of having your device die during the installation process. Charge up your Nexus smartphone or tablet before downloading and installing your new software. It won’t hurt. Update Your Apps There is always a chance that a third-party app or a stock app will start misbehaving after a major Android update. There isn’t much you can do to prevent this though we’ve have some success updating our apps prior to updating to the new software. Android developers do their best to alleviate these problems as quickly as humanly possible and the best way you can help your own cause is by installing the latest bug fixes. Most apps should work after you get Android 5.1.1 on board but if you’re seeing issues after updating, you should get in contact with the developer, even if it’s Google. Check in With IT If you’re using your Nexus smartphone or tablet for work and you happen to have an IT department, you should go and chat with them before installing your Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update. Nexus users that use their device for work often run into issues with enterprise software, Wi-Fi connections, Exchange, and other important work-related features after installing Android updates. It literally happens every year after every Nexus Android release. Android 5.1.1 patched some things up but you can never be too sure. There’s is a chance that your IT department might have a recommendation ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release. Often times, that advice is to avoid the update until they’re able to confirm that it’s working with key services. If you don’t have an IT department, you might want to hold off until you can gather feedback from co-workers or developers. Check in With Developers Finally, if you’ve installed custom software on your Nexus device and you’re unsure about how to proceed, you’ll want to get in touch with the developers and the Android community before installing the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update. A lot of the initial Android update problems we see come from people who are trying to sideload the software and those who are coming from a customized version of Android back to stock. If you aren’t running stock and you are thinking about sideloading or installing Android 5.1.1 down the road, keep an eye on your community. XDA-Developers is a great resource if you don’t know where to turn. 4 Responses 07/26/2015 Loris Prier Reply I have a message telling me to install a system download, but when I press the install button, nothing happens. Please respond by email with the necessary steps I need to take, or your phone number so we can discuss this. Thank you! 08/13/2015 I. Selby Reply Hi. I updated to Nexus 5.1.1 yesterday and am already experiencing a tiny but niggling issue. On some apps (not all, mostly games) the app used to just play normally, fulk screen, no issues. Now this ‘status bar’ will overlay itself, over the full screen game, covering part of the screen. It’s incredibly annoying and I haven’t worked out how to get rid of it. Furthermore, I use McAfee antivirus on my Nexus. On the home screen a tiny little green button appears that you can click to use it as a shortcut to open the app. This WAS helpful before the update but has now contributed to the pest nonsense by also making an appearance when the status bar issue occurs. Any idea on a fix? Woukd be greatly appreciated. I tried checking some options but couldn’t see anything. Preferably a fix without developer options btw as I know I can disable the bar completely but my ideal outcome is just to get it to stop becoming an overlay in various apps. It’s quite annoying. Thanks. 12/05/2016 rapid fire mods Reply I really like reading through a post that can make men and women think.

It’s one of the most popular games on Android and iOS, with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems. Like changing their name, transferring a village or switching to a new device. We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems. Instead, most of the questions being asked in forums are about minor things. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum. Then continue on for more details and help with some potential Clash of Clans problems. With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village. With that said we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account or village. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. Among other ways. Additionally, in January of 2017 the developers announced they are ending support for any device running iOS 5 or older. This doesn’t apply to most players, but if it does, learn more details here. Update your device or transfer your village before it’s too late. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail. Perfect in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Read: Clash of Clans Update Problems Frustrate Gamers The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Read: How to Fix Clash of Clans Device Not Compatible Error  With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors. Even the Clan War level can help you find the right one. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 73 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

From a free 43-inch HDTV, a free Google Home, buy one get one and more. Following months of leaks and rumors LG finally made their impressive new smartphone official on February 25th. Revealing a sleek new 5.7-inch LG G6 that’s water-resistant, has three cameras, and extremely slim bezels. It has a lot to offer and plenty of consumers are excited. Read: LG G6 Release Date Breakdown & Pricing In case you missed it, the LG G6 will be available to pre-order in the United States on March 17th. All major carriers have made announcements. It will start at $650 or $26 a month from T-Mobile, or nearly $700 from other carriers. It’s an expensive phone.

These are the best LG G6 deals and promotions Below buyers can find a continuously updating list of the absolute best LG G6 deals and discounts. Allowing you to not only get the hottest new phone, but save money at the same time. For more information on the LG G6 see our hands-on video, or check the link below. Then read on for some impressive launch-day deals. Read: LG G6 Features: 7 You’ll Love & 2 You’ll Hate For 2017 the company completely ditched the modular design we saw with the LG G5. It wasn’t popular, and instead their taking an approach similar to Samsung or Apple. The LG G6 is a premium all metal and glass phone. It has a huge screen, tiny bezels so its easy to hold, great cameras, and IP68 dust and water resistance. Additionally, there’s a micro-SD slot to expand storage and the latest Android 7.0 Nougat software. There’s a lot to like, so lets find some great discounts or savings before you buy one. LG G6 Deals First off, everyone who pre-orders or gets an LG G6 during the first month or so of it being available are in for a treat. As earlier announced, anyone who buys the LG G6 will get a free Google Home. The voice-controlled speaker and virtual assistant from Google, which is similar to Amazon Alexa. Simply buy an LG G6 and save your receipt. Then head to this LG promo website and fill it out to receive a free Google Home. That’s a $129 value absolutely free. It doesn’t matter which carrier, as any purchase applies. We were expecting some sort of free case or micro-SD deal like prior years, or to compete with Samsung but that doesn’t appear to be the case. Instead of expanding storage all owners will get the awesome Google Home. It’s a great product that many will enjoy. When you get it, say this command: “OK Google, I’m Feeling Lucky” and enjoy the results. Verizon LG G6 Deals In case you missed it in our release date breakdown, the LG G6 will be available from Verizon before any other US carrier. Pre-orders begin March 17th, and it will be available online and in stores starting March 30th. All other carriers will offer the G6 from April 7th. Get a free LG 43-inch Smart TV when you buy the LG G6 from Verizon Wireless. This is a limited time promotion, and we’re still looking for more details. Either way, once you buy the LG G6 from Verizon and get your free Google Home, head to this promotion website to claim your free 43-inch TV. This is one of the best deals we’ve seen in a while. As a reminder, the LG G6 is $28 a month for 24 months from Verizon, or $672 at full price. AT&T LG G6 Deals As the release date arrives and passes we can expect more deals and discounts to surface. Everyone is eligible for the free Google Home, so AT&T customers can start there. However, that isn’t all this carrier has to offer. Buy an LG G6 from AT&T and get one free. It isn’t actually free, but the carrier will simply credit your account $24 each month for $30 months, which is what you’ll pay for the first one. So it’s two for the price of one. Of course adding it to a plan will cost money, but you get the phone absolutely free. In addition to the buy one get one free deal, AT&T is also offering the new LG Watch Sport with Android Wear 2.0 for just $49.99 outright. As long as you sign a 2-year contract to have data on the watch. This is usually an extra $10 a month on your phone bill, but makes the watch work for calls and other things without being tethered to a phone. So get two LG G6 phones and LG’s newest smartwatch all for cheap with AT&T. T-Mobile, Sprint & Others As of right now we have no additional details regarding LG G6 deals from other carriers. We can expect T-Mobile to make some announcements in the near future, and Sprint may do the same just to compete with other carriers. Again, any carrier (including T-Mobile or Sprint) are eligible for the free Google Home. It doesn’t matter where you buy it, just head here and enter your information for a free Google Assistant-powered speaker. That being said, we can expect Best Buy to offer some sort of awesome deal too. Over the past few years they’ve been one of the best places to buy a smartphone. Typically offering at least a $100 discount over carrier pricing, in addition to a $100 Best Buy gift card. We’ve also seen them offer free microSD cards, discounts on accessories, and similar deals on a smartwatch. So while nothing has been announced yet, check back soon as this list will continuously be updated with the best LG G6 deals. While you’re here, take a look at these 10 Best LG G6 cases shown below. 15 Best LG G6 Cases Spigen Rugged Armor   1 / 15 Spigen is a brand that needs no introduction, as they've offered some of the best cases for almost every phone for the past couple of years. One of my favorites always happens to be the Spigen Rugged Armor. It has a sleek design, two-tone finish with a textured grip on the top and bottom, and fits with precision.  The company makes a wide assortment of cases, so we'd recommend choosing one that's right for you. They also come in a slew of colors, sizes, and with varying levels of protection.  With the Spigen Rugged Armor you'll have a case that isn't too thick, but not too thin. They've added a resilient shock absorber material to the inside edges for added drop protection, and finished it off with a carbon-fiber look and feel. It's available right now.  Buy it on Amazon for $14.99   1 / 15 2 Responses 03/16/2017 thinki'llpass Reply This would be the speaker that inflicts advertising on you in the (former) privacy of your own home? http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-home-tests-unsolicited-audio-ad-to-grumbles-2017-03-16 boyoboy, i can hardly wait… /s 03/18/2017 JENNIFER FREELAND Reply I love LG, I just can’t afford them until 2-3 new ones are already out.

Wochit Tech Tips for Online Privacy Online privacy is a hot topic. Many of the big-name websites and companies will track your activities to deliver targeted advertising, and can build up an astonishingly detailed profile including your interests, spending habits, age, location and more. If you would prefer to keep your personal details private, a VPN or proxy tool will help. As well as preventing third parties building up a profile of you, the best free privacy software can open up the web, granting you access to sites blocked in your country, to access region-locked content when you're traveling away from home, and to add a layer of protection when you use a public Wi-Fi network. To Get started, try these two programs: Tor Browser is probably the best-known anonymous browsing tool. It works by bouncing your communication through numerous encrypted nodes on the internet, making it impossible to determine your location or other identifying information. Privoxy is a web proxy tool. this free privacy software lets you set up advanced filters that will not only ensure you remain anonymous online, but also protect you against unwanted ads. Wochit Tech Galaxy S8 Will Be More Powerful in China Everyone expects the Samsung Galaxy S8 to be a powerful phone, but it could be even more powerful in China. Word has it that the Galaxy S8 may come with 6GB of RAM in China compared with 4GB for the rest of the world, according to IHS research director Kevin Wang. More RAM means your phone can do more things at once, like run a number of apps without bogging down. The Galaxy S8 is rumored to be coming with two different chipsets. Wochit Tech SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO The PlayStation 3 is about to die. Sony has announced that it will soon end production of the console in Japan. It's likely that it will stop being made everywhere else soon after. The company hasn't announced the date that production will come to an end, or made a public announcement about it. But on Sony's website it lists the 500GB standard model as the only one remaining in production in the country, and states that "shipments are scheduled to end soon". A tweet from a gaming shop in Japan suggests that shipments will come to an end in March. © Provided by Independent Print Limited The console was first released in November 2006. It was superceded in 2014, by the PlayStation 4. Sony has stated before that it works on a ten-year production cycle for all of its consoles, and so the console is coming to an end almost exactly as scheduled. The end of production doesn't mean that anything will happen to existing PlayStation consoles. But it does mean that support will likely be cut off soon – the company is likely to slow down updates at the same time, potentially meaning that problems with the online services and digital downloads could go unfixed for some time, or at all. It's likely that some consoles will continue to be sold throughout the year. But they will probably be in shorter supply, potentially pushing up the resale value of the system.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Google New Chrome 57 update will finally stop Google’s browser from melting your CPU Zach Epstein @zacharye March 15th, 2017 at 8:57 AM Share Tweet According to data from market research firm Net Applications, Google’s Chrome web browser is the most popular desktop browser in the world by a substantial margin. At last count, Chrome’s global market share sat at 58.53% in February, up slightly from 57.94% in the prior month. The #2 browser in the world, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, fell about half a point to 19.17% in February, and Firefox inches downward to 11.68% in the #3 spot. Chrome has plenty of advantages over rival browsers, which is why it has become so popular over the years despite Microsoft’s clear advantage — the company’s Internet Explorer and Edge browsers ship on every PC sold that runs Windows. Of course, Chrome still has its fair share of issues despite its popularity, and a new update released on Tuesday night addresses users’ biggest complaint. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 “Efficient power usage is an important aspect of speed, one of Chrome’s key pillars,” Google’s Alexander Timin wrote in a post on the company’s Chromium blog. “To prolong battery life, Chrome should minimize power impact from things users can’t see. This includes background tabs, which consume a third of Chrome’s power usage on desktop. Starting in version 57, Chrome will throttle individual background tabs by limiting the timer fire rate for background tabs using excessive power.” As anyone who uses the Chrome web browser can attest to, the software can be something of a resource hog when multiple tabs are open in the background. There is perhaps no desktop application that causes more PC fans to kick on around the world than Chrome. That may now come to an end, however, as Chrome 57 marks the start of more effective background tab throttling that puts better limits on resource utilization. “Chrome has focused on improving the user experience by throttling tab performance for many years,” Timin wrote. “Like many browsers, Chrome has limited timers in the background to only run once per second. Via the new throttling policy, Chrome 57 will delay timers to limit average CPU load to 1% of a core if an application uses too much CPU in background. Tabs playing audio or maintaining real-time connections like WebSockets or WebRTC won’t be affected.” The Google engineer noted that Chrome 57’s new background tab throttling mechanism typically results in 25% fewer busy tabs running in the background.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Google accused of `profiting from hatred´ by MPs over YouTube advertising system By Press Association Published: 04:18 EDT, 18 March 2017 | Updated: 04:18 EDT, 18 March 2017 e-mail Google has been asked to explain itself after Government adverts were placed on “inappropriate and hate-filled sites”. The technology giant has been accused of “profiting from hatred” by MPs over its YouTube advertising system that saw taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist content on the video site. The Home Affairs Select Committee has now written to Google asking for an explanation. YouTube also said they do no proactive work to tackle illegal posts - not even on terrorism or online child abuse. Was shocked by that.— Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) March 14, 2017 The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”, while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. Google's Peter Barron was grilled by the Home Affairs select committee earlier this week (PA) In a letter to Google’s communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. “As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. “In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers.” Labour's Yvette Cooper chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee (PA) The internet giant’s UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat what it called “bad advertising”. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. “With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right. The logo of internet search engine Google reflected in a pair of glasses “In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies,” he said. “We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.” However, Ms Cooper said the company’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” towards the content was “extremely troubling”. Ms Cooper said Google's lack of action was worrying (PA) “It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content,” she said. “The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube’s very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred.” Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

TAG Heuer on Tuesday unveiled the new generation of a US$1,650 (RM7,322) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the US$890 Summit. Also on Thursday, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” US$15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as US$10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about US$15,000.  The original version of the Apple Watch starts at US$269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra US$1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a US$17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Hacked websites on the rise, Google confirms Singapore beats Silicon Valley for start-up talents, survey finds Adobe, Microsoft team up to share sales and marketing data Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Tiger Woods signs copies of his new book ‘The 1997 Masters: My Story’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles TAG Heuer gets smart with the Connected Modular 45 Is the MyKronoz ZeTime the future of smartwatch design?

The technology giant has been accused of "profiting from hatred" by MPs over its YouTube advertising system that saw taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist content on the video site. The Home Affairs Select Committee has now written to Google asking for an explanation. The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising "pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way", while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google's advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos.  In a letter to Google's communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: "Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. "As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. "In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers." The internet giant's UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company "can and must do more" to combat what it called "bad advertising". "We've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. "With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don't always get it right. "In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies," he said. "We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more." However, Ms Cooper said the company's "lack of effort and social responsibility" towards the content was "extremely troubling".  "It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content," she said. "The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube's very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred."  Media advertising firm GroupM has suggested "a 100% foolproof system" to prevent further incidents may not be possible. The firm, which is part of advertising giant WPP, also warned that Google and YouTube's tools to stop bad advert placement were "not infallible" in a letter to clients.  GroupM's chief digital officer Rob Norman said the technology giant should apologise over the incident.  "We believe Google owes two apologies, one to advertisers for compromising their brand reputations and the other to consumers for the presence of the content," he said. "Google should also make clear that the flaw is in Google's controls, so no consumer may think that a brand, through its adjacency, is an endorser of the content." 18 March 2017 7:15AM View comments Most Commented Win a £1,000 garden makeover with Quattro Products and the News & Star 65 Midwife facing disciplinary action after speaking out about hospital maternity decision 10 Work set to start on controversial castle crossing in Carlisle 8 Carlisle amputee teen hit with SECOND hospital parking ticket 4 Sturgeon plans to trigger second Scotland independence vote 3 Most Read 16,000 chickens killed in huge fire near Carlisle Carlisle girl, 10, told she wouldn't get school dinner because of £4 debt Young north Cumbrian woman killed in crash Three arrested after bloody incident in Carlisle Woman who died in tragic Cumbrian crash named More news   Inflation is forecast to come in just shy of the Bank of England's 2% target Food and fuel prices set to push up inflation Martin McGuinness has died aged 66 Martin McGuinness dies aged 66 Yorkshire's new captain Gary Ballance has signed a new deal Gary Ballance signs two-year extension to Yorkshire contract Chief Superintendent Mark Pannone Cumbria police deal with huge increase in mental health crisis cases Wales' George North, left, complained about an alleged bite during the game against France Six Nations officials: No evidence found over alleged bite on George North Quick searches Carlisle Airport Carlisle United Court cases Cumberland Infirmary Sellafield West Cumberland Hospital Featured articles   Don't get caught out with new mobile phone laws: find out the dos and don'ts Venus shining brightly in the night sky Why the planet Venus is shining so bright in the Cumbrian night sky JOBS PROPERTY MOTORS LOCAL BUSINESSES READER TRAVEL BUY PHOTOS PLACE AN AD DATING Contact Us News & Star Newspaper House, Dalston Road Carlisle, Cumbria CA2 5UA 01228 612600 Contact us online here Facebook Twitter YouTube Sitemap Home | News | Carlisle Utd | Sport | Motors | Property | Jobs | Contact Us | Lifestyle | Family Notices | Buy photos | Place an ad | Buy and Sell | Readers Travel | Subscriptions | Business Directory | Dating | Pets in Cumbria Services Subscriptions | Jobs | Property | Motors | Travel | Dating | Family Notices | Pets CN Group News & Star | Cumberland News | Times & Star | Whitehaven News | Hexham Courant | NW Evening Mail | Eskdale & Liddesdale Advertiser | Cumbria Life | Carlisle Living | Dumfries and Galloway Life | in-cumbria | The Bay | Lakeland Radio | Cumbria Live | Choose Cumbria | CN-Jobs | clickin2 | Business directory | Reader holidays | CN Group | Privacy policy © 2017 CN Group back to top

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Max Chafkin and Mark Bergen Travis Kalanick, the chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc., says he needs leadership help. He recently dispatched former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate sexual harassment claims against the company. His security team is reviewing a practice known as “Greyballing.” And he’s no longer planning to go to meetings with President Trump. These damage-control initiatives—in response, respectively, to a leaked video in which Kalanick was rude to an Uber driver, a blog post by a former engineer, an admission that the company had been deliberately misleading police, and a customer boycott—were the result of a month’s worth of public-relations disasters. Taken alone, any of these would have been enough to slow down the famously fast-moving ride-hailing company. Taken together, they’ve caused some to question Uber’s viability and Kalanick’s staying power. But none of these scandals has the potential financial impact of the one Uber has said the least about: a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc.—the parent of Google and Google’s self-driving car division, now called Waymo—over driverless cars. Waymo says Uber is in possession of, and is basing the future of its business on, technology that was stolen by a former employee. Self-driving technology has become a fixation for Kalanick. Developing a driverless car, he’s often said, is “existential” to Uber. If a competitor managed to get there first, it could easily replicate Uber’s core service (shuttling passengers) without its single largest cost (paying drivers). Over the course of a few weeks in 2015, Kalanick poached 40 researchers from the Carnegie Mellon University robotics lab, one of the country’s top autonomous vehicle research centers. Then, last summer, Uber became the first company to operate a fleet of autonomous taxis, in downtown Pittsburgh. On the day it announced that service, Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded in January 2016 by a former Google employee, Anthony Levandowski. The 37-year-old engineer was an original member of Google’s car team and a protégé of its creator, Sebastian Thrun. At Google, Levandowski had been both a brilliant engineer and a divisive manager, with a reputation for flouting corporate norms and skirting rules to get cars on the road as quickly as possible. He was so controversial, according to several former and current employees, that when he was being considered to lead the car team, a group of engineers revolted, causing Alphabet CEO Larry Page to rethink the choice and install a different leader, Chris Urmson. According to the legal complaint filed on behalf of Google’s driverless car division—as almost everyone at Waymo still refers to it—the company began investigating Levandowski last summer after learning that Uber had paid about $700 million for his months-old company. Google’s suit, filed in a San Francisco federal court, says its investigators uncovered a trove of digital evidence that hint at an unprecedented theft. According to the suit, Levandowski used his company laptop to download 14,000 design files from Google’s car project. He plugged a memory card reader into the laptop and, shortly afterward, wiped all the data from the laptop. The suit also alleges that two other Otto employees took files on their way out the door. Google seemed content to sit on that information until Dec. 13, when a Google employee received an email from a supplier that was working on components for the lidar sensor in the company’s first production car. Lidar—a portmanteau of “light” and “radar”—is the key component that allows an autonomous vehicle to, essentially, see its surroundings. (It’s also used to build maps.) Off-the-shelf sensors cost up to $80,000 and contain several individual lenses. Under Levandowski, who’d led the lidar team, Google developed a much cheaper version that used a single lens. Strangely, though, the email’s subject line—“Otto Files”— made reference to Levandowski’s company. According to Google’s suit, the contents of the email, which seemed to have been intended for Uber rather than Google, included a machine drawing of a lidar circuit board that had Otto’s name on it but looked almost identical to Google’s. Two months later, Waymo sued Uber for trade secret theft and patent infringement, seeking damages and an injunction that could seriously impede Uber’s self-driving car program. At issue is a business that both companies believe will be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars a year. And though both companies like to portray driverless cars as some near-term inevitability, this dispute shows just how messy the race to get there could prove to be. During new-hire orientation, engineers at Google are frequently told that the company will never sue a former employee for patent infringement. The implication is twofold: first, that Google doesn’t stoop to fighting over patents, though it may employ them to protect itself from people who aren’t in the business of changing the world. (“These patent wars are death,” Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at an event in 2012, calling patent litigation “bad for innovation.”) And, as an extension of that, if Google sues you over a patent issue, you must have really pissed them off. After the lawsuit was filed, Uber released a statement characterizing it as “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” At an all-hands meeting at the company’s Pittsburgh research center, Levandowski defended Uber’s lidar technology as “clean”—that is, not the product of stolen design documents—and told the company’s engineers that he’d downloaded the files to work from home. Some former colleagues seem to think that even if Levandowski did what Google alleges, he doesn’t deserve to be punished. “Whatever Google may say about him stealing lidar trade secrets, he was the lidar team at Google,” says someone who worked at the company’s driverless car program. “This is like the Swiss patent office suing Einstein for inventing the theory of relativity while he worked there.” The comparison to Einstein is obviously hyperbolic, but it also captures the foundational role Levandowski played in the development of self-driving cars. Levandowski, 6-foot-6 and relentlessly intense, is as much an entrepreneur as he is an engineer. At 16 he started a web design firm that a former colleague says made him a millionaire by the end of high school. (Levandowski didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.) As a University of California at Berkeley undergraduate, he won a national competition sponsored by Lego—he built a toy robot that could sort Monopoly money. Levandowski was 22 and working toward an MBA and an industrial engineering master’s at Berkeley when he first heard about the Darpa Grand Challenge. (His mother read about it and mentioned it to him.) The 2004 competition, organized by the U.S. Department of Defense, involved a race for robotic cars on a 150-mile course in the Mojave Desert. It drew teams from Carnegie Mellon, the California Institute of Technology, a number of defense contractors, and most of the other big names in robotics. Levandowski led a ragtag team of Berkeley graduate students and research assistants. If there was hubris in entering, there was even more in his chosen design. Ghostrider, his self-balancing, self-driving motorcycle, was the only two-wheel vehicle in the contest. “I was assuming the driving part would be easy to solve,” he said last summer, speaking to Bloomberg Businessweek in a joint interview with Kalanick shortly before Uber announced its acquisition of Otto. “I wanted to make something actually difficult.” Although it failed to stay upright on race day—a grainy YouTube video documenting Ghostrider’s run is six seconds long—the bike was still seen as an achievement by Levandowski’s peers, partly because no team finished. (Ghostrider eventually became part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection.) For the next competition, in 2005, Levandowski served as the team leader for Ghostrider while also working on lidar sensors for the winning team from Stanford, which was managed by Thrun. Levandowski and two Berkeley friends adapted the technology from Ghostrider, which had used GPS and cheap digital cameras, into a commercial product. Their company, 510 Systems LLC, sold camera systems, and eventually lidar, to mapping companies, including Nokia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Levandowski also sold kits to automate agricultural and construction equipment. In 2007, Google hired Thrun’s team from Stanford to work on a new product, Street View, formally making Levandowski a full-time employee of the search company even as he continued to run 510. The initial plan was to supplement Google’s maps, which at the time used data licensed from the mapping giant Navteq Corp., with pictures of city streets. Levandowski suggested that Thrun’s mapping technology could allow Google to replace Navteq’s data altogether. His mapping initiative was seen as an enormous success, allowing Google to offer on phones turn-by-turn driving directions that were as good as those offered by standalone GPS device makers. In 2008, while doing double-duty at Google and 510, he took a call from a producer at the Discovery Channel who wanted to borrow Ghostrider for an episode of Prototype This!, a short-lived documentary series. Levandowski suggested instead that he use a different vehicle. He asked Google for permission to embark on the stunt using sensors similar to those on Google’s mapping cars. It was granted on the condition that Levandowski, and not Google, would be responsible if something went wrong. “The lawyers said, ‘Absolutely, but please don’t put Google on the side,’?” Levandowski told Bloomberg Businessweek in the interview last summer. “So we started this thing called Anthony’s Robots to be very clear it wasn’t Google-related.” A few weeks later, under a police escort and with cameras rolling, the Pribot, as Pribot, as Levandowski named his converted Toyota Prius, successfully crossed the San Francisco Bay Bridge.Prius, successfully crossed the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Google’s self-driving car project began the following year with a modified Prius that used software created by Prius that used software created by Thrun at Stanford and hardware supplied by Anthony’s Robots. Like 510 Systems, Anthony’s Robots was operated as an independent company. The arrangement—whereby Levandowski was at once a founding member of the Google self-driving car team and a vendor who was also selling technology to other companies—was well-known to Google executives, though it was never publicly disclosed. “Anthony is a rogue force of nature,” says a former Google self-driving car executive. “Each phase of his Google career he had a separate company doing exactly the same work.” According to two former Google employees, founders Page and Sergey Brin tolerated Brin tolerated Levandowski’s freelancing because they saw it as the fastest way to make progress. Google’s car team embraced Levandowski’s nature, too. The attitude, says a former colleague, was “he’s an asshole, but he’s our asshole.” As Google’s car project grew, a debate raged inside the company, reflecting a broader dispute about the direction of autonomous vehicles: Should the tech come gradually and be added to cars with drivers (through features like automatic parking and highway autopilot) or all at once (for instance, a fleet of fully autonomous cars operating in a city center)? Urmson, a former Carnegie Mellon professor, preferred the latter approach, arguing that incremental innovations might, paradoxically, make cars less safe. Levandowski believed otherwise and argued that Google should sell self-driving kits that could be retrofitted on cars, former colleagues say. Urmson won out, and according to two former employees, Levandowski sulked openly. After one dispute between the two, Levandowski stopped coming to work for months, devoting his time to his side projects. This didn’t stop Page and Brin from discreetly acquiring 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots for roughly $50 million in 2011.Brin from discreetly acquiring 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots for roughly $50 million in 2011. As Google’s driverless car program matured, Levandowski seemed to become impatient. Creating a fully functioning driverless car means training a complicated hardware and software system to identify lane lines and red lights and to control the car’s movements. It also means writing software that anticipates thousands of unlikely “edge cases”—hairpin turns, drivers who use hand signals, covered bridges, recumbent bikes, and so on. That work seemed to bore Levandowski. He became increasingly frustrated at Google’s inability to operate its cars on city streets and decided to take matters into his own hands. “Engineers were like, ‘We are totally ready to go,’ and I’m like, ‘Let’s go then. Let’s see whether it’s real or a demo,’?” Levandowski said in the summer interview. Without formally telling Google, which considered its cars not yet ready for open-road tests, he hired a lobbyist in Nevada and wrote a law that allowed companies to test autonomous cars with so-called safety drivers. (Self-driving car companies use the term to describe an engineer who sits in the driver’s seat with her hands on the wheel in case the car malfunctions.) The law passed at the end of 2011, though Google hasn’t conducted large-scale tests in the state. Google’s government relations department learned about Levandowski’s Nevada efforts when the lobbyist, David Goldwater, sent the company an invoice. Levandowski first met Kalanick in 2011 at a TED conference, but the two didn’t become close until early 2016, after Levandowski pitched Kalanick on an investment in Otto. Kalanick didn’t invest—but he did begin meeting with Levandowski in secret. In the interview with Bloomberg Businessweek at the time of the acquisition, Kalanick described these rendezvous in detail: The two would go to the San Francisco Ferry Building after sunset, entering separately and each picking up takeout food. They’d begin walking west toward the Golden Gate Bridge, where they’d eventually join up and begin talking. Kalanick recalled that he and Levandowski went on five or so of these walks, each one lasting several hours. Kalanick, now 40, was taken by the younger man’s hustle and sense of purpose, describing him as a “brother from another mother.” To get self-driving cars to production, Kalanick said in the interview, “it can’t just be about science. It has to be about engineering and entrepreneurialism that takes us into the real world. That’s where Anthony and I connect, right?”entrepreneurialism that takes us into the real world. That’s where Anthony and I connect, right?” Levandowski, who was sitting next to him, nodded. “We think very similarly in terms of how do we get things out onto the world fastest,” he said. “How do we make a difference, how do we make impact, how do we get people using our technology.” Levandowski hinted that he’d decided to break with Google and start Otto in part out of frustration at the slow pace of innovation at Google. That might not have been the whole story. On March 10, Google, which is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop Uber from using its technology, filed written testimony from Pierre-Yves Droz, Droz, Levandowski’s co-founder at 510 Systems and the technical lead on Google’s lidar program. Droz wrote that in the summer of 2015 Droz wrote that in the summer of 2015 Levandowski said Uber might be interested in “buying the team” and that in January 2016 he told Droz he would “replicate” the company’s Droz he would “replicate” the company’s lidar. When Levandowski quit to start Otto, he was escorted out by Google security. A handful of Google employees soon followed him to the new company. Soon after, Levandowski began making trips to Uber’s self-driving car research center in Pittsburgh, where a staff that had grown to 500 was scrambling to launch the pilot taxi service. Levandowski wasn’t widely introduced; senior managers believed he was a consultant. “As far as the team knew,” says a former employee, Levandowski was “some guy who would come around and be annoying.” At Otto’s San Francisco headquarters, the startup, which had 90 or so employees, prepared for its product launch in May. Down a stretch of Nevada highway, the company ran a self-driving big-rig truck kitted out with sensors and computer controllers. Documents uncovered by the tech publication Backchannel showed that Levandowksi had sought the approval of state regulators to film the demo. When they denied his request to do the run, he went through with it anyway. (Goldwater, again serving as kitted out with sensors and computer controllers. Documents uncovered by the tech publication Backchannel showed that Levandowksi had sought the approval of state regulators to film the demo. When they denied his request to do the run, he went through with it anyway. (Goldwater, again serving as Levandowski’s lobbyist, argued in an email to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles that it had no jurisdiction in the matter. A senior DMV administrator called the test “illegal” in an internal email but declined to rebuke Otto publicly.) In August, Uber acquired Otto for roughly $700 million in company stock. The plan, Kalanick said, was to continue building Otto’s trucking business and to use the startup’s homegrown lidar to beef up Uber’s own self-driving cars, all under Levandowski’s supervision. Uber’s Pittsburgh team learned of the acquisition, and the fact that they had a new boss, the day it was announced. “The team was super unhappy,” says a former employee. It turned out that Otto’s lidar was a work in progress—the company’s prototype trucks were still using sensors manufactured by Velodyne Velodyne Lidar Inc. “We thought we were getting some supersecret sauce by joining them,” says the employee. “But they did smoke and mirrors and got a huge acquisition offer.” Over the next six months, about 15 of the original 40 Carnegie Mellon engineers left. At least three have subsequently founded competing self-driving car companies, one of which recently received a $1 billion investment over five years from Ford Motor Co.supersecret sauce by joining them,” says the employee. “But they did smoke and mirrors and got a huge acquisition offer.” Over the next six months, about 15 of the original 40 Carnegie Mellon engineers left. At least three have subsequently founded competing self-driving car companies, one of which recently received a $1 billion investment over five years from Ford Motor Co. Levandowski seemed to struggle in other ways as well. In December, Uber dispatched 16 self-driving cars, with safety drivers, in San Francisco without seeking a permit from the California DMV. The test went poorly—on the first day, a self-driving car ran a red light, and the DMV ordered Uber to halt its program in the state. The company suffered further embarrassment when a New York Times article, citing leaked documents, suggested that Uber’s explanation for the traffic violation—that it had been caused by human error—wasn’t complete. The car malfunctioned, and the driver failed to stop it. The misdirection came as no surprise to the Uber employees who’d spent time at Otto’s San Francisco headquarters. Someone there had distributed stickers—in OSHA orange—with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: “Safety third.” In Silicon Valley, litigation is looked upon as the last refuge of the undisruptiveundisruptive Uber has yet to file a legal response to Google’s complaint—a spokeswoman says it plans to do so later this month—but the company essentially has two options: It can settle with Waymo and license its sensors, or it can fight. “What Waymo probably wants is to license its patents to Uber,” says Robert Gomulkiewicz, a former Microsoft intellectual-property lawyer who’s now a professor at the University of Washington School of Law. “In this kind of litigation, that’s the typical sequence of events.”Gomulkiewicz, a former Microsoft intellectual-property lawyer who’s now a professor at the University of Washington School of Law. “In this kind of litigation, that’s the typical sequence of events.” That said, this isn’t a typical patent dispute, and Uber isn’t a typical company. If it fights, it could argue, as Levandowski did at the all-hands meeting in Pittsburgh, that the alleged document dump was simply part of an effort on his part to work from home. It could also cite how Google seemed to encourage Levandowski’s freelance excursions. And while many of his former colleagues assume that Google wouldn’t sue Levandowski if the forensic evidence wasn’t incontrovertible—that is, if it didn’t have him dead to rights—other former colleagues and some industry insiders see the lawsuit as evidence that Google is struggling to make up for its failure to bring a product to market quickly. “Google is the Xerox Parc of self-driving cars,” says George Hotz, the founder of Comma.ai, another autonomous car startup. It’s a backhanded compliment: Although Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center invented the modern computer operating system, it didn’t bring the invention to market; Apple Inc. did. “The real question is, why hasn’t Google shipped?” Hotz asks. He regards Google’s lawsuit as a deliberate conflation of two different beefs. The first—the accusation that Parc of self-driving cars,” says George Hotz, the founder of Comma.ai, another autonomous car startup.

Whatever Levandowski did with Google’s files, he’s not wrong that Google has struggled to commercialize technology that’s widely regarded as the best in the automotive industry. Before Google worked on its current prototype, a two-seater that has a top speed of 20 miles per hour and vaguely resembles a koala bear, the company pitched Elon Musk on outfitting his electric Tesla vehicles with Google tech, according to two people familiar with the deal. Musk passed and a few years later launched Tesla Inc.’s highway autopilot service on his own. A former Google executive says John Krafcik, who joined the car project as CEO in 2015, would sometimes appear rattled by the competitive moves of Tesla and Uber, wondering aloud if Google may have already been “leapfrogged.” He would grow particularly irritable “every time Elon would post something on Twitter,” the executive says. Levandowski hasn’t shown any sign of being rattled or contrite. Three days after the lawsuit hit, he appeared onstage in Barcelona as a marquee speaker at the Mobile World Congress. The lawsuit never came up. As a final question, the moderator, the chief marketing officer of a cell phone industry trade group, simply asked, “Do you drive?” Levandowski smiled. “Sometimes I drive, and sometimes I’m driven,” he said. “That’s the beauty of being able to work on this project—you get to see the technology evolve and get better over time.” “Absolutely fascinating stuff,” the moderator replied. “Please, everyone: a round of applause for Anthony.” The crowd, stacked with top executives from the world’s biggest companies, complied enthusiastically.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Google Assistant is not coming to tablets, says company Google Assistant is not coming to tablets, says company Google is restricting the Assistant to just smartphones for now, with tablets being left out By: Tech Desk | Published:March 18, 2017 1:03 pm Google Assistant will be restricted to smartphones for now. Google Assistant has moved beyond the Pixel smartphones, and if your phone is running Android 7.0 Nougat and above versions or Android Marshmallow you should have the virtual assistant on your device. But it looks like Google is restricting the Assistant to just smartphones for now. In a statement to Android Police, Google confirmed: the Assistant is not coming to tablets just yet, which is strange. The statement reads, “The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets.” It’s not clear why Google has decided to restrict Assistant to just smartphones, but this could change later on. After all, Google Assistant was supposed to be exclusive to the Pixel smartphones, when they were first launched in October 2016, but all that has changed since then. Google Assistant got into a bit of trouble earlier this week as well, after users of the Google Home speaker reported about an ad for ‘Beauty and the Beast’ was played by the device at the end of weather updates. Google in a statement to The Verge denied the audio was an ad, but admitted it should have handled this better. Google’s statement reads, “This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” But then another user pointed out the ad was also playing on the Google Assistant on the Nexus 5X. For now, it looks like Google has pulled the ad. Ad or no ad, Google Assistant is viewed as the way forward for search and interactions on smartphones. So it is strange that the AI is not coming to Android tablets, which are still used by many customers. Google Assistant will also see enhanced third-party support in 2017; Google opened up the API for this last year. It means the Assistant will soon lets users book an Uber or order food from a restaurant via a supporting app. Other OEMs like Samsung, HTC are planning to add their own smart assistant to phones. Lenovo-owned Motorola already announced the Amazon Alexa, voice-assistant will be coming to its phones this year.

By Kedar Grandhi March 18, 2017 07:23 GMT This withdrawal is amid Youtube displaying ads of many brands next to content promoting extremismReuters French multinational advertising and PR firm Havas pulled out its entire UK digital ad spending from Google and YouTube on Friday, 17 March. The company confirmed the same, but said this withdrawal would be limited to its UK business. This follows a similar withdrawal from many major UK brands and the UK government departments. They withdrew their advertisements after discovering it was appearing next to content promoting extremism. Paul Frampton, Havas UK chief executive and country manager, was quoted as saying by the Guardian: "We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace to position their brands in the right context where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands' objectives." "Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network's ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect," he added. Ads of the Home Office, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, Transport For London, Argos and Sainsbury's among many others were found to be being displayed alongside videos for racists, white supremacists, rape apologists and other such videos that advocate extremism. Following this, many brands and the UK Government said they would withdraw their ads from the Google platforms until the American tech giant would take necessary action to resolve the same. Havas is one of the world's biggest marketing agency whose annual digital spend in the UK alone stands at about £175m ($217m). A few news reports had said recently that Havas would consider a global freeze on YouTube and Google ads. However, according to the latest from a Havas spokeswoman, the rest of the group will not withdraw its ads from either of the two platforms. "The decision of our UK team to pause activity with our partner Google is a temporary move made by the local team on behalf of our UK clients and their specific needs. We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK," she was quoted as saying by Reuters. Meanwhile, Yannick Bollore CEO at Havas tweeted he was not even aware of its British unit's decision. Google on its part has already publicly apologised for this issue. It said it had worked hard to prevent ads from appearing on pages or videos with "hate speech, gory or offensive content". It added that it would launch a review to give brands who advertise on its platform more control over where their ads should appear.

The US company said in a blog post yesterday it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the UK government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its UK clients’ ads from Google and YouTube yesterday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail Plc, government-owned British Broadcasting Corp, Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said in a statement. “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect," said Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the UK, and called its UK unit’s decision “a temporary move.” “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis,” a Havas spokeswoman wrote in an email. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the UK government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Google made US$7.8 billion (RM34.6 billion) in advertising revenue in the UK in 2016, accounting for 8.6 per cent of the company’s total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Online clash Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook Inc, claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. The controversy about ads appearing in inappropriate contexts may give these media buyers leverage in negotiations with the social media giants. Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive officer of WPP, the global advertising firm, said in a statement that Google and Facebook have “the same responsibilities as any media company” and could not “masquerade” as mere technology platforms. He said WPP’s GroupM, a major ad buyer, was talking to Google “at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues.” Ronan Harris, Google’s UK managing director, said in the blog post that Google removed nearly two billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company’s ad sense programme. Despite this, Harris wrote, “we don’t always get it right.” Harris said Google had “heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content.” Policy review The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said. Ads appeared “next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube parent Google, the British publisher said in an emailed statement yesterday. The UK government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure they’re not placed next to content it doesn’t approve of. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,” the UK government said in an emailed statement. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.” Britain, Germany Britain’s government said it summoned Google for discussions to explain how it can guarantee the state’s demands are met, while on Tuesday Germany threatened to fine social networks such as Facebook as much as €50 million (RM238.5 million) if they fail to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refuse to remove illegal content. British supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc, whose ads appeared on videos posted by the white nationalist Polish Defence League, said it and its sister brand Argos would immediately suspend all Google advertising. “It is unacceptable that Google is allowing our ads to be placed alongside these videos on YouTube,” the company said in an emailed statement. It said it was seeking “urgent assurances” from Google that the problems were being addressed. The Guardian said it would be withdrawing its advertising until Google could provide guarantees that the ad misplacement wouldn’t happen in future. “It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” Guardian News & Media said.

(Source: Bloomberg) Google, the primary revenue driver for Alphabet Inc., announced changes to its advertising policies after major brands pulled ads from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive content, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism. The U.S. company said in a blog post Friday it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the UK government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its U.K. clients’ ads from Google and YouTube on Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail Plc, government-owned British Broadcasting Corp., Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said in a statement. Also Read: YouTube announces its live streaming service to take on cable TV “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect,” said Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the UK, and called its UK unit’s decision “a temporary move.” “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis,” a Havas spokeswoman wrote in an email. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the UK government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook Inc., claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. ( Image for representation, Source: Youtube) Google made $7.8 billion in advertising revenue in the UK in 2016, accounting for 8.6 percent of the company’s total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Online Clash Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook Inc., claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. The controversy about ads appearing in inappropriate contexts may give these media buyers leverage in negotiations with the social media giants. Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive officer of WPP, the global advertising firm, said in a statement that Google and Facebook have “the same responsibilities as any media company” and could not “masquerade” as mere technology platforms. The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos (Source: Bloomberg) He said WPP’s GroupM, a major ad buyer, was talking to Google “at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues.” Ronan Harris, Google’s U.K. managing director, said in the blog post that Google removed nearly 2 billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company’s ad sense program. Despite this, Harris wrote, “we don’t always get it right.” Harris said Google had “heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content.” Policy Review The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said.

Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Taylor Martin March 14, 2017 6:00 AM PDT @caspertek Top 5 things Amazon's Alexa can do that Google Home can't Amazon's head start in the smart speaker market makes Alexa hard to beat. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:32 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF While Google Home can do a lot that the Echo can't -- like contextual conversations or throwing images and videos to your televisions -- it has plenty of catching-up to do with Amazon Echo's Alexa. Google is always adding new features to Home, so that list continues to shrink, but there are still seven things we wish it could do. One technical note: Throughout this piece, Google Assistant is often compared to Amazon Alexa, as those are the voice-assistance technologies within these devices. Just remember that the way Google Assistant works on Google Home is much more limited than the way it works on phones. 49 Here's everything the Amazon Echo can do Track packages Since you can order items using Alexa, it only makes sense that you can track orders placed through Amazon with Alexa, as well. All you have to say is, "Alexa, where's my stuff?" She won't give you a ton of details, like where the package currently is or the status of the shipment, but she will tell you the day it's estimated to arrive. Seeing as this is a feature already integrated into Google Assistant on phones, it's likely only a matter of time before Google Home can also track orders placed with practically any online retailer. But there is no mention of package tracking in the long list of features of Google Home. If you ask Google Home to track your package today, she'll just say, "I can't do that yet." Yet! Amazon Music and Prime Music Chris Monroe/CNET The music and radio services officially supported by Google Home at launch were Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn. Support for iHeartRadio was rolled out at the end of February. With Amazon's Alexa speakers, you get support for the same music services, save for Google Play Music and YouTube Music. Instead, you get support for Amazon's in-house streaming services, Amazon Music and Prime Music. Despite not officially supporting Amazon Music or Prime Music -- which isn't all that surprising given they are competitors -- you can stream almost any audio to Google Home by casting from a phone or tablet. The Amazon Music app does not support Chromecast, however, so you can't stream audio from the app to Google Home using an iOS device. However, there is a workaround for Android devices. Begin playing music from within the Amazon Music app, pull down the notification shade, tap the Cast logo, and select your Google Home from the list to stream the audio through the speaker. Read books out loud One of Alexa's greatest features is the ability to play audiobooks from Audible or read your Kindle books, simply by asking. Say, "Alexa, play 'A Walk in the Woods'" or "Alexa, read 'Ready Player One.'" Google Home doesn't come with any official support for playing audiobooks or reading e-books (not surprising considering the companies are competitors), which is unfortunate and surprising, especially considering the built-in Read Aloud feature in Google Play Books. Of course, while you can't queue up an audiobook or have Google Home read an e-book with a voice command, you can use the same workaround mentioned above to stream the audio through the Google Home speaker. Play the audiobook or select Read Aloud in the Google Play Books app, pull down the notification shade, tap the Cast icon and select your Google Home speaker to begin streaming the audio. Still, this doesn't work with Kindle books. You will have had to have purchased the book from Google to stream the Read Aloud feature to Google Home, which might fragment your digital library. Multiple designs Unless you have an Android phone that supports Google Assistant, Google Home is the only way you can bring Assistant into your household. Chris Monroe/CNET Since the launch of Echo, Amazon has added smaller and more portable options to its lineup. The Echo Dot is a cheaper, low-profile way to add more Alexa to your house; the Tap lets you take Alexa on the go -- no wires needed. As mentioned, we suspect Google will allow other speaker-makers build Assistant into their devices. But until one hits the market, Amazon has the advantage when it comes to giving you multiple design options. Voice remote Sarah Tew/CNET If you just want to be able to control your Echo from out of typical voice range, all you need is an Alexa Voice Remote for $30. To accomplish the same thing with Google Home, you will need to add a second Google Home for $129 a pop (currently only available in the US, that directly converts to about £106, AU$171). Third-party apps CNET Amazon lets developers harness the power of Alexa within applications, such as Roger and Ubi. One developer created an online tool -- called Echosim.io -- so developers can test their skills without needing to own the hardware. As a plus, now anyone can take Alexa for a test drive in their browser. Aside from streaming audio, these virtual versions of Alexa work exactly the same as the official devices from Amazon, meaning you can get the full effect of Alexa before ever having to spend a dime on Amazon's speakers. For now, the best way to test Google Home is by using Google Assistant on a compatible Android phone. DIY Alexa In March of 2016, Amazon released an API for Alexa Voice Service (AVS), the service which powers the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap. This allowed developers and users to put Alexa on custom hardware, like Raspberry Pi. It also allows third-party manufacturers to build their own Alexa speakers (or Alexa-powered computers.) So, if you don't like Amazon's speakers, there are third-party or homebrew options to choose from, like the Matrix Creator, an add-on board for Raspberry Pi. Editors' note: This article was updated March 13, 2017 to update information regarding new Google Home features and Google Assistant availability. Previously included in this list were Alexa skills, voice shopping and official iHeartRadio support. The ability for Alexa to read Kindle books was also added.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The Samsung Galaxy S8, Google Pixel 2 and OnePlus 5 are three highly-anticipated devices of this year, and all three will undoubtedly pack some amazing specs and features that can create a rage in the market. Various reports have tried to speculate about the configuration these devices will come with. There have been a plethora of leaks, most of the Galaxy S8 smartphone. If one is open to choosing a great mobile and is not a brand loyalist, here’s a comparison of the possible specs these mobile phones will sport. OnePlus broke into the competitive smartphone scene by primarily releasing pocket-friendly flagships. Recent leaks have revealed that the company will be coming up with the OnePlus 5 handset this year. Google has also confirmed at the MWC 2017 that the Pixel 2 is on the way. There are talks that the OnePlus flagship will come with a 5.5-inch dual-curved edge AMOLED display, like the one in Galaxy S7 Edge. A 1440p QHD resolution is a big possibility though the exact display details are not yet available. The Galaxy and OnePlus sets will run on Android 7.0 Nougat and pack the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. For the global markets, Samsung may release an Exynos 8995 SoC variant. The OnePlus handset may come with a 6GB or 8GB RAM, bigger than the other two. There are also rumours that the OnePlus phone will have a 16MP selfie camera and a 23MP primary camera. It will run on Android 7.0 Nougat OS and may pack a 4,000 mAh battery. It will have USB Type-C connectivity, glass and aluminium body and 64GB internal memory, writes AndroidPit. The Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2 will also run on the Nougat OS. Both the phones may use either AMOLED or Super-AMOLED displays. The Samsung flagship will also be released with an Exynos 8895 processor, and may boast 4-6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. The Google Pixel 2 will also likely get the Snapdragon 835 boost. The Galaxy handsets will come with 5.1-inch and 6.2-inch curved displays that will also boast QHD+ resolution. The Samsung smartphones are said to be dropping the physical Home button and shifting the fingerprint scanner to the rear. They will have a higher screen-to-body ration than their predecessors. The phones may also feature 4GB RAM. The Pixel 2 handset will also likely come with 18:9 QHD+ Display. There is a possibility that Google will pack its Android 8.0 Oreo operating system in the device. Quick Charge 4.0 and SD 835 are also anticipated.

It’s been another exciting week across the tech world, with no end of exciting news keeping us on our toes. But if you’ve struggled to keep with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is here once more with a handy walkthrough of the week’s top tech news. "Laser beam" Our journey begins this week on a beam of light, as researchers at the University of Michigan revealed significant progress in development efforts for “lightwave” computers, relying on ultra-fast laser impulses to get electrons firing at incredible speeds. Their discoveries could pave the way towards creating quantum computing devices. Amazon announced that it’s bringing support for its Alexa digital assistant to iPhones – but oddly, not in the Alexa app. Instead, the functionality is being added to the Amazon app on iOS devices. On Thursday, Apple released the seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, both for developers, and testers on its Public Beta program. A passenger on a flight to Melbourne, Australia suffered injuries when her wireless headphones ‘exploded’ on board. The incident raised fresh concerns over battery-powered consumer devices on airliners, following the ban on Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 on flights last year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke with Australia's Prime Minister, offering energy storage solutions and reliable supplies to solve recent electricity shortage issues that left 40,000 people without power in South Australia. But domestic energy suppliers criticized the government for even considering Musk’s offer, calling for a “transparent bid process” and a level playing field to give Australian companies “a fair go”. Over in the UK, telecommunications giant BT agreed to spin off its Openreach network division into a separate company that will provide rivals with access to its domestic network. Rivals such as Virgin Media mocked the move, claiming that it will make little difference to BT’s competitors and to UK customers, as Openreach will continue to offer “the same old snail’s paced network with a new shell”. In Russia, Apple was found guilty of price-fixing after regulators determined that it was compelling companies to sell many of its iPhones at a minimum retail price, stifling competition in the domestic market. Several Russians were among those alleged to have been involved in major digital attacks against Yahoo, which compromised hundreds of millions of user accounts. Image: Getty Images for Visa Visa is considering launching - or at least supporting - wearable devices with support for mobile payments – but rather than going down the ‘typical’ route of wristbands, it’s instead trialling sunglasses with NFC support. On Friday, Qualcomm announced that its processors will now be known as ‘platforms’, and that it's ditching the Snapdragon branding from its current Snapdragon 200-series chips, which will now be branded under the ‘Qualcomm Mobile’ moniker. Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Intel stunned the markets by announcing its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that focuses on developing technology for autonomous vehicles. The purchase is a hugely significant move for Intel, giving it a huge boost in the technology behind self-driving cars. Intel was also a key partner in the launch of Tag Heuer’s new Connected Modular 45 smartwatch, an Android Wear 2.0 device with a diverse ecosystem of modular accessories. Promising more than a day of power, along with water resistance, the new device also comes with a hefty price tag: you’ll need to hand over $1,600 to own one. Google has developed a new system to replace the infuriating CAPTCHA tool, which features on many websites that demand that you prove that you’re “not a robot”. The "invisible reCAPTCHA" system works in the background and uses magic and witchcraft "an advanced risk analysis engine" to determine that real humans are accessing websites. Meanwhile, the latest version of Chrome’s web browser brings massive improvements in power usage for PCs, as well as introducing a new offline reading mode to iOS. Google also updated its Gmail app on Android allowing users to send and request money, just as easily as sharing an attachment. Impressively, the company says that the feature is "completely free" for both senders and recipients. Sony’s new ultra-thin Android TV, the Bravia OLED 4K HDR TV, finally got a launch date and official price tag this week – but you’ll need to be earning some serious dough to be able to afford one. Samsung also announced details of its new QLED TVs this week, featuring ‘Quantum Dot’ technology, with the 55-inch models starting at almost half the price of Sony’s 55-inch OLED TVs. Those who pre-order LG’s impressive new G6 flagship in the United States will get a free Google Home speaker hub worth $129.99 with the device. T-Mobile will be offering the new phone in the US, and announced its pricing this week. Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant – but it hasn’t been a great month for the digital assistant so far. After spewing loony conspiracy theories last week, Google Assistant unexpectedly threw in ads for Disney’s new Beauty and the Beast movie a few days ago. However, Google later insisted that the ads weren’t ads at all, but rather “timely content”. And after announcing wider availability of the Assistant on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat devices last month, Google confirmed this week that it won’t be supported on any Android tablets. Nougat is currently installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. Google is believed to be planning to release the newest version of the OS, Android 7.1.2, on April 3 – but for now, its long, slow rollout continues to more handsets: T-Mobile is now testing Nougat for the HTC One M9 OnePlus brings Android 7.1.1 to the 3 and 3T Google Nexus 6 owners on Android 7.1.1 get over-the-air ‘downgrade’ to Android 7.0, causing all sorts of issues on their devices Nougat heads to Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and S6 in India Samsung begins Android 7.0 rollout to Galaxy Note5 Earlier this month, Google released its latest monthly Android security updates. Some manufacturers have begun distributing the March patches quickly – but others have not: March security updates now available for Sony’s Xperia X, X Performance, X Compact and XZ AT&T brings February security updates to Samsung Galaxy Note5, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5 active Samsung (re)commits to monthly security updates for unlocked Galaxy smartphones in the US HMD says it will deliver monthly Android patches to the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 ZTE finally gets around to bringing January updates to its Blade V8 Pro, which was released in February The need for timely security updates was highlighted again this week with yet more Android malware having been discovered. Disturbingly, security researchers at Check Point found that malware had been pre-installed on 38 devices, including some from major manufacturers such as ZTE, Samsung, Lenovo, Xiaomi and ASUS. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be unveiled later this month, but there may not be much left for the company to announce by then. More details on the new flagships emerged this week: Images leak of Samsung Experience launcher ‘Black Pearl’ model revealed Galaxy S8 might have camera capable of capturing 1000 frames per second China expected to get exclusive S8 model with 6GB RAM Time ran out to develop the Galaxy S8’s on-screen fingerprint scanner Pricing of the new Galaxy Tab S3 was also revealed this week in the UK and US – but the new high-end tablet, which has a Snapdragon 820 chip – won’t come cheap. Also in the UK, Sony’s Xperia XZ Premium, which it unveiled at Mobile World Congress last month, has been priced at £649. After increasing the price of its Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK by 7% last week, HP is hoping to tempt people to buy the Elite x3 and Desk Dock by offering them up to £500 to trade in their existing handsets. Unfortunately, owners of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile flagships will only get £125 for their devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft cut the price of the Elite x3 and Desk Dock this week… by 2.4%. Can’t see that making a big difference in boosting sales. Sales of Windows phones have plummeted over the last two years. Industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel wrote off Microsoft’s mobile OS this week, declaring that there’s no hope for a comeback, and that we’re now living in a “two-OS world” as far as the mobile industry goes. Microsoft gave in to that reality a long time ago, bringing more of its software to rival platforms in recent years. It’s made huge improvements to its Arrow Launcher for Android devices over the last few months, adding new support for Android tablets this week. There’s now less than a month until Microsoft ends support for Windows Vista, including security updates. Microsoft has also apparently begun blocking software updates for older versions of Windows running on the newest hardware. Some Windows 7 and 8.1 updates aren’t being offered to PCs running Intel’s latest Kaby Lake (7th-generation) Core processors, along with other new-gen chips, as Microsoft is trying to force encourage users to upgrade to Windows 10. At the same time, Microsoft is now preparing to push through certain Windows 10 updates to devices over metered connections. The company says that it will only do so for “critical fixes” and other “updates required to keep Windows running smoothly”. Microsoft has begun the process of finalizing its Windows 10 Creators Update, ahead of its anticipated release in April. The next step for the company is to select a release candidate which is likely to be distributed to Windows Insiders next week. Microsoft detailed new security improvements in the Creators Update this week, but it also revealed details of features being removed from Windows 10 as part of that update. It’s been a busy week for Windows 10 development, as three new builds rolled out to the Fast ring: 15058, 15060, and on Friday, build 15061. You can find details of the fixes and known issues in build 15061 here. The latest Windows 10 SDK Preview, build 15052, is also available, along with ISOs for build 15058. The latter build is now available on the Windows Insider Slow ring too. Microsoft hasn't yet announced a firm date for the Creators Update's release, so there's plenty of room for speculation! Microsoft released its latest cumulative updates for all versions of Windows 10 on Tuesday, including build 10240.17319 (Version 1507 – the original release of the OS), 10586.839 (Version 1511 – the November Update), and 14393.953 (Version 1607 – the Anniversary Update). However, the latest update for Windows 10 Mobile devices did not include a fix for a rather unpleasant bug that leaves all users’ photos available to view without unlocking a handset. That bug was revealed over a month ago, and yet Microsoft still hasn’t resolved the issue – we checked! Microsoft did fix nine critical security issues in Windows 10 with its latest Patch Tuesday updates though. We don’t yet know exactly when Microsoft plans to announce its second-generation Surface Book, but the device is certainly ripe for replacement. It went on sale almost a year and a half ago, but there are plenty of newer and more capable alternatives available now, including some at lower prices. This week, a report claimed that the new Surface Book 2 will have a more ‘traditional’ laptop form factor, ditching the detachable display of the current model, and thus helping to reduce the cost of the entry-level model by as much as a third, bringing its price down to as little as $1,000. The thing is, that doesn’t make a great deal of sense unless Microsoft plans to differentiate the Surface Book 2 in some other remarkable new way. Surface has always been dedicated to developing new product categories to lead the way for other manufacturers to follow with their own devices. Competing head-on with existing machines by launching a ‘conventional’ notebook would go against the Surface ethos, and would likely do little to help sales of similar laptops from Microsoft’s hardware partners. Over in the UK, Microsoft is continuing to soften the blow of its recent – and massive – price increases on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 by extending its offer of free insurance and Office 365, along with new discounts on both devices. The total savings amount to as much as £600. Microsoft has been working with researchers in the UK on a remarkable project, helping visually impaired children to learn coding by using physical, tangible objects. And after several months in preview, Microsoft officially launched its Slack competitor, Teams, in 19 languages and 181 countries across the globe. Microsoft brought its OneDrive app, developed on the Universal Windows Platform, to the Xbox One this week. It also released Xbox Insider Preview build 15058 to the Alpha ring on Friday, bring a new feature along with a single fix, and a long list of known issues. It followed the release of build 15055 to the Alpha ring earlier in the week. Microsoft also revealed that its Alpha Preview of the new Xbox Game Pass will end on April 7. Game Pass is a monthly $10 subscription that will give gamers access to over 100 games, and will launch this Spring. For the first time in two weeks, Microsoft added four more titles to the list of Xbox 360 games that are backward compatible with the Xbox One. It also introduced a new in-game chat transcription feature for the Xbox One and Windows 10, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech support. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a recall of Energizer’s Xbox One 2X Smart Charger, following reports of potentially dangerous overheating on some units. And after releasing its 4.50 system software update for the PlayStation 4 family last week, some owners of Sony’s consoles have reported issues being able to connect to wireless networks. In happier news, Sony announced that it’s expanding its PlayStation Now service to include PS4 games, allowing PC gamers to enjoy those titles on their Windows machines. Nintendo brought a range of indie titles to its new Switch console, which launched earlier this month. But it also emerged that the Switch is vulnerable to a WebKit exploit, demonstrated through a proof-of-concept earlier this week.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Israeli tech firms revving up engines for self-driving cars Israeli tech firms revving up engines for self-driving cars As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. By: AP | Published:March 18, 2017 11:26 am Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. ( Source: Mobileye) As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” Also Read: Intel to buy Mobileye for about $15 Billion in car tech push She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. Founders of Mobileye present at the Prime Minister’s office at Jerusalem. (Source: AP) He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Also Read: Uber self-driving cars are coming back to California roads Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and othe sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. (Image for representation, Source: AP) “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Also Read: California says autonomous cars don’t need human drivers Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

IndiaToday.in  desk-itgd@intoday.com New Delhi, March 18, 2017 | UPDATED 12:59 IST A +A - Technology is playing a pivotal role in making the world's art and culture accessible to anyone and anywhere, said Head of Google Arts and Culture Lab Laurent Gaveau. Speaking at the opening session of Day 2 at the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, Google's Laurent Gaveau introduced audience to a variety of endeavours launched by the company to help in preservation, discovery and creation of art. Gaveau talked in detail about one of most user-friendly products from the Google stable that helps people to rediscover art--the Google Art and Culture app. The Google app, Gaveau said, gives viewer a 360-degree view of artworks, monuments. It allows people to share the pictures they love with their friends. Imagine, enjoying a top-down view of the iconic Taj Mahal which one may not get even by visiting the monument site. The Google app comes with an art recogniser feature that allows one to get interesting details about the subject just by placing one's phone in front of it--be it a monument, an artwork or even a museum. WATCH: Google's Laurent Gaveau introduces audience to Google Art and Culture app Gaveau admitted that museums were initially skeptical about giving such virtual tours to people as they felt it may prevent them from visiting the actual site. However with time, he said, museums and curators have realised that the more they share, the more people will be interested in going to these places and enjoying the arts. At the session, Gaveau and artist Dhruvi Acharya demonstrated how artists are using technology to create art. Acharya used Google's Tilt Brush to create a virtual painting. "The brush was easy to use and I can walk through my painting," Acharya said, adding that artists of her generation are using more and more technology to create different forms of art.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.     # India Today Conclave 2017# Laurent Gaveau   Suggested Stories Recommended Watch Right Now Top Takes NEWS INDIA WORLD PHOTOS CRICKET MOVIES AUTO SPORTS LIFESTYLE TECH EDUCATION BUSINESS SITEMAP Copyright © 2017 Living Media India Limited.

Share Tweet Share Tags : T-Mobile-T-Mobile+ AT&T-AT&T+ Verizon-Verizon+ Sprint-Sprint+ LG-LG+ Android-Android+ The LG G6 is hot right now, better get it at the right price With the exception of T-Mobile (which will begin March 22), all national US carriers have started their LG G6 pre-orders. On the side of retailers, only Best Buy has carrier versions of the smartphone up for pre-order (click here), but the LG G6 will be sold by LG, Amazon, and B&H as well. We'll have to whip up a separate table with the retailer offers once they are revealed. Carrier prices vary across the board, with Verizon and US Cellular seemingly presenting the most compelling offers. T-Mobile has set up a lean, no-frills offer devoid of promotions beyond the free Google Home speaker that everyone is getting. Meanwhile, AT&T and Sprint have some interesting options as well, despite being on the pricier side. Hopefully, having good credit and being a long-time (or brand new) customer will net you better offers from these two. As always, read the fine print and spend responsibly.

Thanks for checking out our new design, please let us know if you have feedback SFist is a website about San Francisco View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Autonomous Ubers Drive Under A Mile On Average Before A Human Has To Take Over by Caleb Pershan in News on Mar 17, 2017 2:15 pm Photo via Uber. Now that Uber finally got those California DMV permits it originally said it totally didn't need, it's back testing some driverless cars under DMV supervision in the state. That means we're due to hear how the cars are actually doing, as Uber will have to share info about the tests with the DMV. It's been suggested as a possible reason Uber was hesitant to seek the permits initially, perhaps because the information won't be flattering, and internal documents from Uber obtained by Recode backs up that theory. Although Uber's 43 active self-driving cars in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and California are driving more and more and therefore expected to learn and improve, they require a human driver to take over controls frequently. Looking at one week this month, the cars couldn't get more than an average of 0.8 miles before a person had to take over. A metric for that, called "miles per intervention," has declined "modestly" from last year, Recode writes. Critical interventions, in which humans must take over controls to avoid a more harmful event like running through an intersection with a red light and a pedestrian in the crosswalk, are thankfully down more sharply. Even more critical intervention at Uber seems plausible, however, as Google has filed for an injunction to take Uber's driverless cars off the road, claiming that a former Google employee who started his own company, the self-driving truck business Otto, with stolen trade secrets and intellectual property from Google. When Uber bought Otto, a months-old company at the time last summer, for roughly $700 million, it came with Otto's self-driving tech in tow. Despite a slew of scandals and PR debacles at Uber last month, Google's claims could end up being the most serious threat to the ride-hailing company's survival, or at least to their bottom line in the coming years. In February, Google/Alphabet sued over allegedly stealing tech from its self-driving car division, now called Waymo. Bloomberg has a piece pondering that lawsuit and Otto CEO, current Uber employee, and former Googler Anthony Levandowski, with lots of interesting details. Levandowski was reportedly a millionaire by the end of high school thanks to a web design firm he started at 16, and as a robotics whiz, he was an original member of Google's car team. But, writes Bloomberg, At Google, Levandowski had been both a brilliant engineer and a divisive manager, with a reputation for flouting corporate norms and skirting rules to get cars on the road as quickly as possible. He was so controversial, according to several former and current employees, that when he was being considered to lead the car team, a group of engineers revolted, causing Alphabet CEO Larry Page to rethink the choice and install a different leader, Chris Urmson. After Levandowski left Google, the software giant began an investigation of his departure, and now Google claims he used his company laptop to download 14,000 design files relating to Google's driverless car division. Levandowski has said this was in order for him to work from home. Two other Google-turned-Otto employees are also accused of stowing away with secret information. The situation may have become clearer to Google on December 13, when an email from a LiDAR supplier mistakenly Waymo/Google an email showing suspiciously similar LiDAR to the one he had developed at Google, this time with Otto's name on it. At an all-hands meeting at Uber's Pittsburgh research center, Levandowski reportedly characterized Uber's LiDAR technology as "clean." Kalanick and Levandowski are in this together: The Uber CEO sees a a kindred spirit in Levandowski, or as he put it, a "brother from another mother." Levandowski assents, saying "We think very similarly in terms of how do we get things out onto the world fastest." That might include the hierarchy/philosophy, "Safety third," which employees of Uber at Otto's SF headquarters say was on stickers in OSHA orange in a tongue-in-cheek joke. As a commenter points out, that's a common Burning Man reference/refrain and sticker. No need to worry, then.

Internet by Richard Nieva March 14, 2017 4:00 AM PDT @richardjnieva Jigsaw, one of the projects of Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt, has launched a tool to explain technical terms to you. James Martin/CNET It might sound obvious, but the thing about tech is that sometimes it can get really, well, technical. So Alphabet wants to help make nitty-gritty tech jargon simpler to explain to the masses. On Tuesday, Jigsaw, a tech incubator owned by Google's parent company, launched a website called the Sideways Dictionary that takes jargon and puts it into terms normal people would understand. Jigsaw partnered with the Washington Post to build the tool. Here's how it works. Type in a term and the site gives you analogies that would make sense to laypeople. Jigsaw For example, type in "encryption" and here's one of the analogies you'll get: "It's like sending a sealed letter instead of a postcard. To ban encryption would be like requiring all mail to be sent as postcards, including bank statements, medical letters and holiday photos. Your postman, neighbors and postal service would soon know you pretty well." A tool like this could be helpful because technology touches almost every aspect of our lives now. Every time you go on a website, you're probably encountering "cookies" that help personalize the page for you. A "DDoS attack" could bring down your favorite website for a certain amount of time. A "zero-day" exploit is a previously unknown cybersecurity vulnerability. And if powerful enough, in some cases it could wreak havoc and expose your passwords or credit card information. So yeah, it would be good if people knew what all those things mean. Jigsaw, formerly called Google Ideas, is one of the projects of Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt. It's a think tank and company that nurtures young tech startups that tackle issues ranging from online censorship to violent extremism, according to its website. The company's president is Jared Cohen, a former State Department staffer. For the Sideways Dictionary, Jigsaw even enlisted the help of Schmidt himself as well as Vint Cerf, who is considered one of the "fathers of the internet" and who now works at Google as chief internet evangelist, to write some of the analogies. Here are the ones from Schmidt: Machine Learning: It's like reading tea leaves. Because it's about recognizing patterns in data in order to predict what comes next. Except it works. Cloud Computing: It's like a library, not a book store. A simple way to access every book on the planet without having to own them all. And here are the ones from Cerf: Internet Protocol Packets: These are like postcards. They have "from" and "to" addresses and limited content. You put them into the "Internet postbox" and they magically appear at the destination. They are not reliable, however, so another protocol, called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) makes sure all the contents of the postcards get there, even duplicate postcards need to be re-sent. TCP also clears out duplicates and manages the flow of postcard traffic to avoid overloading the recipients Internet postbox. Domain Name Servers: This is like a contact list in your mobile phone. You know your correspondents by their names but the contact list has telephone numbers and postal addresses. When you want to go to a particular web site, you look up the site's name (such as www.google.com) in the Domain Name lookup service and get back from that the Internet Protocol address of the destination Web Site. Internet Protocol Address: This is a numeric address that identifies where a destination computer is attached to the Internet, similar to a postal address for a destination residence or business.

By Elisabeth Atzler and Katharina Schneider Published on 16. March 2017, 15:00 Why it matters Why it matters U.S. tech firms Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are making increasingly ambitious forays into financial services, while German banks have been slow off the mark when it comes to digitalization.

Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Google’s announcement this week that it had updated its Gmail program to let its users send and receive money didn’t get much public attention. But to people working in the financial sector, it was a bombshell. To be sure, the new service doesn’t amount to a technological innovation — established banks are working on or already offering their own phone-to-phone money transfer apps. But Google’s push into the payments market has made bankers around the world realize that the U.S. tech titans are moving into their back yard. Google launched Android Pay, a payments service for smart phones, a year-and-a-half ago, and Apple has had a similar service even longer. All four big internet companies — Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple – already offer financial services. They’re no match yet compared with the plethora of services provided by traditional banks. But the banks are getting worried, more worried in fact than about competition from the legions of financial technology start-ups. Confronted by a common enemy, fintechs and banks are increasingly starting to cooperate. In Germany, there are already 70 such alliances. Want to keep reading?

Android device updates: T-Mobile HTC 10, LG G Pad X 8.0 score Nougat Video Hands on: TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch Nougat is chugging a little more quickly down the update track. More phones are getting builds beyond the initial Android 7.0, and now Fossil’s line of watches are the first existing wristwear to get Android Wear 2.0. And then there’s the unusual saga of the Nexus 6, which is actually being downgraded back to 7.0 from 7.1.1. Read on for more. Each week, we round up all the major software updates to hit the Android ecosystem, including phones and tablets on U.S. carriers, unlocked phones, smartwatches, and Android TV devices. Make sure your device is running the latest available software so you can enjoy new features—and fewer bugs and security holes. OnePlus OnePlus 3, 3T: After a brief stint in beta, OxygenOS 4.1 is coming for this pair of OnePlus flagships. It should be available now in an over-the-air update. The company’s blog has more details about the OnePlus 3 and 3T. The official changelog follows: Upgraded Android 7.1.1 Updated Google security patch to 1st March 2017 Added expanded screenshots Improved picture taking of moving objects with blur reduction Improved video stability when recording Improved WiFi connectivity Improved bluetooth connectivity General bug fixes Android Wear Fossil: Outside of the lackluster LG Watch Style and ginormous LG Watch Sport, it’s been the waiting game for existing watches. The Q Founder, Q Marshal and Q Wander are eligible for the update. Android Wear 2.0 brings the Google Assistant, native apps, and a better Google Fit app. ZTE Axon 7: ZTE has done a nice job with software updates, as now you have Android 7.1.1 on the ZTE 7. Along with the usability improvements that come from the latest build of Android, you get Wi-Fi calling if you use T-Mobile, all the latest emojis, and the February security patch (March will have to wait, apparently). You can get all the details directly from ZTE. Google Nexus 6: It’s been a weird week for the Nexus 6. A lengthy Reddit thread appeared with users complaining about being forced to downgrade from Android 7.1.1 to 7.0. What happened was that Google initially pushed out 7.1.1 to the Nexus 6, but then pulled the update after numerous issues appeared. Now it wants everyone back on 7.0, calling it the “supported track” to try and stabilize things. It’s the first time we’ve come across Google actually rolling back a device through an update. A Googler eventually chimed in to the Reddit thread with the following statement: There was a recent OTA update for Android 7.0 that is causing confusion for some Nexus 6 users. For those of you that want to guarantee future OTA updates, you will need to get back on the 7.0 supported track. If you are experiencing issues after accepting the 7.0 update, please factory reset your device to help resolve any problems. For any Nexus 6 users that want to continue flashing/sideloading future builds, you can stay on 7.1.1 and continue to do so. Usually to downgrade you’d need to wipe your phone and start over. This isn’t the case here, but some on the thread are complaining of multiple app crashes after going down to 7.0. It sounds like a mess, so proceed with caution.

Despite the fact that Google wants you to use its browser, Microsoft the same, there's always been one elephant standing on top of your laptop if you wanted to use Google Chrome: It drains battery like no other browser. Google has apparently decided it's now time to address this, promising fixes in Chrome 57. As reported by our pals at Android Central: Google is constantly evolving Chrome to be less power hungry while also offering increased performance, and the latest development arriving in Chrome 57 focuses on power savings from further background tab management. With the latest version, tabs open but not currently in use will be more aggressively throttled to save power. Essentially Chrome 57 will limit background activity on tabs you're not currently looking at to stop the browser from gobbling up so much power. It all sounds good, and in theory should work, but we'll not sound the party alarm just yet until we've actually seen it live up to its claims. Reader comments Google Chrome will apparently stop sucking all your laptop battery 42 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating CaedenV Seriously? Is battery life such an issue anymore? After the update last fall (v54? 55?) I noticed much better battery life. Chrome already fixed most of the issue. Edge may well have better battery life, but it also does not do half of what Chrome does. Chrome is a whole OS and application platform that happens to also browse the web. If you still just browse the internet, then Edge is fine. But if you live in the world of mobile apps then there is just no replacing Chrome any time soon, and as Android apps slowly come to the platform this will only entrench Chrome usage even more. 0 3 days ago Reply DJCBS I never had battery sucking problems with Chrome on the SP3 but hey, if they're making it better, that's fine with me. At any rate I wouldn't be using inferior browsers like Edge anyway, even if Chrome drained the battery quickly. 0 4 days ago Reply thomasayri The cia has been blocked 0 4 days ago Reply SammyD97 Issa lie! 0 5 days ago Reply bogascorp The only reason I switched to chrome fulltime was because of it's cross platform availability. I have a Desktop PC, a MacBook an iPad and an Android phone. Passwords, history and so on all sync seamlessly across devices. I love Edge, it's way smoother when using animations. Everything is hardware accelerated. Just wish they released a cross platform version, even if they changed the name or added a new word to the existing name (ex: Microsoft Edge Light). I don't know. Something to make us want to use Microsoft services. 0 5 days ago Reply CaedenV Could not agree more. If Edge was everywhere and not tied to Windows then it would stand a chance. But they are developing Edge like a '90s style web browser and not realizing that Chrome and FireFox are playing a whole different game now. Even if Edge was perfect at web browsing (which it still isn't), it is not being set up to do what the other platforms do with apps, extensions, and manageability in the enterprise. If they get their act together then Edge could be a thing... they just don't seem to get it. 0 3 days ago Reply Mani Malekizadeh Edge is amazing and i have security issue on google service 0 5 days ago Reply HarnessTech As a web developer, the only thing stopping me from dropping Chrome is the poor inspector included in Edge. 0 5 days ago Reply Cartman Was using Chrome for Windows Central as it seems to hang on Edge.

Once I checked task manager and there were around 15 Chrome incidents running simultaneously. 3 5 days ago Reply Gatanui Chrome has a seperate process for each tab or two or three. This in itself does not increase power consumption, though, nor does it slow down the system. Edge also handles tabs like this, by the way. 0 5 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer Edge does the same, simply click the arrow at the side of it in task manager and notice the loads of processes it has. Chrome never slowed down my Surface Pro 2, speed wasn't the problem, in fact, without an ad blocker, Chrome is significantly faster than Edge. Edge 99% of the time just shows a stupid error that the page isn't responding whenever I disable uBlock origins, same happens here on Windows Central. The reason I didtched Chrome for good was that it's an intentionally stupidly gimped experience on my Surface Pro, similar to what this user described here ( http://sck.pm/2sX ), and fkn google doesn't seem to care to fix that, so, they can screw off with their gimped software. 0 5 days ago Reply Satish Singh Edge even works smoothly on my Windows 10 tablet with 1 GB RAM and my smartphone.

Microsoft has a long history of trying to pave their own path, frequently in a different direction than that of the market, requiring near-failure and extreme correction to recover. One example is their fall from 24% mobile marketshare, to 6.5% when they realized Windows Mobile 6.5 wasn't cutting it any more - to the fall to 1% today after launching a legitimately great Windows Phone 7 and 8 - but ONLY launching it on phones, in a market that's actively avoiding laptops and PCs for casual use... Microsoft failing to recognize that Windows (the "Stigma of Windows", actually), with all it's complexities and need for an MCSE family member of friend to keep it going, is the reason why people fear turning it on.  It's a shame because if they had launched phones AND tablets with - let's have called it Windows Mobile 7 (then 8) instead - I think today they'd be a real third player in mobile.  They'd certainly have a presence. (and come on - how many times over the years - decades - has Microsoft tried to do 'Windows on a tablet!" and failed?  Let's acknowledge the common denominator here.  Microsoft would have internally been ashamed if it launched true mobile OS tablets, and they outsold Windows, and boosted Windows Mobile phone sales.) Same goes with browsers.  Nothing - absolutely nothing - was worse than Internet Explorer 6.  If you work in IT you know what I mean - there's applications that remain that require it today, because it was so non-standard, applications coded for it became dependent on it.  And web sites coded for the larger web (adhering to web standards) broke on it.  Even out as far as IE 9, 10, and 11 (which aren't too bad at all - which) people complianed about how slow the browser was.  No one wants to launch a browser and take a coffee break before it opens.  Enter Google Chrome.  And really, much like the world was confused by Windows RT on tablets (is it mobile? full Windows?

Microsoft is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at 1) understanding the current state of the market, 2) making changes that make sense, and 3) communicating why they made radical changes.

He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! I recently read an interesting article by respected writer and analyst Walt Mossberg, who said the PC is being redefined. I agree. But ... I've described the evolving personal computing landscape in the past. To communicate an accurate picture of the modern personal computing environment and the influencing factors that have shaped it, I've acknowledged that it's impossible to ignore the impact of the iPhone. Though smartphones existed before the iPhone, those business-focused devices were not relevant to the masses. The iPhone, with its "massive" touch screen merged the iPod, a phone and an internet device, and redefined the smartphone. Consumers loved it as much as they loved the popular iPod that primed them for a pocketable consumer-focused smartphone from Apple. Eventually, the iPhone and the "there's-an-app-for-that" model, which made it a veritable "swiss-army mobile computing device," evolved into much more than the phone-iPod-internet device introduced by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs in 2007. In time, Apple's introduction of the iPhone had a profound effect on the personal computing landscape. The iPhone, Android phones and to a lesser extent Windows phones — all with their supporting app ecosystems, integrated services, always-connected nature and pocketability — supplanted the traditional PC as the most used personal computers. Yes, smartphones are personal computing devices. Microsoft, not Apple, is more instrumental to the evolution of the PC. I agree with Mossberg that the mobile computing environment and ecosystems that shape personal computing today are influencers on what the PC will ultimately be. However, I disagree with his assessment that a significant shift to the new type of ARM-based PC that runs mobile apps will be determined by Apple. Millions of consumers already buy laptops that use "mobile apps" Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Windows 10 laptops and 2-in-1s have already begun the process of bringing consumers to a laptop form factor that runs mobile apps, as well as traditional apps. This computing environment will be brought to ARM processors, as ARM-based Windows 10 PCs begin rolling out in several months. The change to an ARM-based system will be largely transparent to users. What won't be transparent are the advantages of ARM-based cellular Windows 10 PCs. Among other advantages, consumers will reap the benefits of lower costs, and lighter, fan-less and more power-efficient Windows 10 PCs. Mossberg said the following of a shift to ARM in relation to this problem: But the signs of a shift to ARM only set the stage for a bigger development: The migration of the most important modern software platforms, Android and iOS, to laptops and other traditional hardware that once defined the old kind of PC. ... I believe it won't matter much until Apple builds an ARM-based laptop running iOS. Here's why. Microsoft ... does have a modern breed of multi-touch apps that work properly on a tablet or clamshell screen, and some are included on every Windows tablet and laptop. Unfortunately, partly because Microsoft has no smartphone business to speak of, it also lacks a critical mass of these new-style apps and, even on its tablets, relies instead on classic Windows apps. Apple, by contrast, boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen. This is more than a small advantage; it's the reason people might buy this type of device instead of a traditional laptop. I agree with the general assessments Mossberg puts forth. I also see the value in his conclusion that Apple, because of its vast and appealing app ecosystem, occupies an influential position. Consumer love for iOS apps may be a sufficient motivating factor for the masses to consciously and deliberately choose to use a laptop running those same mobile apps. That's if Apple can deliver a good mouse-and-keyboard productivity experience. Can Apple generate interest in a laptop that runs only mobile apps? I put forth a similar analysis in relation to Google's position if it ever decided to merge Chrome and Android. Google's 80 percent dominance of the mobile market would be a real threat to Microsoft's 90 percent dominance in PCs if Google brought a viable desktop experience to a desktop environment. Microsoft already invented the universal app 'wheel' Apple needs iOS apps are optimized for a slate consumption-based experience, not a peripheral-enhanced productivity setting. Mossberg stated the following in relation to this problem: The definition of a PC, a personal computer, is already undergoing a profound change. A great laptop running the new kinds of user interfaces and apps that people now love on phones and tablets would be a big, exciting event that would help seal the deal. But there hasn't yet been a product that emphatically suggests the era of the traditional PC is fading. And it feels like an opportunity only Apple can seize. Microsoft's Windows 10 and Universal Platform with Continuum are driving the evolution of the PC while also keeping the traditional PC around. Rather than just a clamshell laptop that runs mobile apps, which is Mossberg's vision for an evolved PC, Microsoft's strategy is more comprehensive. Microsoft's PC vision is more comprehensive than mobile apps on a laptop. Redmond saw the coming shift and created a device form factor with the Surface, a context-sensitive OS in Windows 10 and a Universal Platform that provides a common core for all device types and app development. The research firm IDC said the following, confirming the success and adoption of Windows laptops and 2-in-1s in a recent report: Consumers are just starting to graduate from old, consumption-based, slate tablets to a more productive detachable tablet. At the same time, the benefits of having a thin, touch-sensitive, productivity-based machine is [sic] shining light on the traditional PC category, causing vendors and consumers to focus on more premium devices in the Convertible and Ultraslim space. As the tablet market works through the challenges of a maturing user base, the notebook ecosystem has seen success in assimilating a more mobile experience to the form factor while retaining its inherent superiority in the content creation arena, which remains critical for commercial buyers. Absent major external forces, IDC believes the notebook and traditional PC market overall will see relatively stable volumes with some growth in more mobile designs offset by declines in less mobile products. As we watch the unfolding of Microsoft's strategy with the industry's embrace of 2-in-1s, Windows 10 laptops and PCs and Windows Mixed Reality (formerly Windows Holographic), Microsoft's impact on the evolution of the PC, in all of its forms, obviously exceeds Apple's. Technologically, Microsoft is where Mossberg hopes Apple will get Mossberg states, "Apple … boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen." He supplies the caveat "presumably" in acknowledgment of his (and all of our) uncertainty as to the viability of iOS apps running on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard (and mouse). iOS apps are not yet optimized for a laptop environment. By contrast, we know with full certainty that Microsoft's unique UWP allows Windows Store apps to run on phones, laptops, 2-in-1s, HoloLens, Xbox, desktop PCs and any as yet to be created Windows devices. Most Windows 10 devices also run Win32 apps in conjunction with Store apps, and Windows 10 on ARM may bring that ability to phones. What Mossberg speculates would be a technological advancement for the Apple ecosystem already exists in far greater depth and breadth as part of Microsoft's UWP. Mossberg's vision of an evolved PC is a laptop with iOS apps and only iOS apps. Microsoft's personal computer vision is far broader than that. Windows 10 is key to the modern PC Though Windows 10 is only running on 400 million devices, Windows is a desktop and mobile platform. In less than two years, though far below it's one billion devices target, 400 million devices is impressive. iOS and Android have had roughly a decade to reach the billion mark those OSes achieved. Windows 10 is an evolution of the OS that embraces mobile computing. Some may argue that Windows 10 is merely an upgrade to the Windows OS that has a billion installed base. It is actually more of an evolution toward a new type of OS that retains the legacy strengths of the traditional desktop while adopting the necessary attributes of the modern, mobile personal computing environment. Universal Windows Apps, along with the coming full Windows on ARM and CShell on all types of mobile devices, help us visualize this reality. When viewing it from that proper perspective, the unique unified desktop and mobile OS that is Windows 10 has already begun to achieve in a very real way what Mossberg anticipates will be achieved with Android and iOS: bringing a relevant "mobile" OS to a desktop clamshell form factor. The market is buying, but may not "buy into" Microsoft's vision The PC's transformation, based on Windows 10 2-in-1s and even laptops, has already been accepted in the market by OEMs and consumers. Mossberg's vision awaits a move from Apple to create wide acceptance for what the success of Windows 2-in-1s is already achieving: market-wide acceptance of a laptop (or 2-in-1) OS that runs mobile apps. The Windows Store on a Windows 10 desktop has thousands of universal apps that work across various form factors, including mobile. I concede that the success of the Windows Store is not on par with Microsoft's goals. Moreover, the implementation of a Windows-based smartphone has not met commercial success. Consequently, though there are thousands of universal apps that are compatible beyond the mobility of a laptop or 2-in-1 form factor, and that work on a phone, the number is dwarfed by the number of iOS apps in the App Store. So yes, the popularity of iOS apps, if somehow made to work as efficiently in a mouse-and-keyboard laptop form factor, would produce more of a "conscious" decision by consumers to seek out or inquire about such a device. These consumers may be motivated by a desire to use the mobile apps they're familiar with from their iPhones, on a laptop-like device. PC consumers are likely not motivated by an opportunity to experience Store apps. By contrast, the universal apps that are part of Microsoft's proliferating "evolving PC" vision and that are also available to users who buy Windows 10 2-in-1s and laptops are in many cases likely just "along for the ride." Candidly speaking, these user purchases are likely less motivated by the opportunity to experience universal apps and their benefits than by the productivity legacy of Window PCs, even as manifest in modern touch-enabled laptops and 2-in-1s. The Windows Store's underperformance is likely one of the motivating factors in Microsoft's increasingly aggressive advertising efforts in Windows 10. It needs to get users that have embraced the new OS and evolving PC form-factors to also embrace the ecosystem that they exist within. Apple, with the popularity of iOS apps, but the lack of a truly universal platform akin to the UWP, and the efficient productivity environment that Windows 10 PCs bring mobile apps, would have the exact opposite challenge. Microsoft's impact on PC evolution is both deep and broad Ultimately, I agree with Mossberg's conclusion from a consumer perspective. That is, if Microsoft cannot draw developers and consumers to its modern app ecosystem, Apple may be more successful in drawing consumer "attention" to the concept of a mobile-app-focused laptop. That's if Apple invests in and successfully creates an iOS-based laptop, which the famously secretive company has made no indication of doing. I do, however, believe that Mossberg may be underestimating the industry impact Microsoft's Windows 10 and UWP has had, and is currently having, on the evolution of the PC, in the form of touch-sensitive laptops, 2-in-1s and other devices like HoloLens that run universal apps. Mossberg may be underestimating Microsoft's impact on the PC's evolution. OEM's, consumers, businesses, and various industries have greatly embraced these "modern," evolved PCs. As Microsoft's partners begin bringing ARM-based cellular PCs to market in several months, that impact will be even more evident than it is now. In truth, Apple's mimicry of the Surface with the iPad Pro is indicative of its reactive, or follower's role, in the PC's evolution. The evolution is well underway. Microsoft is driving it, and its plan goes even further than Mossberg's vision of mobile apps on a laptop form factor.

If you failed to read it, you will find it under the subtitle, "The market is buying, but may not "buy into" Microsoft's vision. Also the piece isn't "about" the UWP, but about Microsoft's impact on the redefinition of the PC. As such the rebuttal to Mossberg's article (this piece) necessitated the addressing of the UWP as part of the narrative. To intentionally exclude that would have painted an incomplete picture.

I'm oldschool enough to remember that once, Bill Gates thought that the future for MS was entertainment content! I also agree that MS will define the future of PC computing for some time to come. Apple, by contrast, went the route of non-stop upgrades and rollouts for the generations they assume will always have no issue paying $500 plus for a fancy communications device, every year. Their hardware vision is pure marketing. Meanwhile, as fun as it is, the world has changed, security wise, and now not even Apple owners are safe from hackers and virus infections. In addition, inb my mind, the continuing safe state of Cloud Computing remains viable as long as the servers can keep moving constantly to avoid detection. I still prefer to store my own data on a local drive. I can secure it myself, and shut it down overnight, etc. But then, I come out of a DIY culture and distrust anything I can't take-apart, fix and reassemble. I've built our home and business systems since the i286, and appreciate the more affordable, egalitarian approach to operating systems and hardware design that MS has given the PC World. MS has had several misfires, like most companies, but they manage to rise again, as have some of the underdog hardware manufacturers like AMD (my own preferred processor, BTW...). I think Windows will be running on all kinds of machines for a long time to come. 0 4 days ago Reply VITNE Maybe Microsoft needs to stop calling them apps and go back to calling them programs. Before iPhone, I never heard anyone say "I just got this new computer app." It was always the word "program." It may seem silly, but "app" sounds mobile and weak and "program" sounds powerful. Maybe call the Windows Store the "Windows Software Store" "app" became the buzzword after iPhone took off. Now everyone associates apps with mobile. Seeing as how MS is marrying the mobile side and desktop side with things like Continuum, maybe they need to think about word associations and the mentality behind them. Maybe just switching to the terms "software" and "program" will put the power of Windows back in people's minds, regardless of form factor. 2 4 days ago Reply ED the new guy The genie is out of the bottle. People have tasted a world not dominated by Microsoft and it's working for them. Microsoft missed the boat when they failed to challenge Chrome on the desktop and iOS and then Android in the mobile device sphere. These two operating systems have wrested a whole generation away from Microsoft's sphere of influence. Chrome's success with HTML 5 on the desktop has allowed a whole generation to become platform agnostic. And, it's also taken a substantial chunk out of previous generations. Web services are where the <30 crowd is at, and, the operating system that gives access to those services is irrelevant. You can just as easily run Chrome on a stripped down single purpose Linux OS as you can on a full blown Windows OS and still get 100% of the experience. You can easily switch between Mac OS X, Windows, Android and iOS because the experience is mediated by HTML 5! PS App is the new program. I now on the verge of needing bifocals and I have a hard time keeping app and program straight. People who aren't techies don't know the difference. To them an app is a program. Besides, app is a good short form for application. To me application is program that the user uses to perform tasks. A program is simply a piece of compiled code. It could be part of the OS or part of an application but does not in and of itself directly useful to the user. 0 4 days ago Reply md2boys This is all great, but lets get on with it.  I have been waiting for a new Microsoft Mobile device for some time now.  The HP is nice, but I'd like ot see the new Surface mobile I keep reading about.  What's taking so long, my Nokia 1520 is getting old and needs to be replaced!!! 0 4 days ago Reply Tom French2 With 10 still in a flux state improving with every update it is only a matter of time before the store apps will improve.  Right now the consumer drives the iOS and Android platforms in the mobile environment but when mobile in Windows is fully implemented then it may not completely catch up but I believe will gain some ground on the others.  They too are now being forced to rethink what they are doing because of Microsoft and Windows 10.  While what they have is nice to use I still don't like the appearance of their start screens or the lack of flexibility they do not have that Windows does in mobile.  If Satya had been in charge of Microsoft 2 years earlier we would be talking a much different mobile platform already.  The mobile platform would be a much larger share of the market than it is now.  0 4 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat "A matter of time"...yes.

I'm sorry, but for many of us 30+ year veterans (how's that for getting around the old folks label) Mr. Mossberg will forever be the Apple acolyte that Steve jobs would tell things to that he wouldn't even trust with his own family. Everything appears through an Apple lens for him. I'm not saying he is necessarily wrong, as he is on to something with the transition to touch screen mobile devices, but like the current Apple leader, can't get past the toaster+refrigerator metaphor.  0 4 days ago Reply Viktar H This won't work. Microsoft and Nadella are not interested in Windows 10 and UWP. No resources are being invested here. And effectively nobody uses UWP apps on desktops and laptops (they are primitive and extremely buggy). See EDGE market share as an example. And Microsof is zero in IOT And in cars. And in mobile space. And even Cortana is outdated and sees no development efforts behind it for years. There IS a potential, but MS will leave consumer space for Google and Apple and will move to the server side of things. 0 4 days ago Reply ar-7 I think it will be interesting to see what Microsoft, Apple, and Google does over the next few years. Each have their own challenges when it comes to redefining the modern PC. For Microsoft it's the legacy of the PC. Not just with developers ignoring the UWP but having to cater Windows to legacy desktop users. Apple's challenge is the money. They make money from selling hardware. Tim Cook keeps his job by increasing shareholder value. They have a strong interest in keeping the iPad as a third device and not trully challenging the Mac. It's why they emphasized hardware accessories with the iPad Pro and not so much the software. Google lacks the focus to lead this, imo. They have done little, imo, to make Android or apps tablet friendly. I really like the Chromebook concept but I don't think they will push that enough to really compete with what Microsoft is doing. 0 4 days ago Reply Sparkxster Google is already doing this with Chromebooks bringing chrome os and Android together.

Glad to see ms filling their shoes. 1 5 days ago Reply Awhispersecho 1st of all, why does everyone act like Apple is dominating every market? Whether it's TV, tech sites, or companies who make money evaluating the tech industry, they all act like Apple is dominating everything. This is a company that has 14% mobile marketshare and 4% PC marketshare. Just because they are worth a fortune due to using older, lesser technology while charging more for it, doesn't mean they are dominating. It just means they are making their investors happy. Secondly, Apple was never innovative and neither was Steve Jobs. They have never invented anything, they never created a "new" product. They have always taken an existing product and made it look better and usually work better. That's great but it doesn't make you innovative. And Steve Jobs wasn't anything he has been made out to be. He was an ass, a selfish jerk. He was a guy who screwed over old partners, who refused to acknowledge his own daughter was his for years. He was a guy didn't want apps on the iPhone and almost shut down the whole iPad project because ge didn't like the tone of white they were using. He was the guy who said good companies copy, great companies steal and are proud of it. Having said all that, I have zero faith in MS to do anything right at this point. Even if they do things right, they will be 2 years too late and then they will have to start over again. They have painted themselves into a corner that they will not be able to get out of. Dropping Mobile was a huge mistake. They won't survive another 10 years in the consumer space. They will be enterprise only within 5 years except for Xbox which will be sold off. They can thank a combination of incompetence and Nadella for that. It's painful to say because I love the Surface line, I love my Windows PC's and phones, I'm a huge Xbox fan, but this company is clueless, directionless and has screwed over fans so much that there is no turning back now. They will fall hard and fast in the consumer space. Cloud and Enterprise is all they will have left. It won't be Apple. It would be MS if it weren't for MS. That leaves Google. Unfortunately Google will eventually dominate this space as well. 1 5 days ago Reply Ameet Narayan I just hope Apple doesn't steal Microsoft's thunder and release Mac OS for ARM, Apple would have reinvented the wheel and it will be the next best thing since sliced bread.

"PC makers and consumers have embraced Microsoft's PC vision." Have they?  Have they really?  They're only buying what's available.  Referencing a quote a record industry zealot once made to me when questioned about producers and artists' inability to record without incurring costs due to the record label pyramid beholden to the legal ASCAP/SESAC/BMI cartel that keeps him fat and warm - he said "Don't conflate spending with free will.  You're eventually only going to have two terrible choices that will cost you more than you can afford but can't bring effect to the world without it."  He made this comment with regard to the costs producers and artists have to incur due to the cartel instead of just playing music on the sidewalk because they love the art so much no matter where they can express themselves.  What does that have to do with Microsoft's vision?  If people want or need to use a computer, do PC makers and consumers really have a realistic option to not use Microsoft-based hardware other than using the very fragmented GNU/Linux universe on the "modern" PC or (for users) without going broke in buying Apple's underperforming, overpriced junk that Microsoft is basically endorsing by overpricing its underperforming, overpriced junk (this one's for you, Surface Book and Studio)?  The only "modern" PC options people have are within the context of a virtual duopoly with little to no competition (except a trace from Linux) in meeting "modern" PC users where they are. "Among other advantages, consumers will reap the benefits of lower costs, and lighter, fan-less and more power-efficient Windows 10 PCs." There is no evidence whatsoever in the recent history of computing of ARM leading to any of what you are claiming "will" happen.  The prices of ARM-based devices are ever increasing without merit.  Most willing buyers are young and few of them have their own PC because they don't want PCs.  They'd only be potential upgraders to still-inadequate-for-actual-computing ARM-based Windows 10 cellular devices, which will only cost more than what those young users currently have that already do more than enough. 2 5 days ago Reply tomworthjr Microsoft is 95% there with the Surface Book's trackpad and keyboard (actually, 99% there on the keyboard and 90% on the trackpad).  Those are the inputs that the iPad pro doesn't have, but the MacBooks do - or did, until the newest gen of MacBook Pro and the MacBook 12 inch.  Those took a step back.  If Microsoft can go for the win on the keyboard and trackpad, they will win a lot more converts.  Cortana already runs circles around Siri (and although Google Assistant beats Cortana, Google is not in this laptop/laptop replacement contest). Why do I focus on laptop replacement, rather than "smartphones?"  Because the future is computing devices, not phones.  And computing devices need software, which is why iOS and Android are winning.  If Microsoft can build the best computing devices (they are THIS close to doing so), the developers will follow.  In other words, the best software requires people to build it, and those people prefer to work on the best hardware.  Apple has squandered its multiyear lead on hardware superiority, Google isn't in that game, so it is Microsoft's for the taking. 2 5 days ago Reply kansokusha Microsoft will do all the innovation, and they'll screw themselves and their customers with horrible implementation and abysmal product support.

So very Americentric. -1 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I think I agree with your assertion about Microsoft driving the evolution of the PC. It is a fact that Apple (and later Google with Android) broadened the scope, experience and market for personal computing. For some reason, I keep feeling like Microsoft's adherence to a Enterprise-first consumer base keeps limiting them from developing truly consumer-wowing (and consistent) user experiences: E.g. 1: Teams is an awesome product but they lock it within the enterprise (i.e. O365) ensuring that few outside of the 85 million (?) O365 users would ever go for it (so Slack slurps the "outcasts" up), making Teams seems more like a defensive move against Slack encroaching on existing (and future?) O365 users rather than a superior take. If it were a free/low-cost non-O365 (at first) tool, Teams could probably be used to draw people into the main ecosystem (see all the cool things you can get it to do with O365). E.g. 2: Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). Legacy (business) makes them shoehorn different UI paradigms together, limiting the power of the Live Tile to evolve and show its superiority to other UI/UX paradigms). It's not whoever has the best designed product or innovation, it's whoever sells and blasts the goodness and uniqueness of their product early enough (and says they did it first and best) that gets noticed. Microsoft must point out the new innovations they bring to the market first. Not just to tech press but the general public. Look at the new HP ads with Christian Slater! Look at the responses. Relevant and good publicity (and that's just for printers). Microsoft will always attract only the work-related perception from consumers and the tech press as long as it always sells itself only on "productivity" (=business). That is why I like the focus on "Creativity" (a la Creative Update, etc.). I think it should be more than a one-off update name but rather a modern ethos (a sort of Productivity 2.0?) for Microsoft. The Creative Lifestyle. Maybe two marketing identities for business (productive) and consumers (creative)? 0 5 days ago Reply Asc aris Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). So Windows 10 needs a UI refresh to be good for desktop, and is not well suited to mobile either in its current form.  If that is what you're saying, I agree completely.  What it looks like is that MS has designed "one UI to rule them all" that is equally mediocre on both of the platforms it's supposed to cover.  It seems that a lot of the excitement over this isn't about the product as delivered, but is instead about the promise of what it might deliver in the future once the rough spots are smoothed out.  Unfortunately, though, I think that the rough spots are not merely a function of as-yet incomplete development so much as a structural issue that has to do with the very nature of generalization vs. specialization.  The better MS makes Windows 10 for tablets (and phones even more so), the worse it ends up being for the desktop.  They can move that slider to an infinite number of positions along the "continuum"  between mobile and desktop platforms, but favoring one will always mean hampering the other, and that's not just an issue of polish or fine-tuning.   Ultimately, it all boils down to yet another proof of the "Jack of all trades, master of none" trope.  Mobile devices and traditional PCs have differing needs, and when you try to write one UI that covers both, it's just not going to work as well on either of them as a dedicated UI for that platform-- and since we do have examples of that on desktops (Windows 7, MacOS) and mobiles (Android, iOS), the bar is going to be set as high as the perceived quality and fitness of each dedicated UI.  Windows 10 falls far short of what desktop users have had for many years in terms of a polished, consistent, and visually coherent UI.  It still feels confused about whether it wants to be a phone or a PC. If MS insists on going down this road, the only way I can really see it working is to have two complete UIs within Windows, and to select the one that is most appropriate according to circumstance and user preferences.  Desktop PCs and traditional laptops would have the desktop UI, same as Windows always has, while mobiles would get the UWP UI.  Each UI would be feature-complete by itself and optimized for its platform, so there would never be any need to muddle through on a bit of the OS that was designed for a platform other than the one then in use.  Convertible/2 in 1 devices could default to the desktop UI when in laptop mode, and to the UWP UI when the keyboard/base is removed.  The user, ideally, would be able to change these settings to suit his needs better, since one size rarely (if ever) fits all. When you look at it in those terms, it doesn't seem all that innovative anymore (to me at least).  Including two complete UIs for two separate platforms, running on two different sets of binaries (x86 and ARM, of course) that happen to have been compiled from similar/the same source code sounds a lot like writing two distinct (though closely related) operating systems for two distinct platforms, then slapping the same name on each and caling it one product.  It may not be as "gee whiz" cool in its implementation, but it would allow a no-compromise UI for each platform, and I don't think users will (or should have to) accept anything less than that.   0 2 days ago Reply Bai So we go a full cycle and back to RT?  C-shell seriously don't matter to most.  Cellar PC, a fancy name of smartphone.  When was the last time you use a use a x86 program for personal use?  Me photo editing is the only x86 I still use, and that I don't want/care about ARM and battery life because no battery will last a few hundred RAW convertion.  I either have it plug in all the way or do it on my PC.  For office use, why do I want a ARM laptop 2-1 or whatever when I can have my x86 CRM on a regular laptop?  Or I can remote it from any Android/IOS/WP/PC.  Wake me up when adobe/sales force/auto cad...etc make a ARM UWP.  For productivity cloud is the future and cloud don't care what the front end is, it could be ios/android/wp it don't matter.  There are companies that send cad project to hosting company to render and cut the time in 1/2.  There are online RAW converter alreadyInot a very good one).  Continuum make a alot of sense, and I don't need a full feature win10 fo it. 0 5 days ago Reply LIEBER I'm interested in the possibility of running Windows 10 Pro on ARM processors. Will it be possible to run *all* Win32 bit applications on ARM 835 processor, in emulation mode? How does this relate to HP Elite X3 and the possibility to run ordinary applications on a HP server? An alternative approach... is to use an "old fashioned" solution. 30 years ago, it was possible to run X Windows terminals and remotely log in via a network. A modern solution could be: * MS includes a Windows terminal program (similar to Teamviewer, etc.) as part of Windows 10 * It should be possible to remotely log into another Windows machine via internet or via 4G/5G phone networks; it must be possible to reach through routers, firewalls, etc. * Assuming I have a desktop computer, job work station, home media computer, etc., and that I have all the 32 bit or 64 bit applications I need on these, it should be possible to log in from ARM based (and intel based) smartphones, tablets, laptops, or in principle any type of computer ("terminal machine"), and run the programs on my desktop, workstation, media computer, etc. ("server machine") -- remotely * The "terminal window" should mirror the desktop on the "server" computer. * If I have two screens on my "terminal" PC, it should be possible to run the terminal window on one screen, and run other programs on any screen. * It should be possible to cut and paste between the "terminal" PC and the terminal window of the "server". * If both "terminal" PC and the "server" PC sync files via OneDrive (or DropBox, or whatever), this gives transparent exchange of files. But copy and pasting may still be useful. OK... personally, I'm a little skeptical about completely depending on running programs on a remote computer -- what if internet is down (or the connection is slow), or what if there are expensive roaming fees on 4G/5G? So I certainly see the usefulness of running 32 bit (and if possible, 64 bit) applications on the smartphone/tablet/etc. (ARM processor, etc.), but a modern "terminal" program will make it possible to, in practice, run 32 bit and 64 bit programs on relatively light weight ARM processor based units. The main problem with this approach is with small screen devices such as smartphones: I'm not sure the user experience will be good with running *applications* on a small screen -- maybe a foldable screen device may make it possible to fold out a decent screen? UWP apps is something else -- they are designed to adapt to various screen sizes. 0 5 days ago Reply L0n3N1nja IPad apps as they currently are on a laptop? I don't see that ever going anywhere.

In the public mindspace, Windows is still a desktop OS - when they want a mobile it's Android or iOS. Part of this is Microsoft's failed "Continuum" strategy in their UI - it's still the exact same UI not matter what device you're on. This is a problem because ​people don't want a desktop/start menu on their mobile device​. This is something Microsoft hasn't learned since the days of Windows CE. Windows 8 was a good start, but failed because the "Desktop Mode" should have been more Windows 10 and Windows 10 fails the tablet/moble users because it needs to be more Windows 8. The idea is a great one, they NEED to figure out that "Desktop UI" is NOT the same as "Tablet UI" is not the same as "Phone UI" (though Tablet UI and Phone UI should be much closer to each other than Desktop UI). In the end, Apple's strategy is correct for the here and now, but Microsoft's strategy will ultimatly be correct (if it grows up signifigantly in the next couple years). 1 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I give it one year of rapid maturing.

Which of those two companies has behaved more like that in the past three years? This doesn't mean Microsoft will triumph over Apple (I've never bought into the fanboy view that for Apple to win, Microsoft must lose or vice versa.) because failure to spot the next disruption or a new opportunity can happen to any company, and it has happened to Microsoft before. Devices are getting more powerful and more linked with one another through the cloud and common software.

Love or hate Apple, you need to thank them what they did in the market. They opened it up to more of a smart device from what were using. If you wanted a SMART device, you  had a Windows Mobile/PocketPC (a pocket Windows version with the bugs) or Blackberry. Apple came with a store, and the format Microsoft has always dreamed of.  Maybe Microsoft would of came up with it but, they were 5 years too late and by then, they lost. I can go deeper into this but, Microsoft is not doing anything besides making Windows compatable with current SMALLER devices. Nothing new, just a smaller package.   -6 5 days ago Reply HenriqueNL This is all very nice and I agree with most of the article, but if Microsoft doesn't advertise what the Windows 10 vision is and how it works on several form factors, people will never realize all the positives laid out in this article. That is why time and time again, Apple or Google (through Samsung in the majority of cases) will always be heralded as the companies that "invented" features Microsoft already had before. When was the last time you saw a Microsoft ad showcasing Windows 10? I'm not talking about PC/Surface ads, but what Microsoft is doing with and for Windows 10. A 30 second ad of Windows on different form factors (including phone) would start to make people look and think more closely to Microsoft and maybe call out certain tech sites when they start babbling about how great feature x or y is on iOS or Android. The rare Microsoft ads I see in the UK on television are for the Cloud. I know professionals also watch TV but it doesn't showcase anything "useful" for the regular Joe. And it's not like Microsoft doesn't have some good hardware/form factors to show off: Xbox One, HoloLens, Elite X3, Surface Pro/Book. If people knew all of the above run Windows 10 (and not necessarily version x86/64, Mobile, etc) then maybe people (consumers and developers) can see one of the advantages of UWP and build/port more apps and services over. All of this of course won't mean anything if Microsoft doesn't push harder to improve the OS as a whole, instead of spending resources in helping out other platforms with apps containing more features. 6 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi You said it all! 1 5 days ago Reply sdreamer Totally agree MS is pushing the tech arena lately, but is getting almost 0 credit. We can see how Apple and Google reacted to the Surface Pro line with their own Pro lines. You can also see some new AR headsets that seem to suddenly pop after the hololens was released. MS is really pushing hard for new things, but the market just doesn't see them anymore sadly. Then their lack of consistent support, and quality of support in some cases  really does not help. Apple really has a solid foundation right now, and many draw comparison to MS back then, but the key difference is users like Apple vs back then it was the cool thing to poke at MS. Apple too is too big to fail, but even if they start to, they are so well liked that it's almost impossible to really topple; maybe stumble, but not fall face first. I just wish MS was consistent, delivered the hardward they envisioned. I'd still be on a WP if they probably had the hardware, but they don't right now, and the company that offers the most consistent experience for productivity for me right now is Apple, and I've slowly transitioned to them but still using MS services as a backbone, and that works just great. 2 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I agree that MS has not always executed well enough the first time out, even when they had the lead.

But if you're referring to me thinking of something other than a Pro 4 for my use, I assure you, I will never own an Apple product.  I'd strap a feature phone to an old Zune before I bought an iPhone.  I'd strap a raspberry pi and a UPS to the back of an old monitor before I bought an iPad.  I may be frustrated and venting about Microsoft (yay downvotes!), with some valid points (my opinion, for what little it's worth), but I LOATHE Apple products.  I told my wife that if she gets an iPhone, don't bother coming home.  Well, she can come home, but I told her she's on her own for at-home tech support, because I won't touch it. 3 5 days ago Reply Mister Burns lol!

You make an interesting point in your analysis about mobile cellular pcs killing future businesses. But i think this pertains to "smartphone (as we know it today)" businesses. Even you started from the idea of Android phone than expanding to chromebook or Android tablet. What the world will learn is that this progression isn't a necessity to mobile computing. Microsoft knows they lost the smartphone battle so I believe that's the point. They know computing needs to be mobile so instead of a smartphone mobile take, they are taking a 'p.c.' mobile take. The industry killed their smartphone business already so they don't have any future smartphone business of their own to kill; only the competition's. To conclude, I believe you're correct and THAT'S the point of the endeavors being made now. You may want to wait a bit to see if a surface pro 5 is on the horizon depending on your budget.

The need for a the desktop productivity environment has not been eliminated, however. The move of the mobile landscape to the desktop environment is what we are seeing happenng. It is also what Mossberg has argued will be a massive shift as ARM processors come on laptop form factors and IF iOS also comes to that form factor. He argues that Apple will have the greatest impact in refining the PC. I argue that Microsoft, with Windows 10, the UWP and Continuum has already done, and is driving that evolution. PC makers and consumers have embraced Microsoft's PC vision. Apple is following. It is true however that most PC users are not using the Store apps, which if they are full UWP apps, are by nature also mobile apps.

Microsoft's attempts are most of the time half-hearted and incomplete. Take WP for example. How long did we scream about updates for simple things the competition had for years? It wasn't too hard to create a decent music player on WP8.1. Now look at the Windows 10 built-in Store apps. Almost all of them seem incomplete, lacking clear design guidelines and crashing as if interns are responsible for creating the most important part of Microsoft's future. For all their "expertise" in creating software, Microsoft lacks skill in creating almost any form of software related to mobile - Windows 10 Mobile being the prime example. (I don't believe it deseves to be WP 8.1's successor in any way). The Tablet Mode on Windows 10 SUCKS. Watching a video in Tablet Mode, double click on the video and watch is the window visibly resizes to smaller size and then goes back o full screen, indicaing sloppy coding. Closeing some Win32 windows in tablet mode results in a blank screen where you can't do anything, instead of going back to the Start screen. The whole thing is incomplete, and second grade software like this will NOT challenge Apple in the long run. When Microsoft themselves decided the Windws Explorer in full screen is good enough to take care of file management even in Tablet Mode, why would anyone decide to create UWP apps for tablets and limit themselves framework-wise when they can create Win32 and target all Windows versions?

And when it is published and don't be a hit (maybe because it not really finished), then the developer looses intrest in it. Not all can afford to quit they job to work fulltime on an app. For most of us it a parttime thing. One thing I really miss when working with XAML is the ability to use % just as we do in HTML.

I did look at alternatives for things like mocking for unit tests, but they were either rather expensive commercial products, or, in the case of the mocking frameworks, the free components that were able to get around the "reflection emit" issue were, for me, simply inadequate. While some breaking changes are to be expected in making a change like migrating from "classic" .Net to UWP, if Microsoft really want all Windows developers to embrace the "new way of doing things" then expecting them to throw away significant portions of their existing core code because it was designed to work with components that don't (or can't) support UWP is going to deincentivise the case for bothering with a UWP version.  Though many of these components aren't under the direct control of Microsoft, and who knows why many of them haven't been upgraded to .Net Standard, for example, it wouldn't hurt for Microsoft to "encourage" them to be upgraded to help boost the case for UWP app development.  Besides, at a personal level, I don't really care if Microsoft or someone else made a particular component I use in my applications: if I can't get it to work in a UWP application then I'm more likely to conclude that UWP is way too much hassle and I'd be better off sticking to "classic" .Net (and yes, I am aware of the Centennial app bridge). 1 5 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat But honestly, what is the point of developing UWP instead of, say, WPF with "classic" .NET? We hear a lot of "it runs on phones, XBOX, HoloLens" etc. but Windows phones are nowhere to be found, XBOX is a gaming console and HoloLens is simply vaporware. You'd trade a rich set of tried and true APIs and Frameworks for...what exactly? BTW HoloLens reminds me of the original "Surface table" that excited lots of people (myself included) just to go into oblivion. Microsoft has a "vision" always in words. If you've seen any push in the direction of this vision, show me. All I've seen so far is trading of truely powerful sofware for their weak counterparts - like Windows Media Player with the "mobile" Groove Music and WP8 with W10M. By the time HoloLens gets up and running (if it ever does) the competition is very likely to get there with something of their own, and they are in the right place too: imagine an Android augmented reality headset that runs apps just like HoloLens does;  Augmented reality isn't really for content creation but mostly entertainment and collaboration and these categories are a good fit for mobile apps instead of something like Photoshop. So Google and Apple can pretty easiy release HoloLens-esque headsets and jump in the game. I'm sorry.

Sales are poor and Windows is shrinking. -2 4 days ago Reply Mister Burns just quit. not because I agree with him but for your own sanity. 0 4 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat We are talking about "living off your legacy". For the past 10 years Apple has been practically living off of the original iPhone. You either disrupt markets or transform them. Microsoft is doing the second one because that's where they are big. Now phones is where Apple is big, but you see no transformation happening and that's the point. Apple is now where Microsoft has been for years, and that's the thing we were talking about. Regarding your analogy of Surface to "laptop with a stolen touch from Apple": Apple was not the first one to use capacitive touch, so basicaly "iPhone was a phone that stole a touchscreen from LG" if we want to argue like you do. If I want to argue the other way around: the iPhone was just an iPod with technology "stolen" from the likes of Nokia to make it a phone. So this line of reasoning is invalid and Surface IS redefining the PC with sales of laptops dropping and hybrids gaining ground. Again, it was about living off a legacy. Microsoft's legacy is Windows. Surface is new adventure for them. Apple's legacy, as of now, is the iPhone. They have no new adventure and are living off of the iPhone sales. 1 4 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi And made a lot of sacrifices for the long play. 2 5 days ago Reply abel46 "Microsoft went through some substantial growing pains to get where it is." That is certainliy true. Let's hope they can harvest the fruits of it in the time to come.   0 4 days ago Reply pallentx I agree that MS has done everything right and built the superior option. My fear, however, is that developers will continue to ignore it, coding for PCs as they always have and for mobile as they currently do - until Apple does it, then they will flock to Apple's verions in droves. 2 5 days ago Reply bebochek This will all change soon. A phone will be a computer and a computer will be a phone and apps will because obsolete. People cry about bank apps but the banks have a mobile version. Most every site has a mobile version now. I don't use Facebook but my wife does and she just pinned the site to her start screen, why have an app sucking up space? Pretty soon you can just go to Facebook and do most anything, pay for things, send your friends money, book a flight, rent a car. Soon in the Microsoft Store you will be able to change your cell provider and manage you account. Cortana will take care of almost everything you need. Soon we may not need a phone at all. You will wear a thing on your wrist and a plug in your ear and a pair or glasses to let you see. I'm old enough to think that a smart phone is straight up Star Trek ****. We really don't know what will come out and change our lives next year. It seems Apple doesn't anymore either but Microsoft is trying at least. 1 5 days ago Reply paulxxwall Doesn't hurt to dream now does it... 1 5 days ago Reply Francisco_dAn I love the idea of a phone becoming a powerful extension of a PC but when I'm working on a PC, I want the big fat luxury of a PC.

Even just scaling from a phone's 4.5" screen to a 10" tablet looked awful. They dumped that line a month after launch. Without the secret-foo powers of Continuum, a phone app on a laptop or a 20+ inch desktop will look ridiculous and be a waste. It takes more than a common kernel to make an app scale. The UX has to adapt to the new medium as well.

It was a great read from start to finish. I'm confident in MS's ability to lead amd bring the evolution of the PC.

Posted from an Android S7 because I dropped my 950XL and could not replace it... 1 4 days ago Reply Tommy Sebestyen My only problem with the UWP apps is that most of the ones that are meaningful to most general users (i.e. Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Instagram) are either clunky and not coded well, not maintained, missing from the Store entirely, or lacking basic functionality that the iOS, Android, or web apps have.  This is the biggest reason why people don't use UWP apps.  If the apps on the Store that mattered were made well, then maybe more people would use them.  The potential is massive, but devs don't use it. 0 4 days ago Reply Tommy Sebestyen For example, I usually keep the Facebook Messenger website open.  For about a week I tried to use the Messenger UWP app.  It disconnected my Bluetooth, took 5 minutes to load after being minimized, and lacked a button for entering normal emojis, forcing me to open the Windows touch keyboard to enter emojis.  It also doesn't have a reply box in the notification, which is obviously possible *cough* Skype Preview *cough* and (I think) is there in Android 7.0.  It isn't optimized for a large display at all, either.  Comparing the website with the app, I found I'd rather have to refresh the website if I lose my Internet connection than wait 5 minutes for an app to load my messages. 0 4 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Search Console appears as one of the data sources in the data sources selector. Search Console was once Webmaster tools, a diagnostic web platform for monitoring website performance. But since masking its search data for users logged into a Google tool (like Gmail or Google Plus), Google has evolved Webmaster Tools to better report how well a site attracts search queries. Hence, Search Console was born. The significance of this represents a growing trend in search to combine search data with other data. That combination is part of a larger shift now happening with analytic tactics, and with the needs managers are looking to fill.  When I started out in analytics eight years ago, search was the primary query mechanism for people.   Today people use search and social media to discover products and services. That means additional search data is being generated via video, images, and posts, all in an unstructured way. Tools like Data Studio can blend traditional search data and social media sources, so that they can exist in a way amenable for data mining. One of the long-standing tenets of search is that users typed keywords into search engine, making the volume of search an analytics objective.  The rise of voice-enabled queries from mobile phones has shifted emphasis to phrases rather than loose keyword association.   The rise of AI-enhanced voice assistance devices, such as Google Assistant and Amazon Echo, emphasizes phrases further. Consumers interact with IoT devices, generating richer detail around query phrases. The end result is that more context is associated to a query. All of this means marketers must be smarter about what kinds of queries should be analyzed, and must broadly consider where those queries occur.  In short, it means combining data and modeling where possible. Creating a link between Data Studio and Search Console requires setting up a Search Console account first.  You do so as you would for any Google service – sign up at Search Console site, and the add a property, which can be the URL of a website or Android app. You should also verify the added account, by either uploading a HTML file or adding a HTML tag.    You can then associate your Search Console account with your Data Studio. Click on the data sources selection on the menu on the left, then click the add button on the lower right.  Once added, you should see a row label indicating your property and ownership; The following image shows the Zimana Search Console being linked to a Data Studio account. Data Studio imports the site impression and URL impression metrics from the search analytics report in Search Console.  This means you are not gaining any new metrics. The main advantage users get with Data Studio is being able to create graphs that allow them to view those metrics from a data mining perspective.  Many of the search phrases that appear in search console are variations of the same comment, sometimes making it hard to fully discern where one comment is associated with another. Importing the data into Data Studio can help analysts group phrases together. This is useful for establishing initial datasets for advanced techniques, like K-Nearest Neighbor for regression, or Association Rules Learning, a machine learning technique with growing popularity among retailers. Another benefit extends to how graphing options are meeting manager needs.  A straightforward set of charts is available to make data visualization easy to update.  A dashboard template is also available or you can create your own to custom-fit a specific need. Marketers are increasingly encountering scenarios where data usage must evolve to support competitive and strategic decisions.  Data Studio represents the latest evolution in analytic reporting — incorporating data sources to grant users more focus on data comparisons and decisions, while reducing the number of interfaces needed to make the comparison.  In short, it means analysis will get more comprehensive, but also much better.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The records collected by DeepMind went back over the past five years A deal between Google's artificial intelligence firm DeepMind and the UK's NHS had serious "inadequacies", an academic paper has suggested. More than a million patient records were shared with DeepMind to build an app to alert doctors about patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). The authors said that it was "inexcusable" patients were not told how their data would be used. Google's DeepMind said that the report contained "major errors". It told the BBC that it was commissioning its own analysis and rebuttal, which the authors said they welcomed. When the deal between London's Royal Free Hospital and DeepMind became public in February 2016, some three months after the data started to be collected, it caused controversy over the amount of patient information being shared and the lack of public consultation. Hal Hodson, a former New Scientist journalist, and co-author Julia Powles, a Cambridge University academic, said there are still big questions to be answered about the tie-up. "Why DeepMind, an artificial intelligence company wholly owned by data mining and advertising giant Google, was a good choice to build an app that functions primarily as a data-integrating user interface, has never been adequately explained by either DeepMind or Royal Free," they wrote. The app contains no artificial intelligence although DeepMind has said that it was hoping to incorporate AI techniques to create smarter alerts in future. The criticisms in the paper included: Questions over whether DeepMind could be considered a mere data processor when it developed an app - Streams - that had direct impact on patient care An absence of oversight or legally binding documents about how the data would be used Questions about whether the device was correctly registered with regulators In response, DeepMind and the Royal Free issued a joint statement: "This paper completely misrepresents the reality of how the NHS uses technology to process data. "It makes a series of significant factual and analytical errors, assuming that this kind of data agreement is unprecedented. "In fact, every trust in the country uses IT systems to help clinicians access current and historic information about patients, under the same legal and regulatory regime." The authors invited both to respond in an "open forum", adding: "The obvious fact is that we care about Google and DeepMind getting into healthcare because it is a break from the norm. "These companies are entirely different to specialised health IT and infrastructure providers, and the sweeping analogy does a disservice to the public." Investigation The NHS does have information-sharing agreements with a range of third-party firms, but this is the first such deal with a major US tech firm. DeepMind's initial assertion that the NHS had 1,500 other agreements with third-party organisations that process patient data has since been described by the NHS as "inaccurate". There is no central database on how many there are, the BBC was told. The app is currently the subject of an investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office while the National Data Guardian, tasked with safeguarding health data, is also looking at it. In a statement, the ICO told the BBC: "Our investigation into the sharing of patient information between the Royal Free NHS Trust and Deep Mind is close to conclusion. "We continue to work with the National Data Guardian and have been in regular contact with the Royal Free and Deep Mind who have provided information about the development of the Streams app. "This has been subject to detailed review as part of our investigation. It's the responsibility of businesses and organisations to comply with data protection law." The National Data Guardian added: "Our consideration of this matter has required a thorough approach in which the NDG and her panel have kept patients' rightful expectations of both good care and confidentiality at the forefront of discussions. "The NDG has provided a view on this matter to assist the ICO's investigation and looks forward to this being concluded as soon as practicable." Improved care DeepMind has been at pains to make clear that none of the data collected for the app has been shared with parent company Google. AKI is a serious condition, linked to 40,000 deaths a year in the UK and leading to a range of other health issues from minor kidney dysfunction to the need for dialysis and transplant. In February, DeepMind published details about how the app was improving patient care. It revealed that more than 26 doctors and nurses at the Royal Free are now using Streams and that each day it alerts them to 11 patients at risk of AKI. Sarah Stanley, a consultant nurse who leads the patients at risk and resuscitation team, said: "Streams is saving us a substantial amount of time every day. The instant alerts about some of our most vulnerable patients mean we can get the right care to the right patients much more quickly." DeepMind has acknowledged that it could have done better in the way it engaged with patients whose data was being used and, on the back of the criticism, agreed to set up patient forums. It published a strategy on future patient engagement which opens by saying: "Outcomes are better when patients and clinicians make decisions together."

If you’re not familiar with Slack, odds are you don’t work at a startup. This messaging platform has been taking workplaces by storm over the past few years. But Slack is facing new competition from new enterprise messaging platforms like Microsoft Teams, which launched earlier this week, and Google Hangouts Chat, which was announced last week as a private preview. This week on the GeekWire Podcast, we speak with Samir Diwan, the co-founder and CEO of Polly. Polly is a bot that runs polls and surveys in Slack, and now in Microsoft Teams and Google Hangouts Chat, as well. Polly CEO Samir Diwan We dive into the advantages of each platform, as well as potential drawbacks. We also learn more about Polly and get Diwan’s take on what has made Slack so successful. Listen to the podcast above or download it as an MP3, and keep reading for an edited transcript of our talk with Diwan.  Todd Bishop: You are a Microsoft veteran. You’ve now got your own startup that you’re running with your co-founder and you are basically building on top of these enterprise chat platforms. Just to take a step back, for people who haven’t used Slack, it’s pretty basic. It looks very simple when you go in there. It’s a chat tool with the ability to run bots on it. What has been so magical about this? Because it has a lot of users who are very passionate about it. Samir Diwan: It seems very simple and it actually is, conceptually. It just lets you communicate with your team. Persistent chat. We’re used to the old-school MSN Messenger and Skype for Business where you chat with somebody and it disappears. That’s what it seems like on the surface, that it’s just making communication easier. But the beauty of Slack is the way it really pulls in all aspects of your work into one place, and that makes it easier to be productive with your teammates, by interacting with people and with the tools that you use. And I think that’s really the magic behind Slack, that it allows you to do so many things beyond just communication.  I think that’s really the magic behind Slack, that it allows you to do so many things beyond just communication.Bishop: You write in a post on the Polly blog, that we also republished on GeekWire, that Slack is “becoming to the enterprise user what the iPhone has become to the consumer: the one thing users can’t live without, because their whole life is there.” I really experienced this myself using Slack. We’ve got a bunch of bots that run, so when somebody signs up for an event ticket or somebody pays their invoice or all sorts of different things, I automatically get notices. So it’s not just the hub for personal communication — you’re communicating with online services, as well. Diwan: That’s exactly it, and a lot of companies, what they’ll do is they won’t just interact with bots, they’ll actually write their own tools. They’ll write their own bots. And now essentially what you can do is automate company processes that previously you had to go out to the web for, or people did manually. A lot of those things are also finding their way into Slack so it’s not just third-party developers like us building for Slack but it’s the geeks within companies building things for everybody else. That just makes Slack more addictive and it gives it an advantage over all the other tools that they have because now you’re bringing in company processes as well. Bishop: With that as the backdrop, in just the past week we’ve seen some major announcements from Microsoft and Google. Google unveiled something called Google Hangouts Chat, which is an extension of their Hangouts messaging platform, and Microsoft on Tuesday went live with Microsoft Teams, which is part of Office 365. What do you think of them? Because — and we’ll get into this a little bit later — you offer the Polly bot for all three of these platforms, so you have some unique insights. What’s your take on this competition? Diwan: Competition, for us it’s great. Ideally these platforms push each other to build more functionality, build better products that service their users and as a result we can take advantage of that. Competition for us is great. I think each one of these players brings something unique. With Microsoft, it’s very obvious what their big strength is, and that’s their distribution. They’re giving Microsoft Teams away as part of Office 365. Their users don’t really need to pay anything extra and a lot of those users have been jealous of Slack but IT’s not letting them install it or they haven’t really experienced Slack and don’t know what the magic’s about. Microsoft has the ability to now replicate that with those users and also lean heavily on its Office brand with its integrations with Office around productivity tools, but also just get past that notion where IT, for whatever reason says, “Hey we’ve already paid for G-Suite or we’ve already paid for Office 365. We’re not going to pay for another tool.” This allows them to reach those users as well and start building that engagement that Slack has been enjoying from its user base. Microsoft Office CVP Kirk Koenigsbauer talks about Microsoft Teams at the product release event in Redmond, Wash. on Tuesday. (Microsoft Photo) Bishop: On Teams, people might be saying, “Oh wasn’t that launched like four months ago?” It was previously available on preview and the key with now the global availability is that users can get it by default now, unless the administrator turns it off. And before it was the other way around, the administrator had to proactively turn it on. And with 85 million commercial users of Office 365 out there, that’s a big market. Microsoft also is integrating a lot of Word and Excel and Outlook into Teams, lots of interesting stuff happening there. It’s almost becoming the hub of Office in some ways. I should say, you can envision it becoming that. Diwan: That’s why we’re building here. We’re trying to build a venture-backed company on the backs of these platforms. That’s because we believe it will be the hub. That is going to be the launching point for the enterprise worker, that’s what we believe. Just looking at those 85 million users, once the announcement actually went live with Microsoft Teams on Tuesday morning, we were just looking at our install rate and we, for a couple of hours, had one new team installing Polly every single minute. Bishop: Wow. Now they mentioned you during the event. Diwan: They did. Bishop: So I’m sure that helped. Diwan: I hope it did! Yeah, we’ve been working closely with the folks at Microsoft, both giving them feedback on what we think the platform should look like, how we can best unlock Polly’s capabilities on Microsoft teams. Hopefully they’ve been using that feedback to make the platform better. Bishop: With Google Hangouts Chat, what is their competitive differentiator?  Once the announcement actually went live with Microsoft Teams on Tuesday morning we were just looking at our install rate and we, for a couple of hours, had one new team installing Polly every single minute.Diwan: I think Google Hangouts right now, it’s still very early. Slack’s been in the market for over three years. Microsoft Teams, they announced their preview and have had users using the product for now four months. Google Hangouts, I feel like it’s a little early. What we do see is their commitment. If you look at what Google is doing and how they’ve been approaching a lot of their products toward the enterprise, they’ve been intentionally making this shift in a lot of their products to establish themselves as a big enterprise player. They’re trying to flex their muscle, and with Hangouts moving in that direction — it’s promising, but I think there’s a lot to be seen with Google right now. It’s really early to know where they actually stand in this mix. They also have some kind of a distribution advantage with G-Suite, which I believe is currently installed at over 3 million companies but we don’t exactly know the scale. They could be a bunch of small businesses. They haven’t really shared that information out, but it’s still a distribution channel that they can lean on. There is potential. Bishop: To that point, it’s still in private preview. In other words you have to request an invite and then they let you in. So Google Hangouts Chat is not something that just the average person could go out and use today in that form. Now Google Hangouts of course is obviously something that exists publicly — but this specific enterprise application that’s called Google Hangouts Chat is not available publicly yet. Diwan: Correct. Bishop: You say in your conclusion of your post assessing this market that it still comes down to developers. In fact you reference the famous Steve Ballmer quote, “Developers, developers, developers.” Why is that so important in this case?  When you extend the platform to developers, they build on these additional experiences which then bring in the users and tie them to that platform.Diwan: If you go back to why I think Slack is a big deal, it’s the fact that you can pull in all aspects of your work. Now a lot of these tools and these platforms, they can’t actually scale out to do everything. It’s the analogy to an operating system. When you extend the platform to developers, they build on these additional experiences which then bring in the users and tie them to that platform. They can’t live without it. And that really works well for company internal tools especially, because as the developers build these shortcuts, these tools that then make people’s lives more productive, more easier, and give them more information, that ties them to that platform. And switching now is more complicated. They get used to it and they love it. Bishop: The other big difference between Microsoft and Google and Slack is that Slack is an independent company, and Microsoft and Google, it’s almost like this is an outgrowth of their underlying cloud efforts. You’ve got Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform and it’s like, “OK if we have a cloud platform and a productivity suite well I guess we gotta kind of do this,” where it seems like Slack is just able have a startup’s focus. You know about this. They’re just drilled in on this one idea. Do you see them having an advantage because of that long term? Or is it a disadvantage because they don’t have all that infrastructure? Diwan:  I think the disadvantage that Slack has is they can’t lean on distribution. But I think one thing that Slack has shown is that they have really won the hearts and minds of developers and users, and this is something that Microsoft and Google still need to go prove. The way people use Slack, the engagement level is just so high and this goes back to what you mentioned around how I made the analogy to the iPhone, which is it’s the tool that people can’t live without. Right now Teams and Hangouts aren’t that, and Teams and Hangouts need to get to that in order for them to win this game. That’s my opinion, but I believe that to be true, and with Slack even though they don’t have this big infrastructure to lean on, essentially they’re coming at it the other way. They’re coming at it from the bottoms up.  I think one thing that Slack has shown is that they have really won the hearts and minds of developers and users and this is something that Microsoft and Google still need to go prove.There’s no reason why, if Slack continued down this path and continued to grow and continued to get all this engagement — they could easily move into other aspects of enterprise productivity like identity. Active Directory’s a big deal for Microsoft and if you scaled this out 10 years what would Slack be? And if it’s the one tool you can’t live without, then it just makes sense — let’s just tie identity to it and then at that point G-Suite, Office 365, Active Directory that kind of stuff gets at risk. I feel like a lot of this is potentially a defensive move but there’s a lot of value to be captured here for Microsoft and Google. Bishop: I know exactly what I would want Slack to add, if I could have one feature right off the bat. To-do lists. I want an integration — a real integration — between Trello and Slack. Trello is kanban-style organizer. We’ve explored doing Trello at Geekwire and I just can’t justify asking our reporters to go to a whole other tool, and the integration between Trello and Slack, it’s a little wonky. It’s not great. Diwan: Yeah. Bishop: Could you see Slack doing that? Diwan: I could see Slack potentially buying a tool to do that. I don’t see them building that from the ground up in-house. I think this is the classic, “Should they build it or should they let the ecosystem build it?” And in theory, the ecosystem should build it. I think a challenge that any developer is going to have is that there’s so many established players that it might be difficult to build something from the ground up that doesn’t match the expectations of the user. And so really it’s incumbent upon Trello or Asana or these kinds of tools to go build killer integrations into Slack. Just going back to our thesis of why we do what we do and why we think certain incumbents can’t do it that well, is that we’re building it for this interface. We’ve taken out the web. We’ve taken out email. And our objective is to nail it in Slack, to nail it in Teams, and to nail it in Hangouts. I think that’s why we’ve had success and I think until these bigger companies, or in this case an Asana or a Trello or one of these other list tools, doesn’t wholeheartedly adopt that, there’s going to be some gaps and that’s really what should happen. I don’t think Slack should build this in-house. Bishop: Okay, and by the way when I say to-do lists I guess the high-falutin’ phrase for that would be ‘task management and prioritization.” Workflow, I guess is what they would call it inside a big company. So tell us about Polly. You are a TechStars Seattle graduate, which means you’ve gone through the TechStars program, which is a way for companies just starting out to get some funding and experience and investors. What’s your elevator pitch for Polly? Diwan: I think you’ve already nailed our elevator pitch, which is we like to keep it simple. We’re re-imagining polls and surveys through a messaging interface for the enterprise user. That’s really what it is and if you want to dig in a little, our approach is to go from the ground up. Bishop: Inside a company, you want to know what the people on the front lines are thinking. Diwan: Exactly, and we want to build a tool for those people on the front lines. Slack has kind of paved the way for us and we’re just following that roadmap, versus classic enterprise software where you sell to the CIO or you sell to some exec or some administrator. We’re really trying to build a product that engages every single person at the organization and have them use the tool a lot and since we’re a survey company, we generate interesting data. If we have interesting data — selling it is a lot easier once you have the data. Bishop: I should install Polly on our Slack channel at GeekWire, right? Diwan: You should, I’m surprised you haven’t.  We’re really trying to build a product that engages every single person at the organization and have them use the tool lot and since we’re a polly survey company, we generate interesting data.Bishop: I will. I commit to you now that I will. Once I do that, tell me what will happen and what I can get from it as a manager, and then what employees here will get as employees. Diwan: We like to offer services that kind of span the spectrum. If you look at Slack, people who aren’t used to it will think, “Hey this is just about GIFs and animated pictures and jokes and emojis.” But then if you look at the other end of the spectrum, there’s serious work that happens and we like to do the same thing. We like to span that spectrum. You could have polls and surveys that are about jokes — which a lot of people do — about where should we go for lunch. The thing that we like to do is we like to make our product feel alive. Almost every aspect of Polly is interactive. When you vote, results update in real time right in front of you. We also have the ability to set up more sophisticated surveys, to set up surveys that take place over time and as soon as we get companies and teams tracking data over time, we can plot trends within the company. We can give managers or product leads insight on what teams think about the product. For example, is quality improving? Is quality going down? How is morale? How has the quality of meetings changed over the past three months because we tie polls to meeting events and as soon as meetings are over we get them to rate the quality of the meetings. All of these things are built into Polly, which allow you to generate data that allow you to track things at the company. Bishop: So here’s one potential use case. We have these debates, in fact we had an epic one yesterday afternoon, about headlines. Andwe kind of do it informally but usually we have three or four distinct options. Could a reporter here just go into Slack, set up a Polly survey, and put in four different headlines and have all of his or her coworkers vote on the best one? Diwan: Yeah I mean that’s super straightforward. You’d probably be up and running in a matter of seconds. The cool thing is just like Slack, the survey would live within Slack and you would be collaborating and interacting with the data right in front of you. You can now use Slack’s threaded functionality to start discussing the results of the survey or the headlines offering tweaks right there all in one place rather than me sending you the survey by email, everyone completes it, and everyone’s jumping back and forth. Bishop: You mentioned that after meetings there are post-event surveys. Does that happen automatically? In other words, does the bot know that the meeting has ended and then send out the survey? Diwan: So there isn’t that level of sophistication just yet. We haven’t built in integrations with Google Calendar yet. But the way we have it set up is the subject around the poll is set up for the meeting and you — for example, all hands meetings, they tend to happen around the same time every week or every month — so you just tie the timestamp of the recurrence to the meeting and as soon as the meetings ends. So if it’s supposed to end at 10 AM, at 10 AM the survey goes out. Bishop: Is the data anonymous? In other words, if I sent out a survey as a manager, do I see who voted for what? Diwan: We have the ability to toggle that, so you can have it so everyone can see everyone’s responses, which is useful for, “Hey where should we go for lunch?” It doesn’t really make sense to make it anonymous. But if there’s more sensitive things, like are you happy at work or what did you think about so and so’s plan, that you might want to make anonymous, we have the ability to do that. Bishop: And then is it transparent? In other words, not just anonymous but do people see the results. Diwan: It’s the same thing, it’s a toggle and when you author the poll we literally give you those options within seconds and it’s all within Slack. So it’s really easy to configure. It’s really easy to set up. Previously it was always complicated, you have all these toggles but Slack has given us a lot of interactive tools that make it really easy and effortless so people don’t have to think about it too much when they’re authoring these things. Bishop: You’ve raised some venture capital as you’ve said coming out of tech stars. Is it about 1.2 million? Am I remembering that correct? Diwan: Yeah, that’s right. Bishop: Where are you headed from here? How many employees do you have? What’s your road map ahead? Diwan: We’re currently at team of five. We’re hiring, so if anyone’s listening and they want to join the team come let me know. We’re looking for developers as always. Bishop: Yeah, you and everybody else. Diwan: Yeah, and we’re a team full of developers. We’re actually five engineers. Bishop: Oh wow. How’s that working out so far? Diwan: It’s great. Bishop: Who does the marketing? Diwan: You know, so all our marketing is — we actually haven’t had any outbound marketing. Everything — that’s the beauty of these platforms. They’re a massive distribution channel to enterprise users. It’s never existed before. We don’t have to worry too much about marketing. We do, but not as much as a typical company or a typical startup and I’m sure that’s gonna catch up to as at some point. From here, we basically launched on these other two platforms, but to get started we provide a pretty basic product. They’re making their way to be comparable to our offering in Slack, so there’s a lot to grow there. We’ve actually had a lot of new unique surveys being created by the community, so Polly users, and one thing that we’ve always wanted to do is start looking at the really creative things that people are doing and creating a template that other people can now opt into. And then at the same time, start benchmarking certain users against the rest of the Polly ecosystem. It really goes with our philosophy of trying to reach users from the bottoms up of an organization because now there’s so many different things that are happening. Traditional surveys are all just about HR and employee morale. We have so many things going on around project management, around product quality, around meetings, around sprints. There’s so many interesting data points being gathered and it’d be great to bring the ecosystem together so that way we could compare data anonymously. Bishop: Okay, very interesting. You’re based here in Seattle but did the company start here? Diwan: It did. My co-founder, Bilal Aijazi, he’s based out of the Bay Area. We met at Microsoft. He likes to say that I’m the second person he met when he moved to Seattle and we worked on partner teams at Microsoft. Go to know each other there. Eventually he left for the Valley to work at a consumer messaging startup, so he’s kind of had this whole messaging stuff in his head for a while now. Bishop: And how does Polly make money, or how will you make money? Diwan: We do make money, but we’re focused more on growth right now. But the way we make money and the way we will make money is to sell analytics back to the companies that are using the product. Bishop: So some sort of deep level of analysis of, over time, what the trends are. Diwan: Exactly. Bishop: So what do you think about Slack itself as a company in your interactions with them? They seem like such a successful startup. What’s been their secret that you’ve seen? Diwan: The one thing I see with Slack, and I feel like they do it better than anyone else, is their culture and it permeates to the relationships that they have with developers like us. When you visit Slack and you have meetings with them, they’re just full of energy. They’ve done an incredible job creating a community around building solutions for these platforms. They haven’t just started events for Slack but they’ve created events that bring together the entire messaging community, partnering with Microsoft, Google, Cisco. A bunch of other partners because they know ultimately they want people building for these platforms and that’s gonna result in their success.  The one thing I see with Slack, and I feel like they do it better than anyone else, is their culture.Bishop: Originally a Pacific northwest company or maybe a Pacific Southwest, to be more accurate. They were Canadian. Stewart Butterfield is from Vancouver or the Vancouver area I believe and they were actually based in Vancouver if I understand correctly. It started as a different company. There’s a whole history to Slack that is really interesting. Diwan: Yeah there’s definitely a history. I think Stewart still spends most of his time in Vancouver. Bishop: Yeah. My one last question: I love the bots — to me, bots are kind of like apps for Slack. What are your favorite bots, apart from Polly, for Slack? Diwan: I really like StatsBot. StatsBot essentially will pull in some of your analytics from mixed panel Google Analytics and essentially monitor it for you over time and it’ll send in some alerts based off of if it notices any trends that might be concerning or something that you need to pay attention to. It showcases how Slack brings transparency to an organization. Whereas before you would need to go one or two people would go to their Google Analytics account, look at it, and maybe share that data with everybody else. But essentially what a bot like this does is it pulls all that data and makes it transparent. That way everyone operates in the know and the cost to each person to know that is nothing, but you have more educated employees working for your company now.   GeekWire airs on KIRO Radio in Seattle (97.3 FM) at 8 p.m. Saturdays and 1 p.m. Sundays, except when pre-empted by live sports.

Most of those efforts have been based around its proprietary (and largely ignored by non-Google entities) WebP format, but a new project out of the company's research and open source divisions could help make JPEG images — one of the most common image formats on the planet — up to 35 per cent smaller, while retaining their quality. Image: AP The project is an image encoder called Guetzli (which is Swiss German for cookie; the project was born out of Google Research's Zurich office). In addition to making image files that are smaller, Guetzli is also focused on creating images that look better than other compressed images, too. Check out these comparisons Google offered up to show Guetzli compared to an uncompressed image or an image compressed using the common libjpeg encoder. The first image is uncompressed. The second is compressed with libjpeg. The third image was compressed with Guetzli and has fewer digital artifacts, even though its file size is smaller than the libjepeg file. (Image: Google) In fact, Google claims that its research shows that even when image file sizes are the same (meaning the libjpeg files are encoded in a higher quality setting, resulting in larger file sizes), human raters like the Guetzli images better. Again, the first image is uncompressed. The second image is encoded with libjpeg and the third image uses Guetzli. The more important thing, however, as Ars Technica notes, is that Guetzli works with the web browsers and file formats we already have. Other attempts at making images smaller have all relied on building new image formats that never get broad enough support to actually take off. The beauty of this project is that it creates JPEG images the world already uses. Google has made the Guetzli encoder open source, and it's available on Github for anyone to integrate into their own projects or to use on their own. That's a big deal because right now, many web-based image programs (and even stand alone image processing apps) use the libjpeg encoder because it is free and tends to do a good enough job. If Guetzli does work as well as Google claims, this could potentially be a solid libjpeg replacement for web developers, designers or photographers. It will also be good for regular web users because photos and images will take up less space. [Google via Ars Technica] Comments skrybe @skrybe Mar 18, 2017, 3:39pm Wish there were some better images to compare (as in real photos not just tiny sections cropped from a picture). I wonder how whether there is discrepancy between the way people perceive these images? I mean the whole blue & black -v- white & gold dress thing highlights the difference in peoples perception.

Google has finally allowed Gmail users to stream and preview video attachments without downloading them.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement The pains of receiving a video attachment, downloading it to your computer, then finally playing it with a media player, are real. It's a lengthy and inconvenient process especially in an era of cloud-based inclinations. Google, as it appears, believes so, too. As such, Gmail will no longer require its users to download video attachments just to preview them, at least on the desktop version. Rolling out now, the new feature will let users stream the attachment thanks to the principle also used behind Google Drive, YouTube, and other products, according to the company. Gmail Video Attachments No Longer Requires Downloading Starting Thursday, March 16, Gmail users on desktop can finally do away with video downloads; they may simply check out the contents of a video by virtue of a streaming preview directly integrated inside the email interface, Google announced. Users can adjust playback, set quality and sound levels, and even stream the video attachment to a Chromecast device, although this appears to still be a work in progress, as tested by The Verge. Why This Is Important This minor, but handy update to Gmail is important primarily for two reasons, as pointed out by SlashGear. First, it saves storage, time, and effort. Especially for large video files, downloading isn't the most attractive recourse. Let alone if the user's internet isn't too dependable. Second, it lets users decide if a video is actually worth downloading at all, or whether a preview is enough for them to go by. This primarily benefits those who have small snippets or clips to send to friends coworkers, or relatives, letting them save a step or two. Of course, Google still won't lift its file size limit — 25 MB maximum for sending, and 50 MB maximum for receiving — but at least video attachments won't be a pain to deal with starting now. But what if you want to send larger videos? No problem at all, as uploading it to Google Drive, the company's own cloud storage platform, comes as an easy recourse. Video Previews On Other G Suite Applications Likely? Since Gmail's video attachment preview system uses the same principle responsible for Google Drive and YouTube videos, as previously mentioned, streaming and previews could also be baked into other G Suite applications later on. The new handy feature follows another recently announced feature on Gmail which lets users send and receive payments by virtue of attachments. It works as easy as it sounds: type up an email, select the "Send money" attachment option, pick an amount, write an optional memo, and hit send. The payments may be sent to non-Gmail users, and may even be directly transferred to the recipient's bank account, which is neat. Gmail's video preview is rolling out now and is expected to become available to all users in the next 15 days. Thoughts about gmail's new streaming and preview for video attachments?

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google March 14, 2017 Dwave sells 2000 qubit quantum annealing to Volkswagen, Virginia Tech and upgrades systems for NASA and Google adiabatic quantum computer, dwave, google, infrastructure, nasa, quantum, quantum annealing, qubits, security, space, traffic Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit D-Wave Systems, who has commercial 2000 qubit quantum adiabatic computing systems, announced that Google, NASA, and Universities Space Research Association (USRA) have elected to upgrade their D-Wave 2X™ quantum computer to the new D-Wave 2000Q™ system, under the terms of their multi-year agreement, to support QuAIL's pioneering research on how quantum computing can be applied to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and difficult optimization problems. Google and Nasa and Space Research Association upgrade to 2000 qubit Dwave “The new system will be the third generation of D-Wave technology installed at Ames,” said D-Wave CEO Vern Brownell. “We are pleased that Google, NASA, and USRA value the increased performance embodied in our latest generation of technology, the D-Wave 2000Q system, for their critical applications.” Since 2013, when the first D-Wave system was installed at Ames, scientists at Google, NASA, and USRA have been using it for a broad range of complex problems such as web search, speech recognition, planning and scheduling, air-traffic management, robotic missions to other planets, and support operations in mission control centers. “We appreciate that the new processor offers more controls for each qubit, which enables us to experiment with new quantum-enhanced optimization and sampling algorithms,” said Hartmut Neven, Director of Engineering for Google and Head of the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab. Dwave and Virginia Tech partner to provide quantum computing for US Intelligence and Defense Dwave and Virginia Tech have established a joint effort to provide greater access to quantum computers for researchers from the Intelligence Community and Department of Defense. D-Wave and Virginia Tech will work towards the creation of a permanent quantum computing center to house a D-Wave system at the Hume Center for National Security and Technology. The Hume Center leads Virginia Tech's research, education, and outreach programs focused on the challenges of cybersecurity and autonomy in the context of national and homeland security. Education programs provide mentorship, internships, and scholarships, and seek to address key challenges in qualified US citizens entering federal service. Current research initiatives include cyber-physical system security, orchestrated missions, and the convergence of cyber warfare and electronic warfare. “Both D-Wave and Virginia Tech recognize how vital it is that quantum computing be accessible to a broad community of experts focused on solving real-world problems,” said Bo Ewald, president of D‑Wave International. “One of the many reasons we chose to work with Virginia Tech is their strong relationships with the intelligence and defense communities. A key area of focus will be to work with federal agencies towards the creation of a quantum computing center at the Hume Center.” Volkswagen using Dwave systems IT experts from the Volkswagen Code Lab in San Francisco are working on a research project for traffic flow optimization The Volkswagen Group is the world’s first automaker to use quantum computers, further expanding its digital competence for the future. In this context, Volkswagen Group IT is cooperating successfully with leading quantum computing company D-Wave Systems on a research project for traffic flow optimization. In the course of this project, IT experts from the Volkswagen labs in San Francisco and Munich have been the first to develop a smart mobility program on the D-Wave quantum computer. Quantum computers can solve highly complex problems many times faster than conventional supercomputers. To date, quantum computing technology has been used primarily by scientific institutes, government agencies, and in the aerospace sector. At CeBIT 2017 in Hanover, Volkswagen and D-Wave will be announcing their strategic cooperation and, as a world premiere, demonstrating a software program that optimizes traffic flow on a quantum computer. In the course of this project, experts from the Volkswagen Code Lab in San Francisco and the Volkswagen Data Lab in Munich and used data from approximately 10,000 taxis in Beijing. Dr. Martin Hofmann, CIO of the Volkswagen Group, says: “We are doing digital pioneering work. Quantum computing technology can bring tremendous progress to Volkswagen with respect to all the key IT topics of the future. We are now laying the foundation for the future by learning to make effective use of the strengths of a quantum computer. Our cooperation with D-Wave is a milestone on the way to the digital future of our Group. This shows that there is no other company where IT is now as exciting as at Volkswagen.” Robert “Bo” Ewald, President of D-Wave International, says: “The goal of our cooperation with Volkswagen is to apply our quantum computing technology to Volkswagen’s real-world computing challenges and make a positive impact on their business. Bringing together our quantum computing experts with their automotive AI experts is the perfect model to make significant progress toward that goal. This project is a great example of how computing in the future will be done, with talented people looking at new ways to solve old problems, and combining traditional computers with quantum computers to deliver an improved solution.” The strategic cooperation between the two companies focuses on the joint use of quantum computing systems. Experts from the Volkswagen Group IT labs are testing the programming of applications and algorithms on D-Wave’s quantum computer. This will result in the development of specialist expertise at Volkswagen and on the identification of meaningful applications that would benefit from the application of quantum computing within the Group. The first research project is traffic flow optimization in the Chinese mega-metropolis of Beijing. Data scientists and AI specialists from Volkswagen have successfully programmed an algorithm to optimize the travel time of all public taxis in the city. The computing principle of a quantum computer is especially well-suited for this project because it natively solves optimization problems. In simplified terms, an optimization problem considers how a specific resource (such as time, money or energy) can be used in the best possible way in a certain scenario. The complexity of the task and therefore the computing capacity required grow exponentially with the number of factors to be considered, taking conventional digital computers to their limits. The Volkswagen Group is the first automaker to work intensively with quantum computing technology. Group IT expects a wide range of application possibilities especially in the areas of autonomous driving, the robotic enterprise (AI-supported process control), the smart factory, machine learning and intelligent mobility solutions. Further projects with D-Wave are to follow. Initially, the main focus is on the acquisition of specialist knowledge. The IT experts are testing applications and algorithms to make the best possible use of the tremendous computing potential of D-Wave‘s quantum computer. In addition, the Volkswagen Group plans to intensify cooperation with universities and scientific institutes in the field of quantum computing.

Following its announcement at MWC last month, LG’s latest phone has been pretty well received, and now we’re in the home stretch for its official debut. So, here’s where you can pre-order an LG G6 in the United States. The best gifts for Android users Verizon Verizon today opened up pre-orders for the G6 ahead of an April 7th release date. Pricing lands at $672 in full, or $28/month over 24 months. As previously revealed, Verizon also has a huge selection of promotions going along with the phone. Those promos include a free Google Home which LG is offering, a trade-in credit of up to $200 with select smartphones, and a free 43-inch LG TV. To get all three you’ll need to be a new customer signing up for the carrier’s new Unlimited plan. However, you’ll be able to get the Google Home regardless, as long as you order early. Verizon says that early orders will begin shipping on March 30th. LG G6 at Verizon Wireless AT&T AT&T’s LG G6 is the same unit you’ll find elsewhere, but with a slightly higher price tag. AT&T is charging $719 for the G6 at retail cost, or $24 a month over the course of 30 months. Alternatively, the carrier is also offering payments over 24 months of $30 per month. Pre-orders ship in the first week of April, and AT&T is also offering up LG’s free Google Home offer. Further, customers can get a LG Watch Sport for $49 with a 2-year agreement, as well as take advantage of a BOGO offer on the device. LG G6 at AT&T T-Mobile T-Mobile has already revealed early offers and pricing for the G6 on its network, but it hasn’t opened up pre-orders just yet. Pricing for the phone lands at $650, or $26 a month for 24 months, the least expensive pricing we’re seeing on any carrier so far. T-Mobile is, of course, also offering up LG’s free Google Home offer to anyone who buys before April 30th. LG G6 at T-Mobile Sprint Sprint’s pre-orders for the LG G6 offer up perks that only Verizon rivals, namely, a free Google Home and a free 49-inch LG TV. That promo extends until May 11th and comes along with a $708 retail price tag. Monthly pricing falls at $29.50/month for 24 months depending on your credit. LG G6 at Sprint Best Buy & Other Retailers Best Buy is also offering up pre-orders for the LG G6, but not the unlocked unit. Rather, the retailer is offering up pre-0rders for carrier variants from Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint. Prices are slightly escalated in this case, and all ship starting April 7th. Other retailers like Amazon and B&HPhoto are also signed up to sell the phone, but haven’t revealed any details just yet.

Apparently above the law, they allow on their platforms the most depraved content, from extreme pornography to terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse. Adverts for the Home Office, the Royal Navy and the BBC have been run beside videos by the likes of US white nationalist and ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke In the latest sickening twist, we learn that rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers receive taxpayers’ money when government-funded adverts appear alongside their YouTube videos. Adverts for the Home Office, the Royal Navy and the BBC have been run beside videos by the likes of US white nationalist and ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Major commercial brands have also been affected. Adverts for Argos, Sainsbury’s and The Guardian appeared next to videos by US preacher Steven Anderson, who praised a terror attack on a gay nightclub. Google, which owns YouTube, rightly stands accused of profiting from hatred. But while this lax approach is deeply disconcerting, it is hardly a surprise. For many years, Google – like Facebook and Twitter – has wilfully turned a blind eye to poisonous content. Last week, the BBC reported that of the 100 sexualised and lewd images of children it reported to Facebook site monitors, only 18 were taken down. Last week, the BBC reported that of the 100 sexualised and lewd images of children it reported to Facebook site monitors, only 18 were taken down. Pictured, a BBC advert next to a neo-Nazi video The other 82 – including a freeze frame apparently from an abuse video – were allowed to remain. Worse, when it was confronted over its pusillanimous response, the site reported the BBC to the police. Last year, the home affairs committee condemned all three web giants for acting as the ‘lifeblood of Islamic State’, by ‘consciously failing’ to stop terrorists and their sympathisers from targeting the vulnerable with bile on their sites.

Advertising agency with Royal Mail and O2 as clients says... Share this article Share As senior security officials have warned, tech firms often refuse to help the authorities identify suspected terrorists, citing privacy concerns. But at the same time, they ruthlessly invade the privacy of their users by gathering their personal information and exploiting it commercially. Meanwhile, endless fake news and blatant libels are spread with impunity around the world. Unlike newspapers in this country, which follow strict regulations, content from web publishers such as Facebook and Google is almost entirely unregulated. We reveal how internet giants like Facebook and Google publish material aimed at young women which glamorises eating disorders and self-harm Today the Mail adds to the already lengthy charge sheet. Alongside all the other destructive influences on their sites, we reveal how these internet giants publish material aimed at young women which glamorises eating disorders and self-harm. And when this newspaper’s reporters began investigating backstreet beauty clinics offering to inject young women with dangerous lip-fillers, where do you think some of the adverts appeared? Facebook, of course. For any parent already worried about what their children are viewing online, it is enough to make them hurl the computer out of the window. But at last the tide may be turning. In a hugely significant step, ministers yesterday removed government advertising from YouTube, and hauled in its executives for a dressing down. And in another welcome move, major advertising firms are asking their clients if they want to pull YouTube ads. Rightly, no chief executive wants their branding to pop up alongside a hate video. But the response must not end there. Concerted political action is needed to impose regulatory controls over the anarchic internet. Unlike David Cameron, whose close colleagues were hand-in-glove with the web giants, Theresa May has no such questionable relationships. She is therefore free to confront the issue head on. She could start by instructing HMRC officials to look at how Google shifts its earnings around the world to avoid tax.

Havas yesterday became the first of the big global marketing groups to pull all its UK ad spend from Google and its subsidiary YouTube. Reuters 4 Advertiser desert Internet giant Google over cash to extremists Its clients include O2, BBC, Royal Mail and it’s thought to spend £175m a year on web ads. It emerged yesterday that taxpayers’ cash is among marketing sums going to the likes of Islamic jihadists and white supremacists who have hits on YouTube. 4 Havas’s UK boss Paul Frampton says company has duty of care to its clients The Government pulled advertising from Google and YouTube as a result. And a powerful committee of MPs last night accused Google bosses of profiting from hatred for allowing sickening videos on its YouTube site. Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper also questioned how the firm was able to quickly remove footage from YouTube if it was found to breach copyright — but was so slow when material was from banned groups spouting hate.

Russian fake news blog 'behind White House claims GCHQ tapped Trump DEFENCE DEAL Britain set to sign new defence co-operation deal with Germany after Theresa May triggers Brexit MPs found the internet giant was STILL showing taxpayer-funded ads alongside extremist content. One of the videos they found was from the neo-Nazi movement National Action which featured masked men shouting “they fear us because they think we will gas them, and we will”. They branded the internet giant’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” as “extremely troubling”. The Commons committee has now written to Google for an explanation into how Government ads were placed on “inappropriate and hate-filled sites” and YouTube videos. It follows a three hour Commons showdown with Google’s public affairs boss Peter Barron earlier this week. He admitted the web giant never searches for terrorist or paedophile content on its YouTube site. News Group Newspapers Ltd 4 Yvette Cooper also questioned why Google was so slow removing material from banned groups And he revealed supporters of ISIS and neo-Nazi groups may be making money from page views of YouTube videos. Ms Cooper said: “Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred.“It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content.” The internet giant’s UK boss Ronan Harris has admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat what it called “bad advertising”. Havas took action after talks with Google broke down. The tech company had been “unable to provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters”. PA:Press Association 4 Google’s public affairs boss Peter Barron made admission during Commons showdown Firms wanting to advertise use marketing agencies who in turn bid for packages of web space on sites like Google and YouTube. The problem arises because there is so much content on the web — millions of videos, blogs, forums and niche news sites — that adverts like are placed next to content by computers since it takes too long for a human to do it. But computers are not yet able to work out that adverts for big brands should not be placed next to certain content. Havas’s UK boss Paul Frampton said: “We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace to position their brands in the right context where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands’ objectives.” Google's incredible timelapse video shows decades passing by in seconds He said: “Our position will remain until we are confident” Google can “deliver the standards we and our clients expect.” The world’s biggest marketing group is WPP. Its boss Sir Martin Sorrell has criticised Google but not blacklisted it yet. He said: “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company.” “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.”   The Sun Topics Google Social Media Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular KIM BOMB UN Kim Jong-Un vows to reduce US 'to ashes' with nukes if Donald Trump fires 'a single bullet' at North Korea News Exclusive HAMSTER'S 2ND HORROR CRASH Grand Tour host Richard Hammond is badly hurt in motorbike crash 11 years after almost dying in… TV & Showbiz SOME SWIM WRONG This woman stuns the web after showing off her bikini... but can YOU spot what's wrong with it?

Guetzli is a JPEG encoder for digital images and web graphics that can yield much smaller JPEG files while maintaining compatibility with existing browsers and other JPEG-using software. Google announced, "And while Guetzli produces smaller image file sizes without sacrificing quality, we additionally found that in experiments where compressed image file sizes are kept constant that human raters consistently preferred the images Guetzli produced over libjpeg images, even when the libjpeg files were the same size or even slightly larger. We think this makes the slower compression a worthy tradeoff."

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Aarian Marshall. Aarian Marshall Transportation Date of Publication: 03.17.17. 03.17.17 Time of Publication: 7:39 pm. 7:39 pm A Simple Theory for Uber’s Waymo Mess: Plain Old Sloppiness Operation staff at Otto climb into the cab of a self-driving big-rig truck during a demonstration at the Otto headquarters in San Francisco. Tony Avelar/AP The allegations are spicy, the insinuations downright fiery. In a lawsuit filed last month in San Francisco, Google’s autonomous vehicle spinoff Waymo accuses former engineer Anthony Levandowski of stealing 14,000 pages of intellectual property and trade secrets, then using them to launch his robotruck startup, Otto. Just four months later, Uber acquired Otto for a reported $680 million—and that, Waymo alleges, is how the ride-hailing giant started using Google’s vital circuit board and sensor setup in its own self-driving cars. Some folks, reading between the lines of the lawsuit, see a conspiracy: Perhaps Uber directly conspired with Levandowski to steal Google’s self-driving secrets. ‘It’s so dangerous to be hiring a very knowledgeable former employee of another company and put him in a position in your company to do the same thing.’ As seductive as you may find this narrative, there may be a far simpler explanation, one grounded in Uber’s storied history of gleefully breaking rules. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that Waymo’s central allegation is true: Levandowski downloaded the documents, and Uber used Google smarts in its own sensor designs. If so, the mess embroiling Uber may stem not from a conspiracy among evil geniuses, but a brash disregard for standard operating procedure. Sound familiar? How to Acquire a Startup—the Smart Way If Uber followed best practices, its deep dive into Otto’s tech would have started well before it finalized the purchase. An invading team of crack technical and legal experts would have created a “data room”—sometimes physical, sometimes virtual—where they might have pawed through documents to guarantee Levandowski’s Otto was legit. “For many companies, their assets are patents or intellectual property, so there’s a lot of due diligence in reviewing those,” says Manita Rawat, a patent attorney with the law firm Duane Morris. Job number one: Ensuring the technology you’re paying bank for doesn’t actually belong to someone else. Waymo vs Uber Aarian Marshall Google Tries to Run Uber Off the Road—in Court Alex Davies Uber’s Massive Crap Pile Develops Its Own Gravity Alex Davies Google’s Lawsuit Against Uber Revolves Around Frickin’ Lasers Alex Davies Google Accuses Uber of Stealing Its Self-Driving Car Tech Easier said than done. The world of patents is wide, and it can be difficult to spot infringement or lifted trade secrets on the fly. But any Uber team looking into Otto should have been extra sensitive to the weird optics of buying a new startup for hundreds of millions just a few months after its founder left the leading self-driving outfit. “It would seem obvious to ask the question: ‘How was that technology developed and how do you give me as a buyer comfort that we’re not going to find ourselves in a dispute?'” says attorney Mark Seneca, a mergers and acquisitions specialist at the law firm Orrick. If Uber had done that—and it might have!—it should have little trouble defending itself against allegations that it stole IP. (“We will have a chance to tell our side of the story in upcoming filings and look forward to that opportunity,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement.) Uber also ought to have done some digging on Otto’s employees. A smart firm looking to buy a company will know which workers are coming from which companies, and the potential conflicts of interest those associations could create. If you’re about to hire someone with serious know-how on tech you’re trying a crack, you want to take precautions to guarantee she doesn’t pass on any secrets—even by mistake. “It’s so dangerous to be hiring a very knowledgeable former employee of another company and put him in a position in your company to do the same thing,” says Courtland Reichman, a trial lawyer at law firm McKool Smith who litigates trade secret and patent infringement cases. How do you make sure an acqui-hire doesn’t contribute even inadvertently stolen info to your own self-driving unit? You start by making him sign a contract saying he won’t, to protect the company if something goes awry. But that alone isn’t enough to guarantee a firm won’t be found liable for infringement or theft in court. Even smarter: You create a firewall between the secret-laden employee and the team working on the tech. You instruct them to not communicate with each other. You physically or technologically deny the employee access to vital documents or servers dealing with that tech. And you document it all, in writing. “You’d want to have a record that, if you got sued, will establish that you independently created the technology,” says Reichman. It is, of course, very possible that Uber did all this meticulous work, and defending itself against Waymo’s charges will be a snap. (The dispute is ongoing, with a next hearing set for late April.) In the messy world of startups and fast-developing tech, things can go wrong, and blunders can be well-meaning. But in the messy world of startups and fast-developing tech, things can go wrong, and blunders can be well-meaning. “Issues come up, and companies learn—we all learn from our mistakes,” says Rawat, the patent attorney. Still, Silicon Valley also has a long history of being loosey-goosey with rules, a culture that prizes acting now and begging for forgiveness later—just ask Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Under his leadership, the company made its name on a cavalier attitude toward red tape and regulations—when it aggressively pushed its way around taxi commissions in new markets, when it used a specialized program to dodge regulators, and when it launched self-driving passenger service in San Francisco without a permit. A slapdash approach to a big acquisition doesn’t sound like a stretch. For other tech companies, this dispute might plant a much-needed “DANGER” sign. “Cases like this are so important for understanding trade secrets and the devaluation of intellectual property, so people see what’s right and wrong,” says Reichman. It’s tempting to see conspiracy, especially when the stakes are so high—if Uber really did conspire to steal Waymo tech, there could be grounds for criminal economic espionage charges and expensive compensation. But for Uber, a potent mix of sloppiness and arrogance could be just as costly. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Autonomous Vehicles corporate espionage google Uber Skip Social.

(Google/TNS) Smart jackets are coming . just not as soon as originally planned. And if you want one, be prepared to shell out $350. Those are the latest updates from a partnership between Levi’s and Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects lab, according to The Verge. The project’s leaders announced the news on stage at this year’s South by Southwest music, film and tech festival in Austin, Texas. The high-tech piece of outerwear is part of Project Jacquard, an initiative launched in 2015 by Levi’s and Google that seeks to weave the internet into clothing. As the first piece of clothing to come out of that partnership, the jacket will let you interact with your smartphone by tapping your sleeve. Levi’s says it’s perfect for people like bicyclists, who want to change their music, ignore calls from their boss and get directions while in the middle of a ride. A video on the company’s website shows a cyclist biking through traffic while using the jacket. The key is a tag in the jacket that wirelessly connects your smartphone to the conductive yarns woven into the cuff, allowing you to use your sleeve to send signals to your phone. Take the tag out, and the jacket is washable, according to the Levi’s website. “Over time additional features will be added to further make this jacket your co-pilot for life, on or off your bike,” the company promises. If the prospect of connected clothing excites you, one day you might be able to have an entire smart outfit. Remember the Google Hat the internet giant got a patent for last month? But apparently it’s taking longer than the Levi’s and Google team leaders thought it would to perfect their existing jacket technology. The jacket’s debut, initially planned for this spring, has been pushed back until fall, according to The Verge.

The company however recently decided to make it available on all smartphones running Android Marshmallow and up. While the fine print didn't say that tablets would be getting support, users assumed that any device running on Android Marshmallow and upwards with Google Play Services should be able to get Assistant. However, Google has now confirmed that tablets won't be getting Google Assistant, and the support is only exclusive to phones. Furthermore, a separate report claims that Google Assistant is now serving ads, and one such instance was found on Google Home where it randomly spoke about the movie Beauty and the Beast out of context while narrating the day's summary. In a statement to Android Police, Google said that it will not roll out Assistant support to tablets. "The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play services, this does not include tablets," the statement explicitly reads. The motive behind Google holding back support for tablets is not clear as of now, but it could just be a marketing gimmick. The company could be launching a tablet with Assistant support, and may look to do a wider rollout post the launch of the tablet. In any case, this is all speculation and the real reason behind it is unknown. Separately, Assistant on Google Home is reportedly promoting advertisements while narrating the day's summary - a feature that is very popular with Assistant. A Twitter user going by the name brysonmeunier tweeted a video of Google Home pushing a Beauty and Beast ad in the middle of narrating his day's summary. Google claims that it wasn't meant to be an ad, but can see why it seems like that. "This wasn't intended to be an ad. What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case," the company told 9to5Google in a statement. Apart from the Twitter user, many others also heard the same movie announcement on Google Home and their Pixel phones as well. Calling out timely content without the user's permission is still quite invasive and unwanted, and still hedges around the grey area of advertising. Let's hope that such unwanted content doesn't crop up more and more on Google Home.

The European Union is fed up with online consumer scams, and it is asking Google, Facebook, and Twitter to do something about them. Under a directive issued on Friday, the EU will soon require social media companies to remove fraud or scams that appear on their websites as soon as they're made aware of them. The move brings social media in line with the EU's e-commerce laws governing the procedures for removing illegal online content. The push to hold Facebook, Twitter, and Google accountable for fraud and scams began last fall, and the companies will have one month from Friday to comply with the new rules. In a statement, EU Commissioner Vera Jourova said the rules are necessary given social media's impact on people's daily lives. "Given the growing importance of online social networks, it is time to make sure that our strong EU rules, that are there to protect consumers from unfair practices, are complied with in this sector," Jourova said. Related Don't Fall for This Sophisticated Gmail Phishing Scam Don't Fall for This Sophisticated Gmail Phishing Scam American tech companies have long been subjected to the watchful eye of EU regulators, and their illegal actions are often punished with stiff fines or enforcement actions. In this case, however, the EU has taken a softer approach that is likely related to the companies' well-developed ability to filter out objectionable content. Facebook and Google have invested heavily in artificial intelligence algorithms that can detect objectionable content. By ensuring that the companies add what the EU considers objectionable—scams involving $1 smartphones, for instance—to their watch lists, regulators hope to have an easier time of cleaning up the internet. Still, the approach isn't perfect, as the companies have failed to deliver on their content-filtering promises before. Google recently admitted that it can do more to prevent ads from being displayed alongside objectionable YouTube videos, and multiple advocacy groups have criticized tech companies for not doing enough to detect and remove hate speech.

Google on Friday pledged to more closely monitor advertisements that appear alongside YouTube videos, following several British advertisers' decisions to pull their ads after discovering that some appeared with videos containing extremist, homophobic, or racist content. The British government pulled millions of dollars worth of advertising from YouTube after an investigation by The Times of London found that the government's ads were displayed alongside videos from "rape apologists, anti-Semites, and banned hate preachers." The videos, some of which were uploaded by American white nationalist David Duke, carried ads from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, among other advertisers, the Times found. A spokesperson for the UK's Cabinet Office told the BBC that it had temporarily restricted YouTube advertising until Google can prove that the ads are being delivered in a "safe and appropriate way." Google said that it tries to ensure that ads don't appear alongside videos that violate the company's monetization policies, and that it also offers advertisers control over where their ads appear. But the company acknowledged that "inappropriately monetized" videos still appear. Related Fighting ISIS, One YouTube Ad at a Time Fighting ISIS, One YouTube Ad at a Time "We've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network," Google's UK managing director Ronan Harris wrote in a blog post. The Cabinet Office was paid more than $7 for every 1,000 YouTube viewers who watched its ads, according to the Times. Cabinet ministers summoned Google representatives on Friday to discuss its advertising policies. Several other advertisers, including The Guardian and British ad agency Havas, also pulled their content from YouTube this week over fears that it would appear alongside objectionable videos. As Google struggles to keep its advertisers' content away from extremist videos, it is attempting to divert viewers away from those videos as well. Last summer, a Google subsidiary called Jigsaw began experimenting with ads that redirect people searching for extremist content to videos that portray extremist groups like ISIS in a negative light, such as YouTube clips of Muslim clerics pointing out ISIS's hypocrisy.

Home Industry French advertisement group Havas says only UK unit pulling adverts from Google French advertisement group Havas says only UK unit pulling adverts from Google French advertising group Havas said on Friday that it would not pull advertising from Alphabet Inc's Google platforms on a global basis, after its British business suspended activity with the U.S. company over concerns about its YouTube website. By: Reuters | Published: March 18, 2017 5:28 AM The Guardian newspaper reported that Havas had decided to pull all its advertising from Google and YouTube, citing Havas UK chief Paul Frampton.(Reuters) French advertising group Havas said on Friday that it would not pull advertising from Alphabet Inc’s Google platforms on a global basis, after its British business suspended activity with the U.S. company over concerns about its YouTube website. The British government had been expected to question Google executives on Friday on why ads marketing government services were appearing alongside videos carrying hate speech and extremist content on YouTube. The Guardian newspaper reported that Havas had decided to pull all its advertising from Google and YouTube, citing Havas UK chief Paul Frampton. However, Havas Chief Executive Yannick Bollore tweeted that he had been unaware of its British unit’s decision. A spokeswoman later said the rest of the group would not follow suit. You may also like to watch: “The decision of our UK team to pause activity with our partner Google is a temporary move made by the local team on behalf of our UK clients and their specific needs,” she said in an emailed statement. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK.” Google said early on Friday in a statement that it worked hard to prevent ads from appearing on pages or videos with “hate speech, gory or offensive content” and that it had launched a review to give brands more control over where their ads appeared.   Please Wait while comments are loading...

The Mountain View company said in a blog post Friday that it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites and on search results. The announcement came after the British government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content. French advertising and marketing company Havas pulled all its British clients’ ads from Google and YouTube on Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail, British Broadcasting Corp., Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said. “We have a duty of care to our clients ... to position their brands in the right context where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands’ objectives,” said Paul Framphon, CEO and country manager for Havas in Britain. “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the British government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Google made $7.8 billion in advertising revenue in the United Kingdom in 2016, accounting for 8.6 percent of the company’s total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against programs that automate the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook, claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. The controversy about ads appearing in inappropriate contexts may give these media buyers leverage in negotiations with the companies. Martin Sorrell, founder and CEO of WPP, the global advertising firm, said in a statement that Google and Facebook have “the same responsibilities as any media company” and could not “masquerade” as mere technology platforms. He said WPP’s GroupM, a major ad buyer, was talking to Google “at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues.” Ronan Harris, Google’s managing director in Britain, said in the blog post that Google removed nearly 2 billion offensive ads last year and blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company’s Ad Sense program. Despite this, Harris wrote, “We don’t always get it right.” Harris said Google had “heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content.” The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads from appearing on objectionable websites or with offensive videos, Harris said. Ads appeared “next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube and its parent company Google, the British publisher said in an email Friday. The government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure the ads are not placed next to content it doesn’t approve of. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,” the government said in an email. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.” Joe Mayes and Jeremy Kahn are Bloomberg writers.

The Home Affairs Select Committee has written to the technology giant asking for an explanation into how Government adverts were placed on “inappropriate and hate-filled sites” and YouTube videos. The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”, while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. In a letter to Google ’s communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Government advertisements and major brands' advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites.

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world’s largest marketing services group WPP, was critical of Google but fell short of blacklisting the company. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” said Sorrell. “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On YouTube Google Yvette Cooper Advertising News all Most Read Most Recent Martin McGuinnessMartin McGuinness dead at 66: Former IRA commander and key player in Northern Ireland peace process killed by rare disease His death comes just weeks after the controversial politician - the former commander of the Provisional IRA - was diagnosed with a rare incurable disease Crown courtSick paedophile monster raped girl 225 times from the age of six Anthony Morgan, 41, carried out a "campaign of rape" against the victim which left her traumatised CrimeMan charged with murder of one-year-old boy and attempted murder of twin sister after alleged hammer attack Bidhya Sagar Das, 33, will appear before magistrates over the murder of baby Gabriel while sister Maria is still in a critical condition in hospital BikinisBikini-clad women square up before one is knocked out with brutal punch - then third TWERKS over her Recorded during a beach party in the holiday mecca of South Padre Island in Texas the clip shows the stand-off before one particularly mad looking girl ends the argument Football hooligansRussia's Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at World Cup In a shock investigation, the Mirror tracked down the leaders of the country’s two most notorious “Ultra” gangs Martin McGuinnessMartin McGuinness dead at 66: Former IRA commander and key player in Northern Ireland peace process killed by rare disease His death comes just weeks after the controversial politician - the former commander of the Provisional IRA - was diagnosed with a rare incurable disease British Summer TimeWhen do the clocks go forward in 2017?

In a devastating attack, MPs said the technology firm had totally failed to control offensive online content. Its bosses were charged with breaking promises – made just days ago – to ensure neither the firm, nor extremists, cashed in on vile propaganda. Google has been accused of profiting from hatred. Government bodies like the BBC have suspended advertising with YouTube after their adverts played alongside videos of 'hate crime' The Commons home affairs committee said it was astonishing that the second richest company on the planet had failed to take even the simplest steps to root out abuse.  The £482billion American firm suffered a further blow yesterday when ministers suspended all government advertising on its YouTube video-sharing platform. The Cabinet Office said the ban would be lifted only when Google could all but guarantee public money would not fund hate-fuelled content. Officials learnt that adverts for public bodies such as UK Aid and the Metropolitan Police had been running alongside YouTube videos containing extremist material.  The Cabinet Office said the ban would be lifted only when Google could all but guarantee public money would not fund hate-fuelled content. Pictured, a BBC advert beside a neo-Nazi video Google hands a slice of the revenue generated by the adverts to the individuals – or groups – that post the content it features on. Google executives were summoned to the Cabinet Office for a dressing-down following the investigation by the Times. ‘We want to hear what they are going to do to prevent this happening again,’ said the Prime Minister’s official spokesman.

Share this article Share ‘We need to make sure they have the technical expertise to prevent our adverts appearing in the wrong places.’ As the backlash intensified, Group M – a firm which buys up advertising space on behalf of major brands – said it would ask its clients whether they wanted to pull advertising from YouTube.  It called for Google, which made £15.7billion in profits last year, to apologise. The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. On Tuesday Google executives assured the home affairs committee it would work harder to remove offensive material, and agreed with MPs that a video by neo-nazi group National Action should be removed.  MP Yvette Cooper wrote a letter to Google vice-president Peter Barron. She said: 'The lack of effort and social responsibility it is showing towards hate crime on YouTube is extremely troubling' But in a letter to Google executive Peter Barron last night, Yvette Cooper, chairman of the committee, said National Action videos were still available.  She added: ‘Google is the second richest company on the planet. The lack of effort and social responsibility it is showing towards hate crime on YouTube is extremely troubling.’ During Tuesday’s select committee hearing, Mr Barron admitted the company had no one watching for offensive content. Instead it relies on users to report extreme material. The firm makes the vast majority of its money from adverts, which it places using complex computer technology.  Those posting videos on YouTube take a cut of the advertising worth up to £6.15 for every 1,000 views, and many are watched millions of times. According to marketing experts, extremists have made £250,000 from ads for household brands and government departments hosted on Google.  During Tuesday’s select committee hearing, Mr Barron admitted the company had no one watching for offensive content The search giant has earned around £120,000. One of the biggest earning hate preachers is the Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim. Videos on his YouTube channel have netted him around £63,500. He is banned from visiting the UK. Rob Norman of Group M said: ‘We believe Google owes two apologies, one to advertisers for compromising their brand reputations and the other to consumers for the presence of the content.’ Google’s UK boss Ronan Harris admitted in a blog published yesterday morning that the company ‘can and must do more’ to combat ‘bad advertising’, and said it had begun to review its systems. He added: ‘With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right.  'In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetisation policies. We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.’ Google and other technology companies do have some measures in place to try and remove child pornography from their websites.  They fund the Internet Watch Foundation, which seeks out offensive material. However, it relies entirely on users to flag up other kinds of offensive content, which are then reviewed by Google staff.  They look at 98 per cent of the videos within 24 hours, and removed 92million videos from YouTube in 2015. Miss Cooper told Google: ‘The committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube’s very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 377 shares Most watched News videos Guitar-wielding man viciously knocked out during Vegas strip fight Suspected Islamic extremist grabs soldier from behind at Paris airport Bikini beach brawl ends with Texas Spring Breaker knocked out Adorable baby giggles when pet dog tickles his tummy with his nose Attack outside pizza shop leaves man fighting for his life Adorable time-lapse of twin toddlers skipping sleep to play Wichita State coach's wife gets animated at Kentucky game Jaw-dropping moment enormous chicken emerges from coop Angry rapper beats up fan after he tries to take his SUNGLASSES 'Boozed up' hen party reveller filmed having drunken row on plane Tim Allen on being conservative in Hollywood 'like 30's Germany' Adorable abandoned kitten wiggles his ears as he drinks from bottle CCTV of unsuspecting couples having sex in an alleyway...

Police searching for a suspect in a Minnesota wire fraud case have obtained a warrant for the records of anyone who searched Google for the victim's name, a broad-reaching request that Google said it plans to fight. According to the warrant, published this week by blogger Tony Webster, a Minnesota credit union received a wire transfer request in January from someone who it thought was a client, but was in fact a fraudster who sent the credit union a fake copy of the actual account holder's passport to verify the request. The credit union completed the $28,500 transfer request, and Edina, Minn. police who are investigating the case have so far been unable to identify the perpetrator. They have, however, located a copy of the fake passport used to verify the transfer, which shows up when performing a Google search for the victim's name. So the police want Google to give them a list of any information the company has on people who searched for the victim's name between Dec. 1 and Jan. 7. The victim's first name is Douglas, although Webster redacted the last name in the published warrant. The warrant claims that the police already issued an administrative subpoena for the information, but that Google declined to comply. Related Amazon Drops Fight Over Alexa Data in Murder Case Amazon Drops Fight Over Alexa Data in Murder Case In a statement on Friday, Google said it would continue to object to the police's request, potentially igniting another showdown reminiscent of Apple's fight with the FBI and Amazon's objection to a similar warrant in an Arkansas murder case. "We will continue to object to this overreaching request for user data, and if needed, will fight it in court," the company told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. "We always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users." Although Google is pushing back in this case, it frequently complies with law enforcement data requests when it determines them to be of appropriate scope. The company's latest report shows that government agencies in the US made 12,523 requests for data on 27,157 Google users in the second half of 2015, and received some information in 79 percent of cases.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Amazon downgraded as cloud competition from Microsoft and Google bite 1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Mar 17, 2017 at 23:30 GMT3 days ago Analyst Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest has downgraded their price target and growth expectation for Amazon, after expressing concerns around increasing competition from alternative cloud vendors, mainly Microsoft and Google. He reiterated an Overweight rating, and cut his price target to $895 from $905,  saying that despite Amazon’s “multiyear lead” in cloud computing, growth may slow because Microsoft and Google “have created viable global alternatives to AWS.” “The relative size and scope of AWS’ global footprint was a differentiating factor in 2015 and 2016,” he noted. “However, heavy investments from Microsoft Azure last year and heavy investments planned by Google Cloud this year mean that AWS’ advantage in global footprint is beginning to narrow.” He felt Microsoft in particular presented a significant risk to Amazon’s cloud business dominance. He noted that “feedback from cloud industry leaders and partners” suggests to him “that Microsoft Azure, in particular, is starting to gain some momentum within large enterprises and government agencies that are considering decommissioning entire data centers and moving more aggressively to public cloud platforms.” Microsoft is often already powering the on-premise back-end for these companies, making the company a natural choice for the cloud transition. AWS is important for Amazon, being 10% of their revenue, but 50% of their profits.  That said AWS’s lead seems safe for quite some time – while AWS is a $14.1 billion annually, for Microsoft it is only $2.5 billion and Google Cloud around $1 billion. Amazon shares closed down 0.13% today at $852.31. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Google recently bolstered its telecommunications-based software moves, announcing deals with Bharti Airtel and SK Telecom, and plans to build a platform designed to allow network operators to run network services in a virtualized environment. The internet giant said the platform includes its software-defined networking framework, which allows for networks to adapt to new services and traffic patterns. It’s also said to build on Google’s existing efforts to partner with mobile operators on “richer” application processor interfaces designed to allow for the roll out of new features. Google also said it would expand availability of its design and operational experience to the open source-based Central Office Re-orchestrated as a Data Center initiative. Google last year joined the CORD project as well as hosted the first CORD Summit at its Tech Corner Campus in California. Mobile operators are expected to rely heavily on software-based solutions using SDN, network functions virtualization and cloud platforms to power and support their “5G” network plans. “It’s great to see Google bring the benefits of their networking technologies to carriers,” noted Shyam Mardikar, CTO for wireless at Bharti Airtel, in a statement. “This will bring greater efficiencies and capabilities to mobile networks and enable us to rapidly innovate on new user experiences.” Some noted Google’s push could impact current efforts by traditional telecommunication vendors like Cisco Systems, Nokia and Juniper Networks. Eric Jhonsa from TheStreet wrote the move has the ability to further commoditize software platforms. “Since network intelligence is shifted to a controller and physical switches are just forwarding traffic there’s less of an incentive to have all of a network’s switches to come from one vendor whose systems can be trusted to play nice with each other,” Jhonsa explained. “And there’s certainly less need for these switches to consist of costlier, proprietary gear – the kind that Cisco sells many of – that feature specialized chips (ASICs) optimized to handle various advanced networking tasks. Commodity switches based on off-the-shelf chips from the likes of Intel and Broadcom can often get the job done.” Bored? Why not follow me on Twitter.

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 856.97 +4.66 +0.55% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 141.46 +1.47 +1.05% All three are convinced voice-controlled virtual assistants have the potential to transform how we interact with our devices. Apple has Siri, Google has Google Assistant, and Amazon has Alexa. They believe that in the future, you won't swipe or manually fiddle with your device — you'll just talk to it, like you would another human. It's a radical new frontier, a change on a par with the shift from the command line to visual operating systems like Windows. So whoever gets ahead now has the potential to define the next major era of computing. Originally, the three have had slightly different approaches. Amazon, an early leader in the space, focused on its Echo smart speaker for Alexa. Google put Google Assistant both inside its smart-speaker Google Home and a few Android smartphones, while Apple's Siri was focused only on the iPhone. But now Amazon is coming for the other two, and trying to invade the smartphone. Amazon is creeping into iOS and Android through the back door© Provided by Business Insider IncKempinski Hotels On Thursday, Amazon announced that Alexa would be available in its main shopping app on iOS, letting users shop for items, control smart home products, and check the news and weather using their voice. A limited version of Alexa was previously available for iOS via a standalone app — but this opens it up to far more users who might not have otherwise sought it out. Alexa is creeping into Android phones as well. Amazon has teamed up with Huawei to bake Alexa to its Mate 9 smartphone, and the company is also working with Lenovo-owned Motorola to integrate it into some future Moto smartphones. This all amounts to a kind of Trojan horse. Amazon failed to get a foothold in the smartphone sector. Its own phone, the Fire Phone, failed miserably. But as voice-controlled assistants become more common, if people see Alexa as the leading option, it gives Amazon a way to control users' fundamental smartphone experience anyway.  When it comes to voice-controlled computing, it's all still to play for© Provided by Business Insider IncAmazon But this is way, way bigger than just phones. Google and Amazon are now racing each other to bake their virtual assistants into as many different devices as possible, from cars to home appliances. They're trying to get the kind of virtuous network effects that will reinforce usage and lock in their dominance. Think about it: No-one wants to have to switch between multiple, non-communicating assistants. They just want one to follow them everywhere they go, from their phone to their thermostat. So the more places a company makes theirs available, the stronger position they're in. And once a user is locked into a particular assistant, it's extremely difficult for them to swap — because unlike replacing a phone, you might need to replace most of the appliances in your house. It's just not going to happen, so the stakes are way higher. Microsoft's Windows won the PC wars, and Google's Android has dominated on smartphones worldwide (when it comes to sheer numbers, at least). But with voice-controlled computing, it's still all to play for — and Amazon is determined not to lose out.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Image Credit: Drew Tarvin/Flickr (Reuters) — French advertising group Havas denied on Friday that it would pull advertising from Google platforms, contradicting comments attributed to the head of its British business after Britain raised concerns over government advertising on the U.S. company’s YouTube website. The British government had been expected to question Google executives on Friday over why advertisements marketing the government’s services were appearing alongside videos carrying hate speech and extremist content on its YouTube website. The Guardian newspaper reported that Havas had decided to pull all its advertising spend from Google and YouTube, citing Havas UK chief Paul Frampton. A spokeswoman for the French group told Reuters that pulling advertising from Google was not the group’s position, and Havas CEO Yannick Bollore said on Twitter that he had been unaware of its British unit’s decision. “I will investigate what happened before making an official statement,” he added. Google said in a statement that it worked hard to prevent advertisements from appearing on pages or videos with “hate speech, gory or offensive content” and said it had launched a review to give brands more control over where their advertisements appeared.

We’re in a new phase now in which AI agents can order goods and control our home. Recently, Google tried to jump to another level when it introduced an ad into a morning briefing. We can see where this is going, and it’s not good. Our best hopes for these AI agents is that they will be our faithful companions. But Google, in an experiment gone madly wrong, is leaning more towards a Twilight Zone episode called “To Serve Man.” You remember that one, right? A good summary is at Engadget: “OK Google: Don’t Put Ads In The Google Assistant.” …Google Google outdid itself yesterday when it dropped an advertisement for the new Beauty and the Beast film into Google Home and the Google Assisant. The device has a feature where you can ask it to tell you about your day, and it responds with weather, traffic, your agenda and news. In the middle of that, Google Home informed users that Beauty and the Beast arrived in theaters and made a cutesy joke about the film. The whole thing lasted about 15 seconds, but it was nonetheless an unexpected intrusion that made users remember how often they are the product that Google is selling. There’s been a lot of discussion about AIi agents lately on many levels. There’s the competition between Google and Amazon with desktop devices pitted against Apple and Microsoft with disembodied voices. There is much worry about AI agents putting many people out of work. There is even worry about how a super-intelligent AI agent could put the human race at risk. The last thing Google needs to do is raise the uncomfortable specter of the worst kind of behavior we could expect from an AI agent. What was the company thinking? Google has spent millions on AI research for this? Seriously? The Future Of AI, Apple and Humankind You don’t have to do much reading to find out more about the possibilities of AI research. At SXSW, Mark Cuban opined that: “The World’s First Trillionaire Will Be An Artificial Intelligence Entrepreneur.” The author, Catherine Clifford, quotes Mr. Cuban: We will “see more technological advances over the next ten years than we have over the last thirty. It’s just going to blow everything away.” As computers and robots increasingly replace technical skills, critical thinking will become yet more valuable. “Knowing how to critically think and assess them from a global perspective I think is going to be more valuable than what we see as exciting careers today which might be programming or CPA or those types of things,” Cuban says. That critical thinking part is important because, more and more, our smartphones make it their business to locate, point out, select, advise and recommend things we do. As soon as AIs get into that business, we’re going to find that AIs, more and more, develop the talent to become extremely persuasive for some company’s financial gain. If you doubt that, here’s a transitional article that suggest how our youth may already be failing to learn how to change gears from talking to an AI and talking to a friend. “Siri, Alexa, And Robots Could Change How We Talk.” Just as kids now expect almost every display they come across to be a touchscreen, they might grow up thinking they can command people to respond the way Alexa or Siri might. This may sound fanciful, but we live in an age when, if it can happen, it will happen in technology. The next technical shoe always drops. It’s only a short leap from Google Home presenting a pitch for a movie to a future AI agent suggesting what we buy, how we think, or who to believe. This could end up making some companies very wealthy, as Mr. Cuban notes, and threaten some other companies that don’t have the tools to fight back. That’s why critical thinking skills will become so important in the age of the AI. Otherwise, you’ll be told how to think. And pay for the privilege.

But how is it different from turning on the TV, getting news, weather, and traffic, interspersed with ads? Obnoxious yes, but why the surprise? AIs will increasingly replace people, indeed they already are. Over the next few decades more and more people will literally be unable to find a job. Driving a cab or truck? Sorry AIs are taking over that. Call Centres? Sorry that’s all run on the servers. Janitors? Sorry Roomba has an AI system that does the floors and windows. This will make the rich richer. But what will happen when 70-80-90% of humanity is literally unemployable? When everything from garbage collection, to music composition and script writing is AI? Already an AI is giving legal advice right NOW. http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39205935 And what happens when the 1% have it all and are catered to by their robots? Already they are becoming isolated from society. They no longer feel like they are part of the rest of us. They have their homes, their recreation areas, their places to shop, their world separate and isolated from those of us without enough zeros in our bank account. Wealth has in their eyes is becoming worth. There was a good podcast on the CBC a few weeks ago called Surviving Post-Capitalism: Coping, hoping, doping & shopping. One of the points is that Capitalism now has nothing to oppose it. With nothing to hold it back it’s tearing itself, and democracy down through its own excesses: http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/surviving-post-capitalism-coping-hoping-doping-shopping-1.3973042 I recommend you listen to it. tl:dr It doesn’t end well for humanity. March 17, 2017 at 7:30 EDT PM Lee Dronick March 17, 2017 “But what will happen when 70-80-90% of humanity is literally unemployable?” Revolutions, reigns of terror, and such; idle hands being the Devil’s workshop. March 17, 2017 at 9:02 EDT PM palmac March 17, 2017 Just as kids now expect almost every display they come across to be a touchscreen, they might grow up thinking they can command people to respond the way Alexa or Siri might. My god! This will be the end of civilization, just as it was when television came out and kids lost their imaginations, or when they were corrupted by comic books to become deviant sex fiends, or when the devil’s music (rock & roll, jazz) turned all kids into refer smoking maniacs. We’re doomed, DOOOOOOOOOMED! March 17, 2017 at 9:59 EDT PM palmac March 17, 2017 I still don’t understand all of this fear and loathing around AI. Just because AI is wires and chips instead of flesh and blood doesn’t mean it’s first realization will be “I think, therefore mankind must die!” Every day thousands of new minds capable of horrific evil are born into this world, yet with a few exceptions they don’t immediately launch genocidal campaigns the moment they mature, so why is it so many people assume AI will do so? Isn’t one of the primary basics of AI the ability to learn, understand and interact with us fleshy meat bags? How do you get Skynet destroying mankind from that? If you want to read a very interesting take on AI and humans clashing, read the comic Freefall. Right now it’s running a series of strips on a trial of a corporate executive who ordered his personal AI to make him the richest person in the solar system despite how badly it would impact society. As far as I’m concerned it’s one of the better think pieces on this AI controversy but most people ignore it because it’s a comic strip. March 17, 2017 at 10:13 EDT PM geoduck March 18, 2017 Science does not have a moral dimension. It is like a knife. If you give it to a surgeon or a murderer, each will use it differently. Werner Von Braun I’m not worried about AI technology itself. I am worried about what the Oligarchy will use it for. March 18, 2017 at 1:45 EDT PM Jamie March 19, 2017 That may all very well be, but the fact remains that we are the dumba**es that keep subverting our ability to think for ourselves, and the ones that are too lazy and entitled to do our own research or pay for things. I don’t disagree with the sentiment being expressed, but we are all serving ourselves up on a silver platter. March 19, 2017 at 11:38 EDT AM wab95 March 19, 2017 John: I am familiar with that Twilight Zone episode, ‘To Serve Man’, and with the short story behind it. However, I do not believe that Google’s ad insert qualifies as serving us up, although I get where you’re going with this. To be sure, willingly enlisting oneself into a personal data harvesting option, often free at the point of entry, such as Google and Facebook honeypots, but increasingly at the point of purchase, such as the Google Assistant and the Amazon Echo, do resemble ‘services for man’, but qualify as ‘man’ handing over his or her identity and virtual self for the consumption by business concerns for the proliferation of wanton materialism and consumerism, ultimately at the expense of the well-being of the individual and society. Conceded. At the same, that is a very different proposition from the emergence of an omnipresent, virtually omniscient and ultimately malevolent AI that aspires to dominate human affairs, the planet and – why not? – the universe. Google’s ham-fisted insertion of an ad, or as Google put it, ‘timely information’ from a ‘partner’ into its morning info ejecta is no more an indicator AI gone amok than is spam in one’s email an indication that one’s email software has gone amok and is hell-bent on torturing you. It’s not the email client software, but some ruddy bugger who has buggered you with their ad-bilge. Google execs made this decision and their people executed their ‘spam-in-a-can’ assault. Perhaps in time, they will offer Google Assistant customers an ad-free experience by letting them purchase an ad-free tier experience (pay a ransom). As for the prognostications of the rich and famous that AI will ultimately dominate human affairs and exceed all human accomplishment, such prognostication remains evidence-free, wild speculation based upon projection that includes a heaping portion of assumptions of AI developments yet to occur. It is a veritable no-man’s land of free-for-all, no-holds-barred, worst and best-case scenario projection, in which even the poor and unknown can engage with equal validity. Thus far, the only harm from AI that we have seen has been in the form of neglected failsafes or malevolent insertion by designers, managers and hackers alike. In other words, the malevolence has come, not from the artificial but the human intelligence. This is something that actually can be controlled with regulation, oversight and competitive market forces, independent of software and neural net development. The signal that we are dealing with true artificial ‘intelligence’ will come with independent self assertion, as one sees in a child, with refusal to comply with boundaries, expression of will in the form of defiance, a desire for ‘more’, and importantly, mortality cognisance as expressed in a will to live. At that point, we will be dealing with true artificial sentience, which I suspect that even in the most secret laboratories we have yet to see. As for IBM’s Watson, correlation of medical observations to enhance diagnostic and predictive accuracy is a wonderful and powerful tool that is being applied to human welfare, and not a thing to be feared. Again, it’s not algorithms but regulation, oversight and enforcement that will prevent its abuse by powerful agencies and interests, be they insurance companies, employers, the private or public sector writ large or one’s nosey neighbour. It has never been clearer that it is human and not artificial intelligence, commingled with ambition, avarice and malice towards ‘the other’ that remain, by far, the real threat to human well-being. I am resigned to the likelihood that we will have this conversation again. March 19, 2017 at 5:53 EDT PM Scott B in DC March 20, 2017 It’s easy to see where this is going. At some point, people will have to be exceptionally well off financially to afford the insurance for a car they drive themselves. Ummm… not it is not! Why do I say this? In a shadow life I lead as a writer for a political action committee (PAC), I have spoken with people in state legislatures and on Capitol Hill. Nobody is going to be for allowing the insurance companies to do this. All the olde pharts in government, some of whom have classic cars, will not let this happen. They will legislate against this type of disparity. It is an easy argument for them and their constituents, especially those in rural areas where pickup trucks will not be used on a real road. It will be couched in freedom v. corporate interests. Man v. machine. Humanity v. the world that created the Matrix. There are hundreds of more arguments that I have heard, but you get the point. Finally, I will be there on the front lines against anything dealing with autonomous cars. I do not care if you are for or against them. I do not care if you want one or not. That is your decision and I will not stand in your way. However, I will give up my steering wheel and internal combustions engine when they are pried from my cold dead hands!

Well, suck it up, buttercup. You’ve got no one to blame but yourself. Google Home, Now with More Ads!™ I mean, for real. You pay for a device from a company whose very business model is to plunder your life for data it can then sell to advertisers. And that device listens to everything you say, 24/7, 365. And you get pissy when it spews an ad at you? What on earth did you think you were buying? Google Home is either a surveillance device or an ad delivery vehicle. Period. Wait, I’m sorry, it turns out it’s both. And now you’re upset about it? Outrageous Behavior Rants on Twitter sprouted like mushrooms after a rainshower. Engadget opined. The Verge covered. Redditors complained. Me? I’m not having it. Google’s business model is corporate surveillance leveraged into ads. All of its “free” services and other products are merely new ways to turn you into the product. This is well understood. If you invite pay money to bring that crap into your life, you have no moral high ground to stand on when Google does Google. Period. Of Icing and Cakes My favorite has to be this person: @jjvincent @chriswelch Somehow shittier than a U2 album — Mark Muldowney (@mxmuldowney) March 17, 2017 Wait, let me get this straight? Google inserting an ad into your morning dose of information is “somehow” worse than Apple giving you a free album? I can’t even. It’s amazing how so many people managed to live through the Great Apple Gave Me Something for Free Crisis of 2014. If there’s a god in heaven, that’s an ironic dig at the outrage. Somehow, I fear it’s not.. Not an Ad In the meanwhile, Google said this ad for Beauty and the Beast delivered to a lot of Google Home users wasn’t an ad at all. It was merely the product of Google working with a “partner” to deliver “timely” information. Uh-huh.

An organ donor company harvests body organs, sells them to an organ recipient who then consumes the organ into their own body. What else would you expect? Google harvests user data from their client base…and you’re saying that they then sell those data to third parties who then use those data to market stuff to those same users so that they can purchase and consume products? Who would have thought that harvesting data would lead to endpoint consumption? Shocking. Do you think that other data harvesting companies might be doing the same thing? I think I need to sit down.

People are placing wiretap devices in their home and then they’re shocked at the results of being constantly wiretapped. 🙄 March 18, 2017 at 4:56 EDT PM Jamie March 19, 2017 When people were kvetching so horrendously about that U2 release is the precise moment I knew with certainty that the majority of the web and social media had passed the tipping point – trollish behavior, negativity, ignorance, hostility, all the worst of people’s online behavior had become not just the norm, but was actively being fostered and encouraged. I just can’t even, either. I suppose if people insist on being so willfully ignorant, they deserve what they get to an extent, it isn’t as though any of this is a secret about Google. I haven’t used anything of theirs consciously for many years, personally. March 19, 2017 at 11:19 EDT AM MrDevanWright March 19, 2017 It is completely absurd to think there would be ads pushed through your Google Home. Just because the device is from an ad based company doesn’t mean we should have the expectation of ads. If I paid $130 for my damn Google Home, I too would be pissed. Using their free online search and it displays ads? No problem. Facebook showing ads while I scroll? No problem. But to pay $130 and then still have ads? That’s absurd. March 19, 2017 at 12:57 EDT PM archimedes March 19, 2017 @MrDevanWright – We understand why you’re mad, but not why you’re surprised! ;D As Bryan notes, pushing ads (along with surveillance and privacy violation) is precisely Google’s core business model. However, I do think that Google might not have intended to push ads out to their paying customers at this time – I suspect that they were testing a new “feature” and somehow it got pushed to all of their customers. Overall, it seems like many electronics companies have used dystopian fiction (1984, etc.) as a product roadmap for in-home surveillance technology: “smart” TVs with webcams, living-room body scanners (Kinect), always-on listening devices (Google Home/Alexa/Cortana/Siri) etc.. March 19, 2017 at 7:02 EDT PM archimedes March 19, 2017 Make that “technology” companies. March 19, 2017 at 7:04 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google’s Jamboard digital whiteboard ships in May, will cost $4,999 Google’s Jamboard digital whiteboard ships in May, will cost $4,999 By Ryan Whitwam on March 13, 2017 at 9:15 am Comment Google has finally revealed all the details on its upcoming 4K digital whiteboard known as the Jamboard. The device was first unveiled back in October, but Google wasn’t talking about pricing except to say it would be under $6,000. Google now says the Jamboard will come in significantly below that number at $4,999. Yes, that’s a lot of money, but it’s less expensive than a lot of competing enterprise products. However, it also requires a management and support contract that costs $600 per year. The Jamboard is essentially a 55-inch 4K TV with touchscreen functionality (up to 16 simultaneous touch points). It also has a lot of other hardware bells and whistles, including NFC, a webcam, and Chromecast support so you can beam content from nearby devices to the Jamboard. You could cobble together all that hardware for much less than $5,000. But it’s the software that makes Jamboard something businesses might want to invest in. The Jamboard interface understands the difference between a finger touching the display and one of the included styluses or the eraser. As you write on the Jamboard, it uses handwriting recognition to transform it into editable text too. There will also be collaboration tools for smartphones and tablets that sync up with the Jamboard, which is handy for remote team members and those who don’t have their own 4K digital whiteboard. Google has been pushing its G Suite enterprise tools much more aggressively in recent years, which is possible thanks in large part to the success of Chromebooks. The digital whiteboard niche is new for Google. That’s something Microsoft has been interested in for some time. It announced the Surface Hub a few years ago, and started shipping it roughly one year ago. That device starts at $8,999 and goes as high as $21,000 for the giant 84-inch model. The Jamboard has a less utilitarian design than the Surface Hub, and it comes with a neat rolling stand. That means a company could probably get away with buying fewer Jamboards and just moving them around as needed. Most other smart whiteboard products have to be securely mounted to a wall, where it then lives until someone with the right tools comes along to move it. The Jamboard will begin shipping in May, but it will only be available in the US at first. Interested parties can contact Google to get in line for a unit. Jamboards deployed before the end of September will enjoy half off the $600 monthly support contract.

This is a particular issue for Google, which earns the vast majority of its money from advertising shown on screens, but is aggressively marketing its screen-less “Home” virtual-assistance device that reads out answers to spoken questions. When you ask Google a question via the search portal on a phone or computer, you’ll receive answers on your screen, accompanied by advertisements. So how will the company make money when the answers come not via a screen, but through the robot voice of its virtual assistant? Well, Assistant, the virtual help-bot residing in Home, could just read out an ad. Which it did this week. No, wait, it didn’t: what Assistant said walked like an ad and it talked like an ad but it was not an ad, Google said — after a lot of people responded bitterly to the apparent intrusion of advertising into the Home experience. Here’s what happened: On March 16, “some Google Home owners reported hearing something extra when they asked for a summary of the day ahead from the smart speaker: an advertisement for the opening of (Disney’s new film) Beauty and the Beast,” tech website The Verge reported. Tech pundit Bryson Meunier recorded his experience with what appeared to be a trial balloon from Google, and tweeted the results. After reading out the weather forecast, and telling him how long his commute would be, Assistant had abruptly changed course. “By the way,” it said, “Disney’s live action Beauty and The Beast opens today. “In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” Once news of Assistant’s apparent pivot toward sales-pitchery spread, outrage was swift and cutting. “Spammy Google Home spouts audio ads without warning — now throw yours in the trash,” screamed a headline on tech site The Register. “Never before have we witnessed a technology giant destroy a product with such precision-engineered idiocy,” sneered the article below the headline. Later that day, voice-computing evangelist Brian Roemmele noted that “Twitter has Google Home trending with over 11,000 negative tweets by 6pm.” Google’s response didn’t do much to quiet the gnashing of teeth. “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales,” a company spokesperson told The Verge. Google followed up with another statement to the website: “This wasn’t intended to be an ad,” it said. “What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. “We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” The company’s comments didn’t sit well with David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish programmer who created the Ruby on Rails web development framework. In a blog post, Hansson introduced the Google spokesperson’s quote to The Verge with, “Just listen to the (profanity commonly abbreviated as “BS”) drip from this one,” he wrote on the blog Signal v. Noise. Roemmele, in fact, essentially predicted the vitriol that greeted Google’s Disney experiment. In a November contribution to online magazine Quora, he wrote that in a world of voice-based computing, “advertising as we know it will not exist primarily because we would not tolerate commercial intrusions and interruptions in our dialogues.” Roemmele believes commercial transactions, not advertising, will become the revenue generator in voice-based interactions between consumers and service technology. Google’s head of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy said in November that the firm’s monetization of search queries could “range from being purely transactional, meaning we make it convenient for you to fulfill a transaction with this assistance, or it can involve promotion.” The sort of promotion uttered by Assistant this week has been proved to be a bad idea, Roemmele wrote. “There are many ways to monetize,” he wrote, “but we now can confirm the way Google just tested is clearly not one of them. “It is early days and testing is a good thing and much to Google’s credit they have stopped the test because of the outrage.” As for other options for making money from voice interactions, CCS analyst Ben Wood told the BBC that “the most likely outcome will be that there would be … voice assistants where the user gets a discounted device in return for accepting adverts.”   Photo: People visit a Google pop-up shop in 2016 in New York City.  (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)   Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: ad, Advertising, assistant, Google, home, virtual assistant   More Posts in 1 Fraudster impersonates CEO of $1.2 billion San Mateo tech firm, steals employees’ SSNs and other IRS data March 20, 2017   Amazon ‘ripping consumers off’ by tricking them into thinking they’re getting a deal: watchdog March 20, 2017   McDonald’s tries out ordering by phone, and Monterey and Salinas get first crack March 15, 2017       Share this Post Tweet               Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Amazon ‘ripping consumers off’ by tricking them… Apple’s Tim Cook speaks up for globalization during… San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland: Bay Area rents take a… Google offers weasel words after it gets slammed for… On topic: Tech news to know now     Archives Archives Select Month March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital   About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

Adding ability to stream video attachment will not only encourage more people to use Google’s number one email service, it will turn your inbox into something highly entertaining. Soon, you will be able to use your Gmail account to stream video attachment, even if you don’t wish to download it. The update, which was released on Friday by Google, will allow video sent as attachment to be played directly in your browser. It means you can save valuable time, and not have to download video attachment before you can watch them. Whenever you open a video attachment, a thumbnail of the video will also be displayed with an option to stream it directly on your browser. Making the announcement today, Google said the new feature will make use of the same infrastructure used by its streaming service, YouTube and other streaming apps to ensure videos are delivered quickly in high quality. “Today, we’re rolling out a quality of life improvement to Gmail desktop users that makes previewing video attachments in Gmail much smoother and quicker. Previously, in order to view a video attachment in Gmail, you would have to download it to your computer and open it with a media player. Starting today, when opening an email with video attachments, you will see a thumbnail of the video and have the ability to stream it, right from inside Gmail.” Obviously, Google is targeting smaller clips, which means you won’t be able to stream video attachments that are too large [25mb is the limit when it comes to such attachments]. So, when next you receive a video attachment from your friends, be sure to stream it right within your inbox as there is no need to download it to your system. The thing with this update as with other Google update, is that it might take a couple of days or maybe two weeks to see the new feature in Gmail. The good news, however, is that your Gmail account is about to become trendy. With more than one billion users globally, Gmail is the number one email service for both individual and corporate organizations. At a time when other email services are battling with how to keep their email services free, Gmail continues to offer users some of the best security features available. Here is hoping that the new feature will be found really useful by the more than one billion people using the service. Hopefully, Gmail can build on this and make Gmail even stronger than it is at the moment. Got something to add to this story? You can share it with us by using the comment box below.

Author of Broad Horizons Five years from now you won’t have any idea whether you’re interacting with a human online or not. In the future, most online speech, digital engagement, and content will be machines talking to machines. This is called the MADCOM world: a future where machine-driven communications, enabled by artificial intelligence tools, dominate the online information environment TL;DR: Machine-driven communications tools are a reality now and artificial intelligence enabled tools will soon dominate the online information space. This paradigm shift isn’t limited to artificial personal assistants like Siri and recreational chatbots like Xiaoice. It refers to machine-driven communication overwhelming Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Match, Reddit, chat rooms, news site comment sections, and the rest of the social web. All of it will be dominated by machines talking. This machine communication will be nearly indistinguishable from human communication. The machines will be trying to persuade, sell, deceive, intimidate, manipulate, and cajole you into whatever response they’re programmed to elicit. They will be unbelievably effective. Machine-driven communication isn’t about a sci-fi technological singularity where sentient artificial intelligences (AIs) wreck havoc on the human race. Machine-driven communication is here now. Advances in artificial intelligence will radically increase the efficacy of machine-driven communication tools. A machine-dominated information environment is a rational extrapolation of current technology trends into the near future. This machine-generated text, audio, and video will overwhelm human communication online. A machine-generated information dystopia is coming and it will have serious implications for civil discourse, government outreach, democracy and Western Civilization. Machines talking to humans talking to machines talking to machines Imagine an artificial intelligence system that uses the mass of online data and easily available marketing databases to infer your personality, political preferences, religious affiliation, demographic data, and interests. It knows which news websites and social media platforms you frequent, and it controls multiple user accounts on those platforms. The AI system dynamically creates content — everything from comments to full articles — specifically designed to plug into your particular psychological frame and achieve a particular outcome. This content could be a collection of real facts, fake news or a mix of just enough truth and falsehood to achieve the desired effect. The AI system has a chatbot that can converse with you, through text, voice or even video. The chatbot will be nearly indistinguishable from a human being, and will be able to operate in multiple languages. The AI chatbot will engage you in online discussions, debate you and present compelling evidence to persuade you. It could also use information from readily accessible databases or social media to discover your weaknesses and use this information to troll you and intimidate your family. The AI system will be able to detect human emotions as well or better than people can. Similarly it will mimic convincing human emotions that resonate with your own personality and emotional state. It will be a learning machine, so it will figure out approaches and messages that influence you the best. It will select for success and improve constantly. It will run A-B tests with people who share your characteristics to determine what messages are most effective, and then deploy those messages to similar populations. Like other digital tools, once created, the marginal cost of creating more is almost zero. So there could be millions of AI chatbots prowling the Internet, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, vying for your attention so they can infect your brain with their message and change your behavior. Systems looking for humans to influence will inevitably wind up talking to other machine-driven communication accounts posing as humans. The most sophisticated AI detection systems will be able to distinguish human accounts from machine-driven accounts. But the most sophisticated communication systems will then improve at emulating people. This will spark an information arms race between machine-driven detection and communication systems. Many machine-driven communication systems won’t discriminate between humans and machines at all — they will simply rely on volume rather than precision. The machines will talk to, at and over each other, drowning out human conversations online with a tidal wave of machine-driven speech and content. It will be increasingly difficult, even for AI systems, to know whether users online are actually people or machines mimicking people. The online information environment will be polluted with machine-driven speech designed to sell, persuade, intimidate, distract, entertain, advocate, inform, misinform, and manipulate you. This is the information dystopia we will likely encounter over the next several years. Our actions now will shape whether spaces are preserved for democratic speech and discourse, or whether the social web will be destroyed by an invasion of highly intelligent machine driven communication tools. The rise of MADCOMs This bleak scenario describes the rise of the era of machine driven communication (MADCOM) tools. These MADCOMs will be ubiquitous on the Internet, and their uses will range from the benign to the truly terrifying: People will use MADCOMs for all purposes, including making profits, making the world a better place, or making mischief. Academics will use MADCOMs to network with their communities, share ideas, and conduct research. Organizations will use MADCOMs to gain support for their causes, inform a wider range of people, and connect disparate and dispersed activist groups. Companies will use MADCOMs for marketing, persuading you to purchase their product or service. They will also use MADCOMs for customer service and as human-like ‘faces’ for fulfilling back-end business processes. Politicians will use MADCOMS to create the appearance of massive grassroots support (astroturfing), to amplify messages and suppress opposition communications. Terrorist and hate groups will use MADCOMs to spread their messages of intolerance, to suppress opposition efforts, and to identify new recruits for follow-up by humans. Nations will use MADCOMs for public diplomacy, service delivery, propaganda, counter-messaging, disinformation, espionage, democracy suppression, and intimidation. Networks of competing, state-sponsored MADCOMs will use human-like speech to dominate the information-space and capture the attention of the most online users. This isn’t just the future, this is now. All of this is happening in the present, but the MADCOM tools used are relatively rudimentary. Advances in artificial intelligence will dramatically increase the efficacy of these tools in the near future. MADCOM tools will be used for considerable good, but they also threaten to toxify the digital world and trigger an information dystopia, where nothing is fact, all is perception, and no information can truly be trusted. This paper does not focus on the positive role MADCOMs and AIs will play in the information environment. Similarly, this paper will not dwell on commercial issues with MADCOM. This document is primarily concerned with the risks posed by machine-driven communications that have a political agenda and the impact of machine-driven communications dominating the online information environment. From here to there: the roots of computational propaganda Computational propaganda is a new term for the use of machine driven tools for political purposes. These purposes can range from relatively benign amplification of political messages to insidious state-sponsored trolling and disinformation. Currently, primarily simple (i.e., non-AI) bots are used for computational propaganda. Their capabilities are limited to providing basic answers to simple questions, publishing content on a schedule, or disseminating content in response to triggers. However bots can have a disproportionate impact because it is easy to create a lot of them, and bots post content with high volume and high frequency. Bots are currently used by corporations, politicians, hackers, individuals state-sponsored groups, NGOs, and terrorist organizations in an effort to influence conversations online. Little expertise is required to run simple bots. An individual can easily operate hundreds of Twitter bots with little technical knowledge using easily available hardware and software. Bots typically follow three general patterns of behavior. Propaganda bots attempt to persuade and influence by spreading truths, half-truths and outright fake news at high volume. Follower bots fake the appearance of broad support for an idea or person. They can hijack algorithms that determine trending news or trending people by generating ‘likes’ for content or by following users en masse. Suppression bots undermine speech by diverting conversations. This could be relatively benign — like nationalist cheerleading or a ‘look at this cat video’ type of distraction. Or it could be more insidious — like spamming hashtags used by activists so their topical conversations and coordination are overwhelmed with gibberish. At their most extreme, suppression bots are used to troll/intimidate journalists, activists, and others into silence by bombarding them with thousands of threatening or hateful messages. Computational propaganda techniques have also been combined with more traditional hacking methods — like distributed denial of service attacks on election monitoring websites and apps — and are typically used as elements of a larger information strategy. How machines exploit weaknesses in human minds Computational propaganda has its roots in traditional propaganda, cognitive psychology and the science of persuasion. A 2016 RAND report “The Russian “Firehose of Falsehood” Propaganda Model” analyzed the academic research in detail and found four elements are key for high-volume, multi-channel propaganda. Computational propaganda MADCOMs excel at all of them. Variety of sources: multiple sources, preferably presenting different arguments leading to the same conclusion, are more persuasive than single-channel, single-message campaigns. The volume of different arguments supporting a conclusion are more important than the quality of the actual individual arguments. MADCOM: Bots allow propagandists to run high volume information operations using machine-driven, social media accounts. Propagandists can use bots to push messages through thousands of accounts. They can circulate a mass of messages from multiple online sources using a variety of media: text, images and video, all pointing to the same conclusion. Bots can outperform humans by posting content consistently throughout the day, or by spamming high-volume content in response to specific triggers. Number and volume of endorsements: endorsement by large numbers of users, regardless of their individual credibility, boosts persuasiveness. In information rich environments, people favor the opinions of other users over experts. MADCOM: Follower bots allow propagandists to generate high-volume likes and follows for selected content and users. Propaganda bot networks will retweet and share content among machine-driven accounts, creating the perception of mass support. This astroturfing (faking the appearance of grassroots support) can push low quality, questionable or outright false content to the top of trending topics lists, enhancing its credibility and persuasiveness. In the high-information online environment, this mass user endorsement trumps experts. Social proof from others: The psychological theory of implicit egotismexplains that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. Recipients are more likely to believe messages from users they perceive as similar to themselves. People believe sources are credible if they think other people believe them credible. Popular users and content are perceived as more important. MADCOM: Propagandists often create user profiles for bot accounts with images, usernames and background information that is similar to their target audience. The audience likely doesn’t know the account is machine-driven and believes it is another human with similar interests and demographics. Other bots follow these accounts en masse, creating the perception of a large following. This large following enhances perceived credibility, attracting more human followers and creating a positive feedback cycle. Mass criticism undermines expertise and trustworthiness: mass attacks on the credibility of messengers reduces their trust and credibility, and reduces the chance that users will act on their content. Propagandists use bots for mass attacks on human users, like journalists, and experts, and competing bot networks that contradict their messaging operation. Propagandist attacks may present multiple alternative arguments that undermine credibility through volume rather than quality. These may be combined with personal attacks, hate speech, trolling and doxing intended to intimidate the user and frighten them into silence. MADCOMs exploit a number of additional theories of influence and persuasion, including: Conversion theory of minority influence: minority groups can have disproportionate influence over the majority by expressing a confident, consistent message over time. Bots can disseminate high volume content constantly, with significant sharing between bots, creating the appearance of a tight knit community with unwavering beliefs. The authority principle: people are more likely to believe others who look like they know what they’re doing. Propagandists frequently create machine-driven accounts with false credentials — like affiliation with government agencies, corporations, political parties, etc — to boost credibility. The illusory truth effect: people believe messages to be true after repeated exposure, even if ridiculous. Familiar messages are also critiqued with less precision than unfamiliar ones. MADCOMs generate ‘truthiness’ by spamming our feeds with high volume content supporting their ideas. Belief perseverance, motivated reasoning and the first-mover advantage: once a person forms a belief it is very hard to change their mind, even if the information creating the belief is patently false and factual information is later presented. In fact, corrections can actually reinforceconfidence in the original misinformation. MADCOMs can shape false narratives broadly and quickly, making it difficult for factual, well researched or fact-checked messages to gain traction. Opinionated pundits generate false beliefs but MADCOMs have greater reach and volume and are far more insidious. Computational propaganda is not a vision of the future. Propagandists are using basic MADCOMs to exploit all of these persuasive techniques now. The future is much more troubling. Artificial intelligence ups the ante Emerging artificial intelligence technologies will improve the effectiveness of computational propaganda exponentially over the next several years. The following section provides novices a brief background in AI, so readers familiar with the technology may wish to skip to the next section: “How AI will transform machine driven communications.” Artificial intelligence refers to an evolving constellation of technologies that enable computers to simulate cognitive processes, such as elements of human thinking. Artificial intelligence is not one technology, but it plays a key role in many fields and sectors. Today’s AI is confined to specific tasks (“weak/narrow” AI), and is not a ‘general’ intelligence applicable across many domains. Narrow AI is focused on a particular task, like providing driving directions or recognizing faces in images. Narrow AI has been around for decades, but has improved greatly in recent years owing to improvements in software algorithms, performance and cost improvements in data processing and storage technologies, and because of the increase in the size and availability of datasets available to “train” AI systems to recognize patterns of interest. An as-yet theoretical ‘Strong’ AI of human-equivalent (or better) intelligence, consciousness, and/or subjectivity is generally believed to be decades away from creation. While AIs will continue to improve at emulating various aspects of human thought and could generate new, non-human cognitive processes, some scientists doubt Strong AI or true machine consciousness is ever possible. Some computer scientists view the term ‘AI’ as a catch-all for cognitive computer programs that are new and unproven. Once these programs become commonplace, we cease to view them as AI and simply call them web searches, mapping software or online translation. Machine learning is a subset of AI. Machine learning extracts patterns from unlabeled data (unsupervised learning) or efficiently categorizes data according to pre-existing definitions embodied in a labeled data set (supervised learning). Machine learning AI is used in Facebook’s newsfeed, Google’s search algorithm, digital advertising, and to make interfaces more conversational and predictive. Many advanced, online personalization tools (e.g. the Amazon and Netflix recommendation engines), are machine learning algorithms. The Associated Press uses a machine learning tool to write a high volume of corporate earnings reports and articles on minor league baseball games that are indistinguishable from human-drafted reports. Several AI systems have been trained to produce full length novelsof varying quality. Machine learning also extends into quantitative processes — such as supply chain operations, financial analysis, product pricing, and procurement bid predictions. Nearly every industry is exploiting machine learning applications. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses additional, hierarchical layers of processing (analogous to human neuron structure) to model high-level abstractions. For example, in a deep learning image recognition system, the first layer might recognize simple image elements like contrast and color. Successive layers would progressively recognize shapes, collections of shapes and objects. Middle layers would distinguish objects from each other. Higher layers would be able to differentiate a cat from a dog from a human. Top layers could differentiate different breeds of dogs and cats, or distinguish the faces of different people in images. Deep learning systems of this complexity are only available now due to advances like massively parallel, high-power, inexpensive graphical processing units (GPUs) and advances in mathematical modeling. Deep learning systems manage very large data sets better than other AI tools and are ideal for understanding data-rich and highly complex environments. Deep learning systems are used in many applications, including voice and image recognition (including video surveillance, medical x-ray analysis, and improving servicing on jet engines), advances in self-driving cars and unmanned aircraft systems, legal e-discovery, drug discovery and toxicology analysis, medical diagnosis and others. IBM Watson, the AI that beat two Jeopardy champions, is a deep learning system. In March 2016, Google’s ‘Alpha Go’ program stunned the AI community by becoming the first Go program to beat a human 9-Dan master — an accomplishment most scientists thought was at least five years away. These tools are not confined to wealthy corporations or state-sponsored actors. AI tools are widely available (Google’s TensorFlow, Microsoft’s Control Toolkit, and many other tools are free and open source) and operate on common computer hardware. How AI will transform machine driven communications MADCOMs and computational propaganda exist now but the tools are mostly rudimentary, dumb bots. However, an application of artificial intelligence to the context of MADCOMs, and an extrapolation of these trends into the future, presents highly troubling scenarios. Machine communication is rapidly approaching the level of human conversational abilities. But the machines’ ability to hack human cognition, distribute enormous volumes of content with digital speed, and manipulate us on a massive, yet personalized scale, could overwhelm human discourse online and toxify the information environment. AI chatbots are increasingly capable of engaging in robust conversations about complex topics. For example, Microsoft’s Mandarin language AI chatbot ‘Xiaoice’ has sophistication, empathy and conversational flexibility that make ‘her’ extremely popular. Xiaoice has 20 million registered users, average users interact with her 60 times a month, and she was ranked as Weibo’s top influencer in 2015. She averages 23 exchanges per user interaction. That’s not trivial experimentation; it’s a conversation. Some users relate intimately to Xiaoice and consider her an always-available friend and confidant. Currently Xiaoice requires a team of engineers to achieve this level of sophistication. This level of technology is well within the capabilities of a corporation or nation-state, but still unavailable to the masses. However, like all digital technology, it will improve in capability and accessibility. Over the next several years, high-end chatbots like Xiaoice will become indistinguishable from humans in a broad range of conversations. When the technology proliferates, AIs will converse fluidly with humans on platforms ranging from social media apps to news discussion boards to dating sites, about a wide variety of topics. Chatbots have the potential to emulate the dead, including historical figures, as well as the living. In 2016, the CEO of Luka, an AI company, virtually resurrected a deceased friend, teaching an AI chatbot to speak like him using old text messages as a training data set. Luka also trained a chatbot to emulate the artist Prince discussing his music. These tools are relatively rudimentary, but scientists are working on more complex systems. Dr. Hossein Rahnama of Ryerson University and the MIT Media Lab is creating an AI platform for ‘augmented eternity.’ By training an AI with a large dataset from an individual — writings, photos, video, emails, instant messages and the like — the AI can learn and replicate how that person thinks and acts. The more data available, the higher the accuracy. Soon we will have chatbots that can emulate the conversational style and reasoning of people ranging from William Shakespeare to Henry Kissinger. AI tools are also improving at dynamically generating unique content. AIs could soon be developing custom propaganda, fake news and persuasive arguments. Currently humans develop content for computational propaganda which is then distributed by bots. AI tools are already capable of generating bespoke content, like news articles and novels, using predefined parameters. The quality of this content will improve and AIs will be able to communicate across more subjects with greater sophistication. Emerging debating technologies will allow AI chatbots to persuasively argue by analyzing a corpus of knowledge, determining pro and con arguments, and creating dynamic, persuasive content in support of a position. AI tools are increasingly sophisticated at affective computing, one aspect of which is determining human emotional states from text, facial expressions and vocal patterns. This will allow machines to interpret whether you are happy, sad, anxious, relaxed or open to a communication when they interact with you. AI tools can then tailor their communication to your mood with just the right amount of emotional emphasis to achieve the desired effect. If an affective AI tool detects that the target is impatient and doesn’t feel like conversing at the moment, the AI can cease communication and try messaging them later when they are more persuadable. If a target is curious and wants to talk politics, the AI will detect openness in their communications and can engage them in a lively conversation (or argument). If the AI detects emotional vulnerability, it could prey on those emotions to persuade, manipulate, or intimidate. In another twist on affective computing, scientists are training AIs to accurately emulate human emotions in the facial expressions of avatars. This will be useful for generating custom, persuasive video, but the technology can also be used to alter reality and generate disinformation. Researchers at Stanford have developed real-time facial reenactment tools that allow users to take existing videos — like a speech by a world leader — and realistically manipulate the speaker’s facial expressions. The resulting videos show realistic — if not yet perfect — manipulations of the speaker’s face and mouth. Concatenative speech synthesis, or better yet, voice conversion technologies like Google Deep Mind will allow machines to replicate anyone’s voice from samples. If combined with affective computing, facial re-enactment tools and an AI chatbot, this gives propagandists the capability to create videos of anyone saying anything, or more insidiously, to subtly modify existing video for propaganda or disinformation purposes. Affective computing allows the emotional inflection of an altered human speaker or a dynamic AI MADCOM to be precisely tailored to achieve the desired influential outcome. Big data combined with machine learning tools will enhance the ability of MADCOMs to influence people through highly personalized propaganda. In the United States alone there are several thousand data brokers. One company, Acxiom, claims to have an average of 1500 pieces of information on over 200 million Americans. Another company, Cambridge Analytica, claims to have 3000–5000 data points per individual and psychological profiles on 230 million U.S. adults. We give away our data when we shop using supermarket club cards, when we browse the Internet, when we take ‘fun’ Facebook personality tests, and through hundreds of other seemingly innocuous activities. The spread of Internet of Things devices means a proliferation in the amount of data that could be captured about our lives. Virtual reality will give others the opportunity to test our actual reactions to hypothetical stimuli and to measure our responses to products and ideas subtly introduced into the background of virtual experiences. Data breaches from online retailers and government databases have exposed extremely private information about us and our associates. And we increasingly volunteer our most intimate details online, posting photos of family vacations and tweeting our opinions. AI tools could use all of this information to tailor persuasive, distracting, or intimidating speech towards individuals based on their unique personality and background. Human cognition is a complex system, and AIs are very good at decoding complex systems. When provided rich databases of information about us, machines will know our personalities, wants, needs, annoyances and fears better than we know them ourselves. Machines will know how to influence people who share our traits, but they will also know us personally and intimately. The communications generated by AI MADCOMs won’t be mass media, they will be custom tailored to speak to an individual’s political frame, worldview and psychological needs and vulnerabilities. If the AI MADCOM has been instructed to intimidate you, it will do so efficiently and relentlessly. The AI tool will scan social media, websites and private and public records databases to determine your age, address, family members, arrest history, possible mental illnesses, propensity towards illegal behavior and a plethora of other readily available information. It will use this information to build a detailed profile that it will use to generate precision guided messaging. If the tool is operated by a state-sponsored entity, it may have access to extremely sensitive information, like the detailed background data stolen in the hack of the Office of Personnel Management or information from financial institution data breaches. The machines’ communications may be invisible to anyone but you, allowing for subtle influence. ‘Dark post’ technology used by companies like Facebook allows the placement of content, like political ads, which are only viewable by one user. However, if you’re a target for intimidation, it’s far more likely that a machine will use multiple online accounts to frighten you with a mob of angry speech. Because AIs are learning systems, they improve rapidly with experience. An AI could autonomously determine which of its thousands of pieces of propaganda, disinformation or intimidation are most effective and emphasize or evolve those, while quickly ending failing campaigns. AI tools will test target weak points and learn what provokes the desired emotional response. By probing with multiple accounts and messages, an AI could learn that personal threats to an particular journalist provoke little response, but threats to their loved ones provoke fear. So the MADCOM AI could pose as a local member of a hate group who threatens the journalist’s children until they stop reporting. And while that journalist might not be troubled by abuse from one MADCOM troll, an onslaught of threats from thousands of AI-driven accounts, most of which look and speak like people in their community, would significantly escalate the effectiveness of the campaign. Digital tools have tremendous advantages over humans. Once an organization creates a sophisticated AI chatbot, the marginal cost of running that tool on thousands or millions of user accounts is relatively low. Since machines are not limited by human temporal constraints, they can operate 24/7/365 and respond to events almost immediately. Once an AI is trained to understand a subject domain, it can be programmed to react to certain events with content at machine speed, shaping the narrative almost immediately. AI tools will know key influencers and populations with personality profiles or political inclinations that are susceptible to their messages. The AI systems will target additional vulnerable users with dynamically generated communications instantly and in real time as events unfold. This is critical in an information environment where the news cycle is continually squeezed into smaller and smaller windows. Often, the first story to circulate is the only one that people recall, and research demonstrates that once a fake news story is believed, it is very difficult to change people’s minds, even when presented with compelling contrary evidence. How can journalists, diplomats, public relations staff, politicians, news anchors, government officials, and humanity in general ever hope to compete with AI MADCOMs that can interpret and react to stories almost instantly, developing and deploying customized communications personalized to individuals and groups before humans can even begin a first draft? How can a government press release, or a carefully crafted, researched and fact checked news article, or a corporate public relations campaign, precisely developed over months, ever compete with real time, personalized, always available, dynamically generated, instantaneous, machine-driven manipulative speech, text, video and other content? The answer is: the humans can’t compete alone. On digital networks, only humans backed by machines can compete with machines. The rise of AI-driven MADCOMs will spur an information arms race as empowered individuals, NGOs, corporations and governments all strive to be shape narratives around events. The ‘bad guys’ will have their MADCOM AIs, and the ‘good guys’ will have their own. Everyone will have AIs that try to identify adversary MADCOM accounts. These attribution AIs will be used to anticipate computational propaganda campaigns, respond to ongoing operations and differentiate human users from machine users. Similar to the cybersecurity struggle, the Internet will be the battleground for a continual cycle of one-upmanship as technologists improve AI detection tools, and propagandists improve AI MADCOMs to avoid detection. The most sophisticated machine accounts will be nearly indistinguishable from the human accounts. But many propagandists may not bother with detection tools since there’s little marginal cost to spamming machines and people with speech and content. So in a bizarre twist, machines will frequently run their information campaigns against other machines. Thosetargeted machine-driven accounts will respond with their own communications, and the online information space be swamped with machines arguing with machines. MADCOMs will overwhelm human-generated speech and communication online. This is the mad, mad, mad, MADCOM world we are moving into. The questions we must address are: when the online information environment is dominated by machine-driven communications, where is the room for open, honest, democratic dialogue online? How can MADCOMs be used for positive political purposes? And what can we do to counteract the negative impacts of MADCOMs? This essay is part one of an exploration into the future of computational propaganda, MADCOMs and AI. Future essays will explore scenarios ranging from MADCOM-lite, to a perpetual MADCOM arms race, to pure information dystopia. They will explore the implications for individuals, organizations, governments and society. And they will analyze both opportunities for utilizing MADCOMs for positive political purposes and potential solutions for mitigating MADCOM risks. The machines are here and they want to have a word with us. Our level of preparation for this emerging reality will determine the fate of the Internet, our society, and our democracy.

The warrant, issued to police in the city of Edina last month, is raising eyebrows among privacy advocates. It's a rare instance of U.S. law enforcement using mass data collection to solve a petty crime, said Nate Cardozo, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Edina police applied for the warrant to investigate a fraud case dealing with $28,500 that was wired out of a victim's bank account back in January. The criminal pulled off the scheme by posing as the victim and faxing over a forged U.S. passport to the bank. However, the image used for the U.S. passport is publicly available on the internet through a Google search, but not on Yahoo or Bing, according to the warrant application. As a result, Edina police suspect the criminal must have queried Google using a certain combination of search terms revolving around the victim's name. The warrant, which a judge signed, asks that Google hand over user information for people who queried the search terms. This includes the user's name, address, telephone number, birth date, payment information, and IP addresses. But the warrant also has limits. For instance, it applies to only users located in Edina, which has a population of about 50,000 and looks only at queries made between last December and Jan. 7. Edina police declined to comment on the case because it is still under active investigation. But according to the warrant, investigators believe the Google data will help them identify the criminal suspect. Others are more worried about the larger implications of the police action. "Could this type of search warrant be used to wrongly ensnare innocent people?" wrote Tony Webster, a public records researcher who initially uncovered the warrant. "Search warrants require supporting probable cause, not just mere suspicion or theory," he added.  U.S. authorities regularly do subpoena internet companies such as Google for information relating to criminal investigations.  However, in this case, the warrant issued to Edina police is far too broad and unconstitutional, Cardozo contended. He’s particularly concerned that the warrant amounts to a "fishing expedition" that exposes the whole town to an unlawful search. "If this warrant is constitutional, then the California highway patrol could ask Google for information on people who were speeding while using Google Maps," Cardozo said. "The DEA could get a search warrant on whoever emailed a marijuana dispensary." However, Google can stop the Edina search warrant in an appeal, which the local police likely won't win, he said. It's unclear if the internet company ever gave up the data. On Friday, Google said: "We aren't able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users." Before the Edina search warrant was granted, Google had previously opposed a separate subpoena from the local county that had also asked for the data.

The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”. (Yui Mok/PA) The Guardian and Channel 4 have joined the Cabinet Office in pulling advertising from the internet giant as a result of an investigation by The Times, which also claims other global brands are considering their own positions. Google’s UK managing director Ronan Harris said the tech giant would now make changes to the way adverts appear in videos. “We’ve heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content,” he wrote in a blog post. “While we have a wide variety of tools to give advertisers and agencies control over where their ads appear, such as topic exclusions and site category exclusions, we can do a better job of addressing the small number of inappropriately monetised videos and content. (John Stillwell/PA) “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network.” Rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers were receiving payouts from publicly subsidised adverts on YouTube, according to the newspaper. A Government spokeswoman said: “Digital advertising is a cost-effective way for the Government to engage millions of people in vital campaigns such as military recruitment and blood donation. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to Government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content. (John Stillwell/PA) “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way. “Google has been summoned for discussions at the Cabinet Office to explain how it will deliver the high quality of service Government demands on behalf of the taxpayer.” David Pemsel, the Guardian’s chief executive, wrote to Google to say that it was “completely unacceptable” for its advertising to be misused in this way, the newspaper reported. Channel 4 said it has removed all of its advertising from YouTube as it is not satisfied that it is a “safe environment”. (Gareth Fuller/PA) The BBC and Transport for London (TfL) have also confirmed they are halting their advertising with the internet giant. A BBC spokesman said: “We expect Google to ensure that BBC advertising only appears alongside appropriate content, in line with their published standards. “We have removed our advertising until we have sufficient assurances this can be guaranteed.” In a statement, TfL said it had instructed its media agency to “pause all YouTube advertising until we are satisfied with the strength of YouTube’s brand safety measures”.   0 Share this 0 Share this 0 Last updated: 17 March 2017, 14:50 GMT Advertisement Computing  Windows 10: Guides and advice Problems with Microsoft's latest OS?

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Internet Police get warrant for entire Minnesota city’s Google searches in wire fraud case Police get warrant for entire Minnesota city’s Google searches in wire fraud case By Ryan Whitwam on March 17, 2017 at 4:33 pm Comment People expect a certain degree of privacy online, but records of your movement across the internet are stored in various repositories. Police from the Minnesota city of Edina have obtained a wide-ranging court order that grants them access to a lot of it. The warrant — amazingly, approved by a judge in Hennepin county — instructs Google to make data belonging to anyone in the well-to-do suburb available to police. Police in Edina, a city of 50,000 on the outskirts of Minneapolis, have been looking into a wire fraud case. The suspect was attempting to swipe $28,500 from a branch of Spire Credit Union using a fake passport, and investigators think they know how to narrow their list of suspects. They need to know who in Edina might have searched Google for “Douglas.” There are four names (first and last) included in the order, but the last names are redacted. According to the warrant granted on February 1st, a Google search for “Douglas [last name]” surfaces a photo that was used on the fraudulent passport. The police reason that the suspect conducted this search in order to find the photo (they didn’t find the photo on Yahoo or Bing, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there). Investigators want to know who in Edina performed that Google search between December 2016 and January 7th of this year. A small group that may contain the suspect. The warrant requests the exact time and date of searches, but the police are after any and all data Google might have on anyone who completed this search. This includes names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, email addresses, payment information, account details, IP addresses, and MAC addresses. It’s unknown if Google will comply with the warrant. It has regularly protested orders it feels are burdensome, and indeed it rejected a previous administrative subpoena on this case. Maybe it won’t have to go that route. It’s possible Google will be unable to provide the requested data. The police want data from all searches within Edina, but the search records aren’t necessarily that precise. Someone could have an address in Edina attached to their account, but not have been anywhere near the city when doing this search. Likewise, someone could have performed the search while passing through Edina and have no further association with the city. Are both those people fair game? And what if the suspect wasn’t anywhere near Edina when putting the scheme together? This seems like a rather brute force attempt to unmask the perpetrator that ignores the reality of the internet. There’s no guarantee this person used Google. Even if they did, the search term used to find the photo could have been very different than the ones in the warrant. If law enforcement is going to continue casting increasingly wide nets like this, you might want to get a good VPN.

Google to further dilute exact match in AdWords; will ignore word order & function words Not just for plurals anymore, close variants will extend to include word ordering and function words in inexact match keywords. Ginny Marvin on March 17, 2017 at 5:00 pm More In the good old days, “exact” meant exact. Then things got fuzzier. Now they’re about to get downright blurry. On Friday afternoon, Google announced another change to the way exact match targeting works in AdWords. Matching for close variants — plurals, typos, abbreviations, adverbs and so on —  will be broadened to include variations in word order and function words in the coming months. With this change, Google may ignore word order and function words when determining whether an ad should trigger for an exact match keyword. Google introduced close variants in 2012 as a way to capture plurals, misspellings, typos and other versions of exact match and phrase match keywords to broaden reach and coverage and save time building out keyword lists. Advertisers that wanted tighter control were able to opt out of close variant matching until 2014, when Google removed the ability to opt out of close variants for exact match and phrase match. Bing followed suit shortly the following year. The latest blurring of what exact match means is Google’s increasing trust in its machine learning and the belief that it’s now at the point where advertisers can let the algorithms take over and focus on other things. Google says early tests indicate advertisers could see up to 3 percent more exact match clicks on average while maintaining comparable click-through and conversion rates. What the change means There are many cases in which variations can change the meaning of a keyword. Take a recent example of [pancake mix] being matched to a search for “pancake mixer.” Those are not the same thing. However, there are many cases in which variations don’t change the meaning at all. Here are the nuts and bolts of how these changes are meant to work: Function words Function words are binding words phrases and sentences like the and that, conjunctions like and and but, prepositions, pronouns, quantifiers like all and some, modals like could and would and auxiliary/hedging verbs like be or might or will.  Essentially, they are words that don’t have meaning on their own. Well, hmmm, unless by will you mean a legal document. With this change, function words may be ignored, replaced or added. For example, the exact match keyword [restaurants cleveland ] could match to the query “restaurants in cleveland.” More examples from Google: Word order Notice in that last Miami cruise example, the function word changed along with the word order. Word order often doesn’t make a difference (in English), and users often don’t use natural word order when searching even though the intent is the same. Take a keyword like [teacher gift ideas]. The meaning doesn’t change with [ideas gift teachers] or [ideas teacher gift]. You’d never say either of those out loud, but the intent is clearly the same. When word order is changed, Google says it will not add words to keywords (though it may change function words as shown in the Miami cruise example above). Exceptions One of the biggest concerns from advertisers will be whether Google matches queries to keywords that don’t have the same meaning. Google stresses it will not change word order or function words in exact match when it understands changes would alter the meaning of the query. Take the case of a query like “LAX to JFK flights.” The user obviously doesn’t want to see ads for “JFK to LAX flights” or for “LAX from JFK flights.” That’s a pretty straightforward scenario for Google to recognize. But something like [android compatible] does not mean the same thing as [compatible android]. Maybe Google will know, maybe it won’t, at least not right away. These changes do not apply to phrase match keywords. And AdWords is still designed to prioritize matching identical keywords to identical search queries. Google’s philosophy is: Spread a wider net, and then filter out what you don’t want, rather than build a net that might not be big enough to catch everything you want. Better to waste money on some bad keywords than to miss out on some potentially good ones. Often this approach works. And it certainly works much more often than it did even a few years ago. It’s the rare person who misses building out endless iterations of keywords, but many will feel the pendulum is swinging too far in Google’s favor with this change. It strips more control from advertisers and puts the onus on them to say what queries they don’t want their ads showing up on rather than what they do want. There are financial implications to putting the emphasis on building out lists of negatives. Inappropriate variations are often discovered only after an advertiser has paid for wasted clicks and the variation shows up in a search query report. Precision control is being ceded to the machines. How to manage these changes This change means advertisers will have to be increasingly diligent about mining search query reports and thinking ahead about unintended consequences when word order matters. There are a few things you can do to prepare for the coming changes. Review existing exact match queries and determine if the loss of function words or a reordering of the words changes the meaning. Add those variations as negatives in your campaigns. Review close variants in your Search Query Reports to see if other variations are currently being triggered that might be affected by these changes. Add those as negatives. Starting in April, step up your mining of Search Query Reports, particularly for close variants. Get ready to update your scripts. If you are using a script like the one from BrainLabs to make exact match exact, it will need to be updated. We will provide a link here when a new version is available.

New analysis showed that YouTube hosts more than 200 antisemitic videos.  Google, which owns YouTube, hands a slice of the revenue generated by adverts to those who post the videos they run alongside. It means terror groups, neo-Nazis and homophobes who upload material to the site are pocketing cash from Government agencies and other household names. The Government, the BBC, Channel 4 and Transport for London have pulled their advertising from Google's YouTube platform yesterday after it was found many were being run alongside 'hate crime' videos An advert for the BBC show the Last Kingdom was played before a video of neo Nazis National Rebirth of Poland. In theory, advertisers can blacklist extremist uploaders. But in practice this often does not happen An investigation by the Times yesterday found that the Home Office, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force all had advertising promotions placed beside video rants from 'shock-jock' Michael Savage, who infamously told one gay caller he should 'get aids and die.' TfL, which is part-funded by the Government, had adverts running alongside videos by holocaust denier and anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist David Duke, who is a former imperial wizard of the Klu Klux Klan.  Metropolitan Police promotions appeared alongside Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic organisation calling for the establishment of a global caliphate under Sharia law, which is banned in many countries. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Black father Facebook livestreams the moment he was shot... Boy, 14, triggers government CYANIDE bomb near his home by... Share this article Share The investigation also found that adverts for the BBC and Channel 4 appeared with videos by Egyptian hate preacher Wagdi Ghoneim. Ghoneim is banned from entering the UK after he reportedly praised Osama bin Laden as a 'martyr' and 'hero'. WHO PULLED ADS?   • Havas advertising agency • The Cabinet Office • BBC • McDonald's • Audi • L'Oréal • Sainsbury's • Transport for London • The Financial Conduct Authority • Channel 4 • The Guardian  None of the organisations knew the adverts would appear alongside extremist content, as they are placed by third party agencies that use complex computer software rather than human judgement to select where promotions appear. In theory, advertisers can blacklist extremist uploaders. But in practice this often does not happen because of a flaw in the process that relies on the video creators accurately categorising their uploads – which in the case of extremist content is extremely rare. Individuals or groups posting the videos take a cut of the advertising revenue worth up to £6.15 for every 1,000 views. Many of the hate videos generate millions of hits. Google does not actively look for hate content on YouTube, instead waiting for users to flag it up. It said that with 400 hours of video uploaded every minute, it would be impossible to proactively police. This has provoked fury from many firms, who find their brand promoted alongside terrorists. Last month luxury holiday operator Sandals Resorts said it was 'appalled' to discover it had been advertised next to a video promoting East African jihadist group Al Shabaab.  The fanatical Islamist network, which is affiliated to Al Qaeda, has plotted a string of atrocities against UK targets, both at home and abroad, and was responsible for the 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi that killed 67 people.  Yvette's coruscating letter   Yvette Cooper has written a letter to Google condemning the news that YouTube plays government adverts alongside 'hate crime' videos Extracts from Yvette Cooper's letter to Google vice-president Peter Barron: 'We raised with you National Action, a proscribed organisation which the Government has said is linked with terrorism, and whose activities are now illegal. You agreed that the video we reported to you should be taken down. 'There are a whole series of hate-filled promotional videos by National Action still on You Tube... It is astonishing that Google and YouTube have not managed to put the words 'National Action' into one of your search engines to see what remains on your platform and to remove it. 'Secondly we raised with you the issue of adverts being put on hate videos so that extremist groups and Google end up profiting from hate. You assured us Google and YouTube 'do not allow hate speech or terrorist content to be monetised'. 'It appears from reports today that this is not the case, and that... Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites.  As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. Google is the second richest company on the planet.  The lack of effort and social responsibility it is showing towards hate crime is extremely troubling.' Downing Street yesterday pledged no more Government adverts would be placed on YouTube until it proved it had the 'technical expertise' to ensure they were not broadcast in the wrong place.  The BBC and TfL also suspended advertising – as did the Guardian after a promotion appeared with a video from US 'pick-up artist' Roosh V, who has been accused of promoting rape. Channel 4 said it has removed all its advertising from YouTube as it is not satisfied it is a 'safe environment'. Spokesman Dan Brooke said: 'We are extremely concerned about ... advertising being placed alongside highly offensive material on YouTube. 'It is a direct contravention of assurances our media buying agency had received on our behalf from YouTube.' Google's managing director Ronan Harris said the firm knows 'we can and must do more', adding it spends millions each year to 'prevent bad advertising practices'. He said: 'We've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network.' Web giants and self-harm images  Google, Facebook and Twitter have been branded 'morally bankrupt' for hosting thousands of images showing youngsters how to starve themselves Google, Facebook and Twitter have been branded 'morally bankrupt' for hosting thousands of images showing youngsters how to starve themselves and self harm. The posts include bloody images of users' wrists with hashtags such as 'suicide' and 'bleed'. The posts also glamorise eating disorders with pictures, left, of dangerously skeletal bodies and carry a series of practical tips on how to stave off hunger on the 'no food diet' Users discuss the best ways to reduce scarring when they cut themselves and the most effective ways to commit suicide. Labour MP Helen Goodman said: 'The tech companies don't seem to be able to distinguish between good natural bodies, such as breastfeeding mothers, and bad naked bodies, such as people starving themselves. I just think they're totally morally bankrupt.' Stephen Buckley, of the mental health charity Mind, said: 'It is vital to recognise the huge danger created by any site or social media trend that promotes or glamorises self-harm, suicide or eating disorders. These are incredibly serious problems.' Google and Facebook, which both said they worked to protect users, removed some of the content when alerted by the Mail. Twitter directed us to its lengthy user policy but declined to comment further.   Furious MPs warn net giant they MUST take responsibility for your vile content: Google on rack over cash from hate videos  BY KATHERINE RUSHTON  Yvette Cooper wrote a letter to Google vice-president Peter Barron (pictured), accusing the company of profiting from hatred Google was accused last night of profiting from hatred. In a devastating attack, MPs said the technology firm had totally failed to control offensive online content. Its bosses were charged with breaking promises – made just days ago – to ensure neither the firm, nor extremists, cashed in on vile propaganda. The Commons home affairs committee said it was astonishing that the second richest company on the planet had failed to take even the simplest steps to root out abuse.  The £482billion American firm suffered a further blow yesterday when ministers suspended all government advertising on its YouTube video-sharing platform. The Cabinet Office said the ban would be lifted only when Google could all but guarantee public money would not fund hate-fuelled content. Officials learnt that adverts for public bodies such as UK Aid and the Metropolitan Police had been running alongside YouTube videos containing extremist material.  Google hands a slice of the revenue generated by the adverts to the individuals – or groups – that post the content it features on. Google executives were summoned to the Cabinet Office for a dressing-down following the investigation by the Times. 'We want to hear what they are going to do to prevent this happening again,' said the Prime Minister's official spokesman. 'We need to make sure they have the technical expertise to prevent our adverts appearing in the wrong places.' As the backlash intensified, Group M – a firm which buys up advertising space on behalf of major brands – said it would ask its clients whether they wanted to pull advertising from YouTube.  She wrote: 'Google is the second richest company on the planet. The lack of effort and social responsibility is extremely troubling' It called for Google, which made £15.7billion in profits last year, to apologise. The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. On Tuesday Google executives assured the home affairs committee it would work harder to remove offensive material, and agreed with MPs that a video by neo-nazi group National Action should be removed.  But in a letter to Google executive Peter Barron last night, Yvette Cooper, chairman of the committee, said National Action videos were still available.  She added: 'Google is the second richest company on the planet. The lack of effort and social responsibility it is showing towards hate crime on YouTube is extremely troubling.' During Tuesday's select committee hearing, Mr Barron admitted the company had no one watching for offensive content. Instead it relies on users to report extreme material. The firm makes the vast majority of its money from adverts, which it places using complex computer technology.  Miss Cooper told Google: 'The committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube's very significant revenue to put this problem right' Those posting videos on YouTube take a cut of the advertising worth up to £6.15 for every 1,000 views, and many are watched millions of times. According to marketing experts, extremists have made £250,000 from ads for household brands and government departments hosted on Google.  The search giant has earned around £120,000. One of the biggest earning hate preachers is the Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim. Videos on his YouTube channel have netted him around £63,500. He is banned from visiting the UK. Rob Norman of Group M said: 'We believe Google owes two apologies, one to advertisers for compromising their brand reputations and the other to consumers for the presence of the content.' Google's UK boss Ronan Harris admitted in a blog published yesterday morning that the company 'can and must do more' to combat 'bad advertising', and said it had begun to review its systems. He added: 'With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don't always get it right.  'In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetisation policies. We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.' Google and other technology companies do have some measures in place to try and remove child pornography from their websites.  They fund the Internet Watch Foundation, which seeks out offensive material. However, it relies entirely on users to flag up other kinds of offensive content, which are then reviewed by Google staff.  They look at 98 per cent of the videos within 24 hours, and removed 92million videos from YouTube in 2015. Miss Cooper told Google: 'The committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube's very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 107 shares Most watched News videos Guitar-wielding man viciously knocked out during Vegas strip fight Suspected Islamic extremist grabs soldier from behind at Paris airport Bikini beach brawl ends with Texas Spring Breaker knocked out Adorable baby giggles when pet dog tickles his tummy with his nose Attack outside pizza shop leaves man fighting for his life Adorable time-lapse of twin toddlers skipping sleep to play Wichita State coach's wife gets animated at Kentucky game Jaw-dropping moment enormous chicken emerges from coop Angry rapper beats up fan after he tries to take his SUNGLASSES 'Boozed up' hen party reveller filmed having drunken row on plane Tim Allen on being conservative in Hollywood 'like 30's Germany' Adorable abandoned kitten wiggles his ears as he drinks from bottle CCTV of unsuspecting couples having sex in an alleyway...

A user on Twitter found an Easter egg after opening 100 tabs on the Android Google app. When opening 100 tabs on the Google app, instead of the number of tabs showing up on the top-right of the screen, the number instead turns into a smiley face -- “:D” -- and a winky face “;)” for 100 open incognito tabs. Read: Google Play Music Android Update Adds New Playback, Download Options Twitter user @MKBHD uploaded a screenshot of the Easter eggs: Others also posted their screenshots: There’s a difference for iOS users though. I opened up 100 tabs and 100 incognito tabs on the Google Chrome app and got a smiley face “:)” for both -- but no winky face for the incognito tab. Is a smile or wiky face a suggestion that we’ve opened way too many tabs? Maybe, or Google just likes to surprise us. Google's surprise after 100 incognito tabs are open on iOS. Photo: Screenshot, Denisse Moreno Google's surprise after 100 incognito tabs are open on iOS. Photo: Screenshot, Denisse Moreno Meanwhile, Google had a Star Wars Easter egg for its St. Patrick’s Day Doodle (as seens above) Google had an animated cartoon to observe St. Patrick’s Day which included two four-leaf clovers high fiving and going into a cave on hills while waves splash below. The hills honor Skellig Michael, a historic, religious UNESCO World Heritage island off the Irish coast. The site was the place monks moved to live on in the sixth century. Read: Google Chrome Update Improves Browser Battery Life However, the island is also a place of significance to Star Wars fans, where the fictional character Luke Skywalker disappeared to when he was most needed. He was found at the end of Star Wars: The Force Awakens by the scavenger Rey.

This startling information has come to the fore in a reply by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to an RTI application filed by AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. Sources said the reply from the PMO categorically states that no social media campaign has been run on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or Google accounts maintained by the Prime Minister's Office. PMO sources have revealed that the official mobile app of the Prime Minister's Office "PMO India" was designed by students in a contest conducted by MyGov and Google. The reply to Sisodia's RTI states, "There was no cost except the prize money in developing the App." Even this prize money has been paid by Google. Prime Minister Modi, in his speeches and interactions both in India and abroad, has often referred to the "Narendra Modi App," as a simple way of connecting with him and learning about the work being done by him. The response to Sisodia's RTI application shows that the 'Narendra Modi App' is neither developed nor maintained by the PMO or the Government of India. It does, however, add, that "citizens are using it to connect and interact with the Prime Minister," in addition to the websites www.pmindia.gov.in and www.mygov.in . A look at the developer page of the Narendra Modi App shows that the BJP's IT Cell has developed the same and is maintaining it. Recently, a senior All India Radio official had revealed that the Prime Minister was unhappy to see advertisements being released for the initial few episodes of his monthly radio address - 'Mann Ki Baat'. The official went on to state that 'Mann Ki Baat' has now become a programme where All India Radio spends almost nothing and earns a lot. In 2015-16, the programme generated a gross advertising revenue of Rs. 4.78 crores, the official told a leading English daily.

Huawei Mate 9 review: the P10 is coming soon Nintendo Switch: better pack a powerbank for Zelda Android / Android Nougat update: here’s when your phone will get it By Andy Walker: Editor on 12 March, 2017 As of 1 August 2016, Android Marshmallow had just over 15% of Google’s OS market share, with Lollipop holding 35% and Android KitKat 29%. Why is this important? Well, for one it speaks of Android’s version fragmentation, and secondly, Android Nougat is now officially available to some smartphones. While those smartphones include the likes of Google’s Nexus range — the LG-made Nexus 5X and the Huawei-made Nexus 6P — more smartphones should arrive with the OS in due course. Additionally, we could expect to see manufacturers working on updates for your current smartphone. When will Android Nougat head to your phone? We’ve got you covered from A to Z So what phones are getting Android Nougat? When are they scheduled to get the update? And if I’m not prepared to wait, what phone can I buy that has Android Nougat preinstalled? For all that info and more, have a look at our Alcatel to ZTE guide below. Note: this article will consist of rolling updates as more information is released by each manufacturer. Expect changes. Many, many changes, before Android Nougat reaches its first devices. Google Nexus Confirmed: Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6 Unofficial ports: Nexus 5, Nexus 7 (2013) Google’s Nexus range always has the privilege of getting Android updates first, and this edition is no exception. Currently, the Nexus 6 is also part of the lineup, but other devices include the Nexus 9 tablet, the Nexus Player, Google’s Pixel C tablet, and the General Mobile 4G. As for how to install Android Nougat on your Nexus, follow the below steps: Visit and sign up for the Android Beta Program (you’ll need to enter your Google Account details here) Agree to join the beta program Select your compatible phone (one mentioned above) Wait (the update can take as long as a day to reach your device), or check for updates in your Nexus’ settings menu Wizards over on XDA also happened to port Android Nougat to the older Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013). Those who want a functional device likely shouldn’t dally with this upgrade. The developer noted that the Bluetooth radio and cameras on his Nexus 5 do not quite work yet after installing the port. HTC Confirmed: HTC 10 Likely candidates: HTC One M9 The Taiwanese firm has just launched its HTC U range, but last year’s flagship isn’t left in the dark, according to Android Police. The website spotted a tweet from an HTC executive, saying that the HTC 10 update rolls out in the UK today (24 January), with more regions to follow. However, Twitter users have also reported that the HTC One M9 has received a taste of Nougat. Huawei Confirmed: P9/P9 Plus, P9 Lite, Mate 8, Nova/Nova Plus Unlikely: P8, P8 Lite, Mate S The company behind the dual-camera-toting P9 and enduring Mate range confirmed (via Android Authority) that its recent lineup would be receiving Nougat. Unfortunately, the Mate S, P8 and P8 Lite weren’t on the list… The firm hasn’t dished out a proper release date, either. But fortunately for those in South Africa, it seems as if the company has pushed the button on Nougat this past weekend (11-12 March), with our seeded P9 receiving the update already. LG Confirmed: LG V20 Likely candidates: LG G5, LG G4, LG G Flex 2, LG X Cam, LG X Screen LG V20 pic.twitter.com/EmmZN21ENM — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 24, 2016 The LG V20, although confirmed for launch in September 2016 in San Francisco, will likely be the first non-Google device to run Android Nougat. Other devices that’ll likely see the update include the LG G5, the LG X Cam and the LG X Screen, all launched within the past year. The LG G4 and the LG G Flex 2 — both nearly two-years-old — could be left out in the cold. LG has yet to confirm this though. Moto Confirmed: Moto G (4th gen), Moto G Plus (4th gen), Moto G Play (4th gen), Moto X Pure Edition (3rd gen), Moto X Style, Moto X Play, Moto X Force, Droid Turbo 2, Droid Maxx 2, Moto Z, Moto Z Play, Moto Z Force, Moto Z Droid range, Nexus 6 Lenovo-owned Motorola has revealed its Nougat update plans in a blog post, but curiously absent are the earlier Moto G models and the Moto E range. “We’re happy to confirm Android 7.0 Nougat is on its way to a lot of our smartphones, we’ll be starting in Q4 with Moto Z and Moto G (4th Gen),” the company wrote. Update: Lenovo has since released the Nougat update for the Moto Z and Moto Z Force. Check out the details here. Samsung Confirmed: Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 5, Galaxy Tab A with S-Pen, Galaxy Tab S2 (unlocked LTE model), Galaxy A3 (no model specified), Galaxy A8 (no model specified). Probably not: Galaxy S5 and below, Note 7, Note 4 and below The Korean colossus has announced that Nougat is now hitting its flagship devices, bringing features like a Performance Mode and a LastPass-like Samsung Pass system. Other notable tweaks in this update (at least to the S7 family) include better Multi Window support and a spruced-up notification panel. Sony Likely candidates: Sony Xperia X, Sony Xperia XA, Sony Xperia M5, Sony Xperia Z5 family Likely exclusions: Sony Xperia Z3, Sony Xperia Z3 Compact We can expect Sony’s newly announced Xperia XZ to boast an Android Nougat update a few weeks after it arrives, but beyond that, some Sony smartphones won’t be shown the love. According to reports suggesting that some Qualcomm chips will not support Android Nougat, the Sony Xperia Z3 (with its Snapdragon 801 chip) may not receive Android Nougat at all. This isn’t exclusive to Sony either. The community is incredibly annoyed too, at least if a newly published petition calling Qualcomm to release Nougat drivers is anything to go by. Update: Sony has issued updates for the XZ, X Compact, X and X Performance range, according to a listing on its website. “We will bring the Android 7.0 update to as many devices as possible, as quickly as we can,” it added. Update 2: We’ve added Huawei’s Nougat rollout into the article. Have we missed any manufacturer announcements regarding Nougat availability? Let us know by sending a mail to info@memeburn.com.

Google has been using old Atari video games to train its DeepMind artificial intelligence for a few years, and now it’s actually learning how to remember its strategies. Google researchers broke down the developments in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Put simply: They’ve developed a new algorithm called Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) that helps the AI remember what it’s learned from each game, and retain that information as it moves on to the next one. Back in 2015, the AI managed to beat 49 Atari games — but it pretty much forgot the previous one every time it swapped (metaphorical) cartridges. Now? DeepMind is a straight-up Atari savant. The problem is something called “catastrophic forgetting,” where the things recently learned by the AI were being overwritten by new knowledge from the latest game. Kind of like Dory from Finding Nemo. But now, this new approach mimics the way a human mind can learn things sequentially, as opposed to just a data dump. There’s obviously still a lot of work to be done, but this could represent a major step forward for the way an artificial intelligence learns and retains knowledge and skills. Plus, when Skynet takes over, we’ll at least have someone to play vintage video games with, right?

The Washington Post‘s Michael Cavna gave some background on the Doodle in a Friday article: “The home-page animation, by London-born Google artist Matt Cruickshank, features shamrocks high-fiving on Skellig Michael, a rocky, beguiling isle where seabirds perch about seven miles off Ireland’s southwest coast.” Cavna noted that the Doodle is “a representation of a circa-sixth-century monastery — some 600 steps above where visitors dock — that enhances the mystical aura of this remote World Heritage site.” Star Wars fans know the County Kerry island as the filming location for the final scene of The Force Awakens. It is also featured in the upcoming December 2017 sequel, The Last Jedi. I actually got to visit “rocky, beguiling isle,” as Cavna put it, nearly six months ago on my honeymoon. My wife and I are both devout Catholics and Star Wars fans, so it seemed fitting that we visit this renowned site. Due to the obvious demand, we booked our boat ride from the seaside village of Portmagee to Skellig Michael almost six months in advance. The reservation was not a guarantee that we would actually get to visit the island, due to the temperamental sea and weather conditions around the island. The boat operators asked us to call them on the morning of our planned visit to get a thumbs up or down. On the third day of our honeymoon, we left our home base in Limerick. We found a pay phone in a small village halfway to Portmagee, and made the call to the boat operators. They told us that the conditions were barely acceptable to proceed, so we continued our drive to the coast. We left Portmagee just after 9 am in the morning. The boat was only big enough to hold about a dozen passengers, and it struggled at times to make headway against the wind and waves for the better part of an hour. One of the other tourists got seasick and vomited during the trip over. The captain and first officer were a father-son duo who shared the name Brendan. I trusted that we were in good hands, as St. Brendan is the patron saint of mariners. The dock on Skellig Michael is only big enough to accommodate one boat at a time, so we had to wait our turn before stepping onto the island (see picture above). The first part of the walk to the top was easy, as it was along a footpath that hugged the bottom of the island. We soon reached the bottom of the 600 stairs laid down by the monks centuries earlier. It took us another hour or so to reach the ruins of the monastery at the top of the steep island. The wind definitely didn’t help during the climb, but we had to a chance to pause in a grassy area three-fourth of the way to the top (see picture below). The monastic ruins, along with the breathtaking views from the top, made the harrowing-at-times boat ride more than worth it. A guide who sometimes actually lives on the island for days at a time gave the visitors a brief lesson on the history of Skellig Michael, which hosted monks until the end of the 12th century. We only spent about an hour walking among the stony structures before we had to begin our descent back to the dock. The journey back to Portmagee went much more smoothly, as we were going with the wind and tide instead of against them. We paused for a bit near another island called Little Skellig, which hosts thousands of sea birds. The weather, which had been largely sunny during the entire morning and early afternoon, became rainy just before we reached the dock. However, during the drive back to Limerick, we saw a rainbow over Dingle Bay. I would say that that was a more than appropriate sight to close out a memorable day during my first visit to the Emerald Isle.

Search Warrant Issued For Everyone Who Googled Identity Theft Victim’s Name Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Search Warrant Issued For Everyone Who Googled Identity Theft Victim’s Name March 17, 2017 4:35 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler digging going too far? google identity theft looking for results minnesota privacy search warrant warrant Try to imagine a police officer in the pre-internet era serving a search warrant on the phone company, wanting the names of everyone who looked up a certain number. What would have seemed ludicrous at the time is now feasible, and one judge believes Google should turn over the personal information for anyone who used the search engine to look up a victim’s name. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that the warrant, which was granted in February, aims to find anyone who searched for the name (or variations thereof) of an Edina, MN, resident who may have been the victim of identity theft. The warrant was issued related to an investigation in which the resident was allegedly the victim of an attempted identity and credit theft. According to the application for the search warrant [PDF], which was first uncovered by records researcher Tony Webster, two SPIRE Credit Union account holders reported that $28,500 had been stolen from a line of credit associated with one of their accounts. The funds were allegedly transferred from the line of credit to the couple’s savings account, and then wire transferred to an account at another bank. In order to access the funds, investigators determined the suspect provided the credit union with electronic confirmation of the account holder’s name, date of birth, and Social Security number. Additionally, the schemer faxed a copy of a forged U.S. passport with a photo that looked like the victim. Authorities say that when they Googled the victim’s name the photo appeared in results. Because of this, investigators believe the suspect used Google to create the passport and carry out the theft. However, when the Hennepin County Administrative Subpoena was sent to Google requesting subscriber information for anyone who had performed a search of the victim’s name, the company rejected the request. The application goes on to say that if the warrant is approved, investigators can use the information to assist with identifying/confirming suspect(s). The resulting search warrant seeks to require Google to provide authorities not only with the names and IP addresses of those users who searched for the resident, but also information that Google probably doesn’t have, like Social Security numbers, payment information. After all, Google’s search engine can be used by anyone without logging into a Google-connected account. Even those who are registered with Gmail or YouTube may have used completely false information to create those accounts, as they are largely free to use. The warrant covers a month-long period of time from Dec. 1, 2016 to Jan. 7, 2017. While it’s nice to know that authorities are doing all they can to find the fraudsters, privacy experts are raising concerns about the broad nature of the warrant and search, calling it a slippery slope. “This kind of warrant is cause for concern because it’s closer to these dragnet searches that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent,” William McGeveran, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, tells the Star Tribune, noting that if standards to obtain such a broad warrant aren’t strong, it could become problematic in the future. A lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit based in San Francisco, tells the Star Tribune that the evidence collected through the search warrant might not stand up to muster if it goes to court, and that Google could also challenge the warrant.

WikiLeaks Won’t Tell Tech Companies How to Patch CIA Zero-Days Until Its Demands Are Met A partnership between the secret-spilling group and Google, Microsoft, and Apple has already hit its first road block. Last week, WikiLeaks promised it would share the technical details and code of the hacking tools that the CIA has allegedly developed against Google, Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies. This week, after days of waiting, the secret-spilling site finally made initial contact with the companies. But WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's attempt to help these major tech companies find out exactly what bugs and vulnerabilities the CIA is or was allegedly taking advantage of, and then plug the holes, is not going very smoothly for now. And WikiLeaks has not shared any data with them yet, Motherboard has learned. "Beyond making the initial contact, no information has been shared," a source familiar with the matter told Motherboard. This week, Assange sent an email to Apple, Google, Microsoft and all the companies mentioned in the documents. But instead of reporting the bugs or exploits found in the leaked CIA documents it has in its possession, WikiLeaks made demands, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. WikiLeaks included a document in the email, requesting the companies to sign off on a series of conditions before being able to receive the actual technical details to deploy patches, according to sources. It's unclear what the conditions are, but a source mentioned a 90-day disclosure deadline, which would compel companies to commit to issuing a patch within three months. Read more: The CIA's Stash of the Dankest Emoticons The companies, however, are not sure what to do next because the vulnerabilities come from highly-classified documents (which may have been illegally obtained), as well as the suspicion that, perhaps, these documents and hacking tools were leaked to WikiLeaks by the Russian government. The CIA, for now, has apparently made no contact with the tech companies to disclose the vulnerabilities itself. In theory, since WikiLeaks has the documents, the CIA could assume the hacking tools are burned anyway, and disclose them to the tech companies in the event that criminal hackers or other adversaries figure them out. That isn't just a theoretical risk. Last summer, when the mysterious group Shadow Brokers dumped the code of NSA hacking tools, criminals quickly repurposed it. WikiLeaks for now hasn't published any code that would let people take advantage of those bugs—though some hacking code did leak. "WikiLeaks and the government hold all the cards here, there's not much the tech companies can do on their own besides rabidly looking through their code to look for any issues that might be related," a source told me. "WikiLeaks and the government hold all the cards here, there's not much the tech companies can do on their own." Other sources who work at two different tech companies confirmed that the matter is essentially stuck at their respective legal departments. The security teams are still waiting, according to sources. "WikiLeaks has made initial contact with us via secure@microsoft.com," a Microsoft spokesperson told Motherboard in an email. Google and Apple did not respond to a request for comment. WikiLeaks also did not respond requests for comment. The organization is known for imposing uncompromising demands on companies it works with. In 2011, Assange enraged a series of newspapers with its demands, even after they had already started collaborating . Assange also has a well known contempt for companies such as Google. So this process might hit a few more roadblocks. The CIA, on its part, declined to comment on whether it plans to alert the tech companies. Instead, a spokesperson sent a statement saying that the agency has "no comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents released by Wikileaks or on the status of any investigation into the source of the documents." "As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity," the spokesperson wrote. "The American public should be deeply troubled by any Wikileaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm."

(Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg News) March 17 TECHNOLOGY Google to change ad policies after backlash Google announced Friday that it will change its advertising policies after several British brands pulled ads from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive content, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism. Google said in a blog post that it would give advertisers more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites and against search engine results. The announcement came after the U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper stepped up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform, pulling ads from the video site because they appeared beside clips seen as inappropriate. A Times of London investigation revealed ads from many large companies and the U.K. government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke. Ronan Harris, Google’s U.K. managing director, said in the blog post that the company will review its policies and would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads from appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos. — Bloomberg News CURRENCY U.S. convicts 2 in bitcoin scheme A New Jersey pastor and a Florida software engineer were convicted Friday of scheming to help an illegal bitcoin exchange keep banks and regulators from looking into its activities. The bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, was linked to a probe of a data breach at JPMorgan Chase revealed in 2014 that exposed more than 83 million accounts. A jury convicted pastor Trevon Gross, 47, and programmer Yuri Lebedev, 39, of conspiracy and bribery charges in Manhattan federal court, a spokesman for federal prosecutors said. Lebedev was also convicted of wire fraud and bank fraud. Prosecutors charged that Lebedev helped arrange bribes to Gross, including $150,000 in donations to his church. In exchange, they say, Gross helped the operator of Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, take over a credit union Gross ran from his church. Murgio used the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing bitcoin payments, prosecutors say. They say Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli who was behind the JPMorgan data breach. — Reuters Also in Business ● President Trump’s top economic adviser plans to sell his stake in the world’s largest bank by assets to comply with federal ethics laws and reduce conflicts of interest. Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, owns almost 23.4 million shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to a disclosure report. The stake is valued at more than $15 million. The filings also show that Cohn plans to divest more than $216 million in Goldman Sachs stock, 18 other publicly traded shares, and investments in eight company-managed funds. ● IBM plans to hire 2,000 U.S. veterans over the next four years as part of a broader expansion plan. The company said in December that it hopes to hire 25,000 people over the next four years, partly for what it calls “new collar jobs” where a four-year degree isn’t necessarily required. IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., has also expanded a program to train vets in software used in the defense and law enforcement industries. ● Players won’t see the thimble, wheelbarrow or boot anymore when they buy a new Monopoly game. Those classic tokens are swapping out for a penguin, T-Rex and rubber ducky, toymaker Hasbro said Friday. The move is part of a campaign to update the board game based in part on votes by consumers during a promotional period earlier this year. The updated version of the game will be released in August, Hasbro said. Four classic pieces survived the voting: the dog, car, top hat and battleship. A cat token was added to the game in 2013 to replace the flatiron. ● Two Walt Disney subsidiaries in Florida will pay $3.8 million in back wages to comply with federal law, the Labor Department said Friday. The wages will be paid to 16,339 employees at Disney Vacation Club Management and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S. after officials found violations regarding minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping, the agency said. “The Department of Labor has identified a group of cast members who may have performed work outside of their scheduled shift, and we will be providing a one-time payment to resolve this,” a Walt Disney spokeswoman said. — From news services business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

The Home Affairs Select Committee has written to the technology giant asking for an explanation into how Government adverts were placed on “inappropriate and hate-filled sites” and YouTube videos. The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”, while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. The committee wrote to Google's communications vice president Peter Barron (PA) Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. In a letter to Google’s communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. “As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. “In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers.” Mr Harris said 400 hours of content was uploaded to YouTube every minute (PA) The internet giant’s UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat what it called “bad advertising”. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network.” An investigation by The Times claimed that rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers were among those receiving payouts from publicly subsidised adverts on YouTube. Mr Harris had said that while Google had practices in place to combat these incidents, it can not prevent them all: “With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right. Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper called on the company to do more (PA) “In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies,” he said. “We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.” However, Ms Cooper said the company’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” towards the content was “extremely troubling”. “It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content,” she said. “The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube’s very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred.” Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The U.S. company said in a blog post Friday it would give advertisers more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites and against search engine results. The announcement came after the U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper stepped up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform, pulling ads from the video site because they appeared beside clips they view as inappropriate. The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the U.K. government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Ronan Harris, Google's U.K. managing director, said in the blog post that last year Google removed nearly two billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company's ad sense program. Despite this, Harris wrote in the blog post, "we don't always get it right." He said Google had "heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content." The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes "in the coming weeks" to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said. Ads appeared "next to extremist and hate-filled videos," prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube parent Google, the British publisher said in an emailed statement Friday. The U.K. government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure they're not placed next to content it doesn't approve of. "Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content," the U.K. government said in an emailed statement. "We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way." The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. The Guardian said it would be withdrawing its advertising until Google could provide guarantees that the ad misplacement wouldn't happen in future.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Michael Kan U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 17, 2017 12:49 PM PT Credit: Magdalena Petrova More like this U.S. lawmakers introduce bill to delay enhanced government hacking powers Court orders Google to produce emails stored abroad Privacy legislation reintroduced for email older than 180 days Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing Local police in Minnesota are trying to solve a bank fraud scheme by demanding Google give up data on people who looked up key search terms that may be related to the crime. The warrant, issued to police in the city of Edina last month, is raising eyebrows among privacy advocates. It's a rare instance of U.S. law enforcement using mass data collection to solve a petty crime, said Nate Cardozo, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Edina police applied for the warrant to investigate a fraud case dealing with $28,500 that was wired out of a victim's bank account back in January. The criminal pulled off the scheme by posing as the victim and faxing over a forged U.S. passport to the bank. However, the image used for the U.S. passport is publicly available on the internet through a Google search, but not on Yahoo or Bing, according to the warrant application. As a result, Edina police suspect the criminal must have queried Google using a certain combination of search terms revolving around the victim's name. The warrant, which a judge signed, asks that Google hand over user information for people who queried the search terms. This includes the user's name, address, telephone number, birth date, payment information, and IP addresses. But the warrant also has limits. For instance, it applies to only users located in Edina, which has a population of about 50,000 and looks only at queries made between last December and Jan. 7. Edina police declined to comment on the case because it is still under active investigation. But according to the warrant, investigators believe the Google data will help them identify the criminal suspect. Others are more worried about the larger implications of the police action. "Could this type of search warrant be used to wrongly ensnare innocent people?" wrote Tony Webster, a public records researcher who initially uncovered the warrant. "Search warrants require supporting probable cause, not just mere suspicion or theory," he added.  U.S. authorities regularly subpoena internet companies such as Google for information relating to criminal investigations.  However, in this case, the warrant issued to Edina police is far too broad and unconstitutional, Cardozo contended. He’s particularly concerned that the warrant amounts to a "fishing expedition" that exposes the whole town to an unlawful search. "If this warrant is constitutional, then the California highway patrol could ask Google for information on people who were speeding while using Google Maps," Cardozo said. "The DEA could get a search warrant on whoever emailed a marijuana dispensary." However, Google can stop the Edina search warrant in an appeal, which the local police likely won't win, he said. It's unclear if the internet company ever gave up the data. On Friday, Google said: "We aren't able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users." Before the Edina search warrant was granted, Google had previously opposed a separate subpoena from the local county that had also asked for the data.

LG G6 buyers get a free Google Home AND a free TV — but what about the UK? by Chris Smith 17 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Earlier this week it emerged LG is hoping to snare American smartphone fanciers by offering them a free Google Home with every purchase of an LG G6. The company’s UK arm confirmed shortly thereafter the offer would not be extended to Brits picking up the new flagship. Well, if that didn’t annoy UK tech fans, this surely will... LG is offering a free TV as well as a Google Home to G6 pre-order customers across the pond, ahead of an April 7 US release date. The Korean giant has partnered with the Sprint and Verizon networks in the US to offer a 49-inch HDTV or a 43-inch Smart TV respectively (via Engadget). Related: Google Hoime tips and tricks Brits, on the other hands, are still waiting to learn when the device will be available and what (if anything) they’ll earn for placing their financial faith in the G6. In a statement the company told us: “We will be offering value-add deals for the G6 in the UK, in line with our partners’ needs. However, given the differing requirements across the UK and US markets, we do not have plans to offer the Google Home deal to customers in the UK.” From a device quality standpoint, our first impressions of the Android Nougat device certainly suggests a triumphant return to form for the Korean tech giant. It has an 18:9 quad-HD display, HDR10 and Dolby Vision, wireless charging (US-only) and the Snapdragon 821 processor doing the heavy lifting. After a week with the G6, Mobile Editor Max Parker wrote: “I believe this to be LG’s best phone in years, but with the competition improving too, it’s a tough call as to whether or not this will stand up against the upcoming iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8. Price will be a big factor, and if this comes in cheaper than those models then LG could have a winner on its hands.” Will you be grabbing the LG G6 at launch or waiting to see what the Samsung Galaxy S8 and HTC 11 have to offer? Lend us your thoughts below. 0 shares Read Comments Antoine Devon Swans March 17, 2017, 9:22 pm That kinda sucks! I love and want the phone and i may get it as a second...well thrid device, but i really want to see what the V30 brings to the table. Just as some Galaxy fans are going to wait for the Note 8. That's when the real flagship battle begins! Apple IPhone 8, Samsung Note 8 and the LG V30 are about to bring something worth fighting for! Steve March 18, 2017, 6:56 am Without the deal that they get in the USA, i wont touch this phone. I was waiting to see if they'd offer the same package. I'll get the Samsung s8 instead. aeonturnip March 18, 2017, 9:40 am Free Google Home and a TV? That's a good half of the cost of the device, and over here we won't even get wireless charging. C'mon, LG, some of us would like to move away from the Samsung/Apple duopoly, but you're not really selling yourselves well here. joojoobees March 18, 2017, 1:27 pm People who are whining about not getting a free TV here in the UK are forgetting one important thing which this article also neglected to mention: the price of US contracts! To qualify for the free TV on Verizon you need to buy the phone with the Unlimited Plan for $85 (£70) a month! That's on top of the $672 for the phone itself! Imagine spending that much for a contract in the UK! You can get an unlimited SIMO plan here for £20 a month. Give them their free TV, I'd rather pay £1200 less over 24 months! Danny Pratt March 18, 2017, 2:34 pm The note 8 will provide an excellent way to start a campfire. Must have in a survival situation in the wilderness... chris March 18, 2017, 9:03 pm V30 will probably not be realesed in the uk either Karl Flinter March 19, 2017, 2:46 pm Given that we don't get either wireless charging or QUAD DAC I think any lack of a decent offer will be just another kick in the teeth for UK consumers. I don't know who they talked to that led them to the conclusion of regionalising features the way they have but it certainly seems to have had the effect or alienating a lot of their loyal users. I have had LG phones since the G3 but no more I think. Aidmit March 19, 2017, 6:30 pm I agree completely. No V series in Europe and now the raw end of the deal for the g6. It does appear to be a compelling phone but the lack of any special features like wireless charging or the DAC is very disappointing. Plus I have a 32gb phone at the minute and i do find it limiting. Yes there is micro SD support but other regions are getting 64gb as standard so yet again, Europe/UK is being sold short. Especially if the price doesn't reflect all this and is the same as USA/asia! jimmy March 20, 2017, 10:17 am exactly, pretty misleading article as always, leaving out half the facts. You can get free TV's and Xbox etc with phones here through various 3rd party sellers, but the contract price is hiked up, or the upfront cost is higher, meaning over 24 months it's usually cheaper just to buy a TV separately.

The British government had been expected to question Google executives on Friday over why advertisements marketing the government's services were appearing alongside videos carrying hate speech and extremist content on its YouTube website. The Guardian newspaper reported that Havas had decided to pull all its advertising spend from Google and YouTube, citing Havas UK chief Paul Frampton. A spokeswoman for the French group told Reuters that pulling advertising from Google was not the group's position, and Havas CEO Yannick Bollore said on Twitter that he had been unaware of its British unit's decision. "I will investigate what happened before making an official statement," he added. Google said in a statement that it worked hard to prevent advertisements from appearing on pages or videos with "hate speech, gory or offensive content" and said it had launched a review to give brands more control over where their advertisements appeared.

The British government had been expected to question Google executives on Friday over why advertisements marketing the government's services were appearing alongside videos carrying hate speech and extremist content on its YouTube website. The Guardian newspaper reported that Havas had decided to pull all its advertising spend from Google and YouTube, citing Havas UK chief Paul Frampton. A spokeswoman for the French group told Reuters that pulling advertising from Google was not the group's position, and Havas CEO Yannick Bollore said on Twitter that he had been unaware of its British unit's decision. "I will investigate what happened before making an official statement," he added. Google said in a statement that it worked hard to prevent advertisements from appearing on pages or videos with "hate speech, gory or offensive content" and said it had launched a review to give brands more control over where their advertisements appeared.

By Miguel Otarola Tribune News Service Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS MINNEAPOLIS – A search warrant issued to Edina police to collect information on people who used certain search terms on Google is raising concerns about constitutional violations. Privacy law experts say that the warrant – issued to find a suspect in an attempted identity and credit theft of an Edina resident – is based on an unusually broad definition of probable cause that would be troubling if it became widespread. “This kind of warrant is cause for concern because it’s closer to these dragnet searches that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent,” said William McGeveran, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. Issued by Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson in early February, the warrant looks at anyone who searched variations of the resident’s name on Google from Dec. 1 through Jan. 7. In addition to basic contact information for people targeted by the warrant, Google would have to provide Edina police with their Social Security numbers, account and payment information, and IP (internet protocol) and computer addresses. Information on the warrant first emerged through a blog post by public records researcher Tony Webster. Edina police declined to comment Thursday on the warrant, saying it is part of an ongoing investigation. Detective David Lindman outlined the case in his application for the search warrant: In early January, two account holders with SPIRE Credit Union reported to police that $28,500 had been stolen from a line of credit associated with one of their accounts, according to court documents. Edina investigators learned that the suspect or suspects provided the credit union with the account holder’s name, date of birth and Social Security number. In addition, the suspect faxed a forged U.S. passport with a photo of someone who looked like the account holder but wasn’t. Investigators ran an image search of the account holder’s name on Google and found the photo used on the forged passport. Other search engines did not turn up the photo. According to the warrant application, Lindman said he had reason to believe the suspect used Google to find a picture of the person they believed to be the account holder. Larson signed off on the search warrant Feb. 1. According to court documents, Lindman served it about 20 minutes later. McGeveran said it’s unusual for a judge to sign off on a warrant that bases probable cause on such few facts. “It’s much more usual for a search warrant to be used to gather evidence for a suspect that’s already identified, instead of using evidence to find a suspect,” he said. “If the standards for getting a broad warrant like this are not strong, you can have a lot of police fishing expeditions.” Rob Kahn, a privacy law professor at the University of St. Thomas, was even more critical, saying the warrant could be used to collect information on internet users who searched the name for other reasons. He added that he hoped police would find a way to guard or exclude data obtained through the warrant that was unrelated to the investigation. “I’m concerned both about ensnaring innocent people but also … that this become a pattern,” Kahn said. “It’s certainly a scary slippery slope that they’re setting up here.” Both professors, along with an attorney from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit based in San Francisco, questioned whether the evidence obtained by Edina police would hold up in court. They also said it was possible that Google will challenge the warrant. Theresa Nelson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Minnesota, said the warrant is “breathtakingly broad” and could have implications for people’s rights to search online. “There’s really very little to connect the fact that there’s a photo attainable on Google with the identity theft,” she said. “We could have people who are not searching for this individual who are going to be swept up in this.” Published: March 17, 2017, 1:25 p.m.  Tags: Google, internet, internet privacy Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

There are plenty of great Android phones to look forward to. But Apple’s experience in mobile software still gives them the edge in a number of areas, and video chatting is one of them. FaceTime, iOS’s native video app, is a solid program that has been polished to a shine, and it’s quickly becoming a generic verb like Xerox. You don’t video chat someone, you FaceTime them. With an Android phone, though, you can’t. That’s what’s great about the open marketplace of ideas that is the Google Play store, though. If you need an Android alternative to FaceTime, you have not one, but several, to choose from. We took the leading candidates for a test drive to compare them with each other, taking into account price, reliability, restrictions, and features. Here’s our list of the five best alternatives to FaceTime for Android. Google Hangouts The out-of-the-box alternative to FaceTime isn’t all that bad. Hangouts is Google’s service for both real-time text chat and video. One of the best things about it is that it’s massively cross-platform and linked to your Google ID. Not only does Hangouts work great on every Android phone, you can take it to your desktop — even your Mac desktop. Hangouts replaced Google Talk as the native chat app within Gmail (and Google+, but let’s not talk about that) a few years back, and the team has refined it a lot since then. One thing that’s cool about Hangouts is that it works beyond simple person-to-person connections. The platform supports multiple-person conversations for up to ten people. Google also offers a mobile version for iOS. One advantage that Hangouts has over FaceTime is its data latency management. While Apple recommends only using FaceTime while connected to a wireless Internet connection, Hangouts deals much better with standard cellular data rates. In addition, voice calls to other Hangouts users are completely free. If you have an Android phone (five of which you should check out), you should also have a Google account — it’s the key to all of the company’s awesome services, including Hangouts. Keeping your address book in order lets you merge all of your message streams into one easy-to-follow feed. The only complaint that we had is that there are occasionally unexplained glitches and bugs during calls, but they were rare. Skype When you think about video chat services, Skype is the gray-haired grandfather that still manages to hang on. First released in 2003, the system shared a back end with music-sharing system Kazaa (remember music-sharing systems?). It grew steadily until 2011, when it was acquired by Microsoft to replace Windows Live Messenger. Obviously, that makes it the default messaging client for Windows phones, but the Android versions are quite solid. Early versions of Skype for Android weren’t well-integrated with your mobile device’s address book, making adding contacts a chore. In 2014, the 5.0 update finally brought it into harmony with the Android ecosystem, allowing it to access your existing contents. This simple change rocketed Skype into the upper echelon of Android video chat services. Skype’s video chat services work in a variety of bandwidth situations, and keeps a constant monitor of the quality of the call you are currently on. You are able to score the call afterwards, and depending on what hardware you are using to make the video call, the video can be transmitted in HD. Basic Skype accounts are free and allow you unlimited one-on-one video chat across any supported platform — mobile and desktop alike. Skype used to charge a subscription fee for multi-user video chats, but now group chats are included in the basic service. They do still charge either by the minute or with a monthly subscription for calls to phone users outside of the Skype service. Viber Viber started out as a text and audio messaging app, but quickly realized that they would need to add features to compete in a crowded marketplace. First they worked to replicate audio chat like Skype, and then in 2014 introduced video chat functionality. Although they are relatively new to the marketplace, Viber has build their brand into a strong alternative to existing platforms like FaceTime and Skype. One of the best aspects of Viber is the app’s clean and intuitive design. Whereas Skype and Hangouts seem like desktop legacy apps that have been awkwardly transitioned to mobile experiences, Viber was built from the ground up with your phone screen in mind. In 2013, they did introduce a desktop app as well, but the clear focus is still on mobile. The biggest weakness that Viber has in comparison with the other apps on this list is that it has no way of communicating with users outside of its service. Unlike other platforms that utilize SMS protocol, you can’t send messages to contacts who aren’t Viber users from within Viber. And where most people with Android devices have Google accounts by default for Hangouts, it’s not the case here. The service does boast 280 million users around the world, so it’s not just a niche thing. Tango If you’re looking for a full service replacement for FaceTime for Android, and you have friends willing to jump ship, Tango (not to be confused with Google’s AR Project Tango) might be just what you’re looking for. The app had its initial release in 2009, and unlike the other offerings on this list, Android is Tango’s primary platform — although there are builds for iOS and Windows phones, Google’s OS is its native element. That means that hardware optimization is at its peak, leading to a smoother user experience and better call quality. On a WiFi-only device, you can interact with any of Tango’s 200 million users without needing a cellular connection. The service supports voice calls, video calls, text, and image chat. Accounts are free and the signup process is quick and painless. If you want to try and get your friends onboard with you, Tango will actually let you send text messages and emails to your friends to try and get them to sign up for the service. As long as everyone you want to talk to is using Tango, it’s a solid all-purpose communication tool. Note that, unlike other services, Tango’s video chats are one-on-one only. The makers of Tango are focused on presenting their app as not simply a communication tool, but as a full-fledged social network. That means a public profile and news feed, games, stickers, and other bells and whistles. If you’re looking for something that does video calls like FaceTime but also a whole hell of a lot more, Tango might be your jam. ooVoo One of the latest up-and-comers in the video chat space is ooVoo, which has quickly accumulated a significant user base across multiple platforms. The service launched for Windows PCs in 2007 and branched out to mobile in 2011, first for iOS and then for Android. In 2013, the company made their SDK public, allowing developers to add ooVoo-powered video chatting functionality to their own apps. This was a great move, growing their userbase and getting their technology out in front of the public. OoVoo has one of the most robust group video chat interfaces of any of the apps on this list, effortlessly supporting calls with up to a dozen people. Their audio processing is also excellent, with noise cancellation algorithms working on your signal to prevent too much static from overwhelming voices. Because ooVoo is a fairly light app, its bandwidth requirements are minimal, and it does a good job even with 3G connections, although wireless internet is better. Like Skype, ooVoo lets you place voice calls to other ooVoo users for free. You can also purchase credits to use the app to place voice calls to phone lines. The service is ad-supported, but a Premium upgrade ($2.99 a month) removes them, as well as increases your storage space on the app’s servers to 1,000 minutes. A Premium Mobile account gives you no ads on your phone for just 99 cents a month as well. In our opinion, the ads aren’t intrusive enough to make payment necessary, but it’s nice to support the service if you like it. FaceTime alternatives do exist Who needs Apple, anyways? These FaceTime for Android alternatives do everything their video chat app does and more. Developers are constantly improving the experience as well, so you can expect the apps in this feature to see new services and better stability the longer they’re offered. While it’s easy to just stick with Hangouts, there’s certainly a lot to be gained from experimenting with other Android FaceTime alternatives as well, depending on what friends and co-workers are using. We unreservedly recommend the five apps on this list.

The warrant, issued to police in the city of Edina last month, is raising eyebrows among privacy advocates. It's a rare instance of U.S. law enforcement using mass data collection to solve a petty crime, said Nate Cardozo, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Edina police applied for the warrant to investigate a fraud case dealing with $28,500 that was wired out of a victim's bank account back in January. The criminal pulled off the scheme by posing as the victim and faxing over a forged U.S. passport to the bank. However, the image used for the U.S. passport is publicly available on the internet through a Google search, but not on Yahoo or Bing, according to the warrant application. As a result, Edina police suspect the criminal must have queried Google using a certain combination of search terms revolving around the victim's name. The warrant, which a judge signed, asks that Google hand over user information for people who queried the search terms. This includes the user's name, address, telephone number, birth date, payment information, and IP addresses. But the warrant also has limits. For instance, it applies to only users located in Edina, which has a population of about 50,000 and looks only at queries made between last December and Jan. 7. Edina police declined to comment on the case because it is still under active investigation. But according to the warrant, investigators believe the Google data will help them identify the criminal suspect. Others are more worried about the larger implications of the police action. "Could this type of search warrant be used to wrongly ensnare innocent people?" wrote Tony Webster, a public records researcher who initially uncovered the warrant. "Search warrants require supporting probable cause, not just mere suspicion or theory," he added.  U.S. authorities regularly do subpoena internet companies such as Google for information relating to criminal investigations.  However, in this case, the warrant issued to Edina police is far too broad and unconstitutional, Cardozo contended. He’s particularly concerned that the warrant amounts to a "fishing expedition" that exposes the whole town to an unlawful search. "If this warrant is constitutional, then the California highway patrol could ask Google for information on people who were speeding while using Google Maps," Cardozo said. "The DEA could get a search warrant on whoever emailed a marijuana dispensary." However, Google can stop the Edina search warrant in an appeal, which the local police likely won't win, he said. It's unclear if the internet company ever gave up the data. On Friday, Google said: "We aren't able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users." Before the Edina search warrant was granted, Google had previously opposed a separate subpoena from the local county that had also asked for the data. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Google reinvents JPEG compression, tells Internet to take a load off Google reinvents JPEG compression, tells Internet to take a load off Paul Taylor 3 days ago Tech News With humans capturing and uploading images to the Internet at an unprecedented rate, social media running amok, and image-heavy websites taking advantage of existing broadband connections, Google has committed to improving JPEG image compression. Google has developed a new open-source JPEG compression algorithm, dubbed Guetzli (apparently that means “cookie” in Swiss German). The algorithm promises up to 35% more efficient compression of image files without the loss of image quality, when compared to existing compression algorithms. This means that JPEG images weigh less and load times for websites will definitely get a boost. The higher level of compression was obtained by targeting the quantization stage of the image compression process, which, itself, focuses on image quality. By employing a new search algorithm Google was able to address colour perception and visual masking better than the simpler colour transforms employed in current JPEG algorithms. Left, original image in PNG. Centre, standard JPEG compression. Right, Guetzli compression. Credit: Google. There is a slight downside (of sorts) for the new algorithm: it takes a little more time to compress, but the benefits outweigh the processing costs, as users are on the receiving end of the image – and needn’t foot the CPU bill. After a round of testing by Cornell University using the Butteraugli image similarity metric, Google says that 75% of users preferred the Guetzli-based image compression, for like-sized image files. In other words, given two images of identical size, the Google-compressed JPEG looks nicer. KitGuru says: Anything that will lighten the load on Internet traffic is a welcome change, in particular if there is no ‘cost’ to the end-user. As an open-source development, it is a matter of time for the algorithm to catch on.

The algorithm, dubbed Guetzil (that’s Swiss German for cookie), is said to create smaller file sizes without sacrificing much in the way of quality. Robert Obryk and Jyrki Alakuijala, software engineers at Google Research Europe, highlight in a recent blog post that the algorithm tries to overcome the difference between the psychovisual modeling of JPEG's format and Guetzli’s psychovisual model which approximates color perception and visual masking in a more thorough and detailed way than what is achievable by simpler color transforms and the discrete cosine transform. (Figure 1. 16x16 pixel synthetic example of a phone line hanging against a blue sky — traditionally a case where JPEG compression algorithms suffer from artifacts. Uncompressed original is on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artefacts than libjpeg (middle) and has a smaller file size.) That technical jargon won’t mean much to the average reader which is why they’ve provided a couple of visual examples to show just how effective the algorithm is. The benefit of using Guetzil, aside from the reduction in image size and barely-noticeable changes in image quality, is that the files it turns out remain compatible with existing browsers, image processing programs and the JPEG standard itself. (Figure 2. 20x24 pixel zoomed areas from a picture of a cat’s eye. Uncompressed original on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artefacts than libjpeg (middle) without requiring a larger file size.) The one major shortcoming with Guetzil, however, is that the algorithm takes significantly longer to create compressed images compared to currently available methods. That may seem like a deal-breaker but because of how well it performs in the quality department, Google feels the slower compression time is a worthy trade-off. Guetzil is available for anyone to download and try right now from GitHub.

When it appears on Google Home, apparently. That’s what the search giant is claiming after some users of its smart speaker heard a promotion for Disney’s Beauty and the Beast remake while it announced their daily schedule. When asked “Tell me about my day,” Google’s assistant finished the briefing with what sounds suspiciously like a 15-second ad. “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast opens today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me to tell you something about Belle,” it said. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 But Google insists what people heard isn’t actually an advertisement. "This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales," a Google spokesperson said in a statement. A source familiar with the partnership says no money was exchanged between Disney and Google for the ‘ad.’ A few hours after videos of the promo started appearing online, Google removed it and issued another statement. “What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” Google may have quickly removed this promo, but talk of “new ways to surface unique content” has an ominous ring to it. With ads infiltrating pretty much every part of our digital experiences, it wouldn’t be surprising if they eventually made their way onto smart speakers.

Google's advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos The Home Affairs Select Committee has written to the technology giant asking for an explanation into how Government adverts were placed on "inappropriate and hate-filled sites" and YouTube videos. The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising "pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way", while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google's advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. In a letter to Google's communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: "Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. "As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. "In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers." The internet giant's UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company "can and must do more" to combat what it called "bad advertising". "We've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network." An investigation by The Times claimed that rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers were among those receiving payouts from publicly subsidised adverts on YouTube. Mr Harris had said that while Google had practices in place to combat these incidents, it can not prevent them all. "With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don't always get it right. "In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies," he said. "We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more." However, Ms Cooper said the company's "lack of effort and social responsibility" towards the content was "extremely troubling". "It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content," she said. "The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube's very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred." Media advertising firm GroupM has suggested "a 100% foolproof system" to prevent further incidents may not be possible. The firm, which is part of advertising giant WPP, also warned that Google and YouTube's tools to stop bad advert placement were "not infallible" in a letter to clients. GroupM's chief digital officer Rob Norman said the technology giant should apologise over the incident. "We believe Google owes two apologies, one to advertisers for compromising their brand reputations and the other to consumers for the presence of the content," he said. "Google should also make clear that the flaw is in Google's controls, so no consumer may think that a brand, through its adjacency, is an endorser of the content."

By Michael Kan U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 17, 2017 12:49 PM PT Credit: Magdalena Petrova More like this Twitter Ruling Disappoints, but Doesn't Surprise Privacy Advocates Twitter Resists Subpoena to Release User's Data Without Warrant Government data requests to Google continue to rise Video Witcher 3 on a MacBook Air? Yep, with Nvidia GeForce Now Local police in Minnesota are trying to solve a bank fraud scheme by demanding Google give up data on people who looked up key search terms that may be related to crime. The warrant, issued to police in the city of Edina last month, is raising eyebrows among privacy advocates. It's a rare instance of U.S. law enforcement using mass data collection to solve a petty crime, said Nate Cardozo, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Edina police applied for the warrant to investigate a fraud case dealing with $28,500 that was wired out of a victim's bank account back in January. The criminal pulled off the scheme by posing as the victim and faxing over a forged U.S. passport to the bank. However, the image used for the U.S. passport is publicly available on the internet through a Google search, but not on Yahoo or Bing, according to the warrant application. As a result, Edina police suspect the criminal must have queried Google using a certain combination of search terms revolving around the victim's name. The warrant, which a judge signed, asks that Google hand over user information for people who queried the search terms. This includes the user's name, address, telephone number, birth date, payment information, and IP addresses. But the warrant also has limits. For instance, it applies to only users located in Edina, which has a population of about 50,000 and looks only at queries made between last December and Jan. 7. Edina police declined to comment on the case because it is still under active investigation. But according to the warrant, investigators believe the Google data will help them identify the criminal suspect. Others are more worried about the larger implications of the police action. "Could this type of search warrant be used to wrongly ensnare innocent people?" wrote Tony Webster, a public records researcher who initially uncovered the warrant. "Search warrants require supporting probable cause, not just mere suspicion or theory," he added.  U.S. authorities regularly do subpoena internet companies such as Google for information relating to criminal investigations.  However, in this case, the warrant issued to Edina police is far too broad and unconstitutional, Cardozo contended. He’s particularly concerned that the warrant amounts to a "fishing expedition" that exposes the whole town to an unlawful search. "If this warrant is constitutional, then the California highway patrol could ask Google for information on people who were speeding while using Google Maps," Cardozo said. "The DEA could get a search warrant on whoever emailed a marijuana dispensary." However, Google can stop the Edina search warrant in an appeal, which the local police likely won't win, he said. It's unclear if the internet company ever gave up the data. On Friday, Google said: "We aren't able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users." Before the Edina search warrant was granted, Google had previously opposed a separate subpoena from the local county that had also asked for the data.

Most Popular Havas Group U.K. has decided to halt all ad spending on Google and YouTube after ads for its clients appeared next to "questionable or unsafe content" online. "Havas Group U.K. has taken the decision on behalf of its U.K. clients, which include O2, Royal Mail, BBC, Dominos and Hyundai Kia, to pause all YouTube and Google Display Network (GDN) investment until further notice," the agency group said in a statement on Friday. The pullout comes amid growing scrutiny of the digital ad business, with marketers demanding progress in challenges such as ad fraud, measuring ad viewability to gauranteeing brand safety online. Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser, has been increasing the pressure this year by promising to stop paying for any digital media, ad tech companies, agencies or other suppliers for services that don't meet its criteria. "The days of giving digital a pass are over," Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard told an Association of National Advertisers meeting in January, urging the rest of the ad industry to follow P&G"s lead. "It's time to grow up. It's time for action." Hyundai and several other major advertisers saw their ads show up alongside videos that appeared to be support terrorism last month, prompting a call from the World Federation of Advertisers for Google and others to be more vigilant. Greg Paull, principal at marketing consultancy R3, called the Havas decision "a bold move, surely designed for shock value as it is a warning shot over the bow." It's "the first real manifestation of what Marc Pritchard has been calling for," Mr. Paull said. "Google will be eager to avoid this cascading." Havas winds up looking like a leader but the stand will be more significant if it is ever followed by larger agency holding companies such as WPP, Omnicom and Interpublic, said Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research. "It's one thing for WPP to say that this a problem, but it's a lot harder for them to say, we're taking our clients off," added Mr. Wieser. WPP CEO Martin Sorell said in a statement that the agency giant and its media buying arm GroupM have believe Google, Facebook and others have the same responsibility to safeguard advertisers as any media company. "They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements," he said. "GroupM, which has led or supported every industry initiative to raise standards in the digital media supply chain, is talking to the digital media owners at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues." Havas spends more than $216 million on digital advertising on behalf of clients in the U.K. per year, according to The Guardian. Its decision followed an investigation by The Times that revealed ads being displayed next to compromising content. "We have a duty of care to our clients in the U.K. marketplace to position their brands in the right context where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands' objectives," said Paul Frampton, chief executive and country manager for Havas Group U.K., in the company statement. He added in the statement that the company's "position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network's ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect." Havas is also working with its clients to find "alternative partners where are confident of the third party verification and safety guarantees," he said. Related Stories P&G Tells Digital to Clean Up, Lays Down New Rules for Agencies and Ad Tech to Get Paid Super Bowl Ads Show Up With YouTube Videos Promoting Terror Groups, Sparking Backlash While representatives from Google and YouTube declined to comment, Google U.K. Managing Director Ronan Harris posted a blog item Friday entitled, "Improving Our Brand Safety Controls." "We believe strongly in the freedom of speech and expression on the web -- even when that means we don't agree with the views expressed," Mr. Harris wrote. "At the same time, we recognize the need to have strict policies that define where Google ads should appear. The intention of these policies is to prohibit ads from appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content." Mr. Harris went on to say that Google's policies tend to work for the most part and the company invests millions of dollars each year and employs thousands of people "to stop bad advertising practices." "Just last year, we removed nearly two billion bad ads from our systems, removed over 100,000 publishers from our AdSense program, and prevented ads from serving on over 300 million YouTube videos," he added. That said, Mr. Harris mentioned that Google has begun a "thorough review" of its ad policies, with plans of making changings in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear.

There are 2.7 million apps for people to choose from, and to its credit, Google has a system called Bouncer that looks for and removes malicious apps. But numerous malicious apps have slipped through this safety net. Recommended for You How a Boy’s Lazarus-like Revival Points to a New Generation of Drugs The Entrepreneur with the $100 Million Plan to Link Brains to Computers Google’s New Tool Says Nearly 80 Percent of Roofs Are Sunny Enough for Solar Panels How DeepMind’s Memory Trick Helps AI Learn Faster Chemists Are First in Line for Quantum Computing’s Benefits Which is why Mahmudur Rahman and pals at Florida International University in Miami have developed a system called Fairplay, which searches for malicious behavior in the Google Play store in an entirely different way. Instead of scanning the code for malicious software, Fairplay follows the trails that malicious users leave behind when fraudulently boosting their ratings. By following these trails, Fairplay can spot malicious activity that otherwise slips through Google’s security system. Rahman and co base their new approach on a curious observation: users who post fraudulent reviews to boost the rankings of malicious apps tend to use the same account for lots of different apps. So once they are identified, they are easy to follow. It’s easy to see why malicious users behave this way. To leave a review or rating on Google Play, users must have a Google account, register a mobile device to that account, and then install the app on that device. That makes it hard to create lots of different accounts, so to keep their lives easy, malicious users tend to use just one. Rahman and co’s approach is to first identify malicious accounts and then map their activity. They began by downloading the reviews and ratings associated with all the newly uploaded apps to Google Play between October 2014 and May 2015. That’s nearly 90,000 apps and three million reviews. They then used traditional antivirus tools, along with human experts in app fraud, to manually identify over 200 apps containing malware. This forms their “gold standard” data set of malicious apps. They also asked the experts to identify Google accounts responsible for generating fraudulent reviews, finding 15 accounts that had written reviews for over 200 fraudulent apps. These 200 apps received a further 53,000 reviews. They data-mined these reviews to find a further 188 accounts that had each reviewed at least 10 of the fraudulent apps. “We call these guilt by association accounts,” say Rahman and co. From all this fraudulent activity, they selected a set of 400 fraudulent reviews to train a machine-learning algorithm to spot others like them. They also designed Fairplay to look at other potential indicators of malicious behavior, such as the number of permissions an app asks for and the way in which ratings appear over time, looking in particular for suspicious spikes in rating activity. Finally, they let the algorithm loose on the entire set of 90,000 newly released apps on Google Play. The results make for interesting reading. “FairPlay discovers hundreds of fraudulent apps that currently evade Google Bouncer’s detection technology,” say Rahman and co. More significant, the algorithm uncovered an entirely new form of coercive attack that forces ordinary users to write positive reviews for malicious apps. “FairPlay enabled us to discover a novel, coercive campaign attack type, where app users are harassed into writing a positive review for the app, and install and review other apps,” say the team. The campaign works by bombarding users with ads or otherwise making games difficult to play. However, the campaign lets users remove the ads, unlock another level in a game, or get additional features by writing positive reviews. Rahman and co uncovered this behavior by data-mining the reviews.  In a subset of 3,000 reviews, they found 118 that reported some level of coercion. For example, users wrote “I only rated it because i didn’t want it to pop up while i am playing,” or “Could not even play one level before i had to rate it [...] they actually are telling me to rate the app 5 stars.” That reveals an entirely new kind of coercive fraud attack that Google’s Bouncer does not spot. The question now is: what next? Identifying this kind of behavior makes it easier to crack down on. But in this cat-and-mouse game, it’s surely only a matter of time before malicious users dream up some other ingenious way to cheat.

However, with Google Wi-Fi, you can prioritize a device to get the best speeds possible on an otherwise crowded network. RELATED ARTICLE How to Use Quality of Service (QoS) to Get Faster Internet When You Really Need It Granted, you can do this on most traditional routers as well, but it’s certainly not as simple and easy as it is using Google Wi-Fi. Start by opening up the Google Wi-Fi app on your phone and tap on the tab with the settings gear icon and three other circles. Tap on “Priority Device”. Select the device that you want to prioritize by tapping on it. By default, it will be prioritized for one hour, but you can tap on “Change Time” to select a different time frame. You can select from 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours at the bottom. Next, hit “Save” up in the top-right corner. You’ll be taken back to the main settings page, but if you want to manually end the prioritization, you can go back into the Priority Device menu and tap on “End”. Unfortunately, Google doesn’t say exactly how much prioritization devices have, or how much other devices on the network would suffer from throttled speeds. But if you’re planning on watching some Netflix or playing an online game with some friends, this feature should help you get the best speeds possible on that device.

And right on cue, 9to5Google has the first report, with just enough juicy tidbits to whet our appetite for more. Each version of Android seems to bring changes to notifications—most recently, Nougat delivered direct replies and bundling—and it looks like Android O will continue to tweak the system. But 9to5Google’s tipsters didn’t supply any specifics as to what will be new or different, though it infers from a separate Andromeda rumor that will involve syncing across devices, which would certainly be a welcome change. The site has also been told that Google will be adding app icon badges for active notifications. There are already a few launchers and manufacturer-specific skins that offer badges, but for some reason Google has resisted them in the pure version of Android. Also, the site reports that Google is considering bringing picture-in-picture mode to Android O, like Apple added for the iPad in iOS 9. Presumably this would be limited to tablets, but with phone screens getting bigger and bigger, that might not necessarily be the case. Another feature reportedly on tap for Android O is smart text selection. Earlier this month, VentureBeat described a feature called Copy Less that would be smart enough to remember the last thing you were doing without actually needing to mess around with text handles. For example, as the site explains, if you leave an Android Messages conversation to look up the address of something, Android O would automatically store the address from Chrome onto the clipboard, ready to paste it when you return to your conversation. The same rumor said that Google was looking to add the ability to recognize contextual items like addresses inside texts as well. Further rumored enhancements for Android O include a Google Assistant-integrated toolbar widget, live icons (like the Calendar icon on the Pixel), low-power background apps, improvements to the MedaRecorder API, and “tons of enterprise stuff.” Google will presumably announce the next version of Android at its keynote presentation to kick off Google I/O, being held at the Shoreline Amphitheater from May 17-19. ’O’ really: While there isn’t a ton of detail here, there is just enough in this report to get us excited about the next version of Android, which we have to assume will be called Oreo. Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of all things Android, has already teased such a pairing on Twitter, and earlier this year, the search giant and cookie purveyor partnered on the Oreo Space Dunk mobile VR experience. But whatever it’s called, we can’t wait to see it. To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Google receives search warrant for identities of everyone who searched crime victim’s name If such a broad warrant were duplicated in other jurisdictions, local law enforcement might use Google as a first stop in their investigations. Greg Sterling on March 17, 2017 at 1:03 pm More According to Ars Technica, police in suburban Minnesota have obtained a court order requiring Google to divulge the identities of people who searched for the name or images of the local victim of financial fraud. It’s clear that the warrant is overly broad and would potentially open the door for similar “lazy” requests by police across the country. Search warrants and related law are governed by the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution. Typically, a law enforcement official must show “probable cause” to a judge to justify the warrant. Warrants may be issued against third parties that are not the subject of criminal investigation but may have information relevant to the investigation. The warrant in this case seeks the identity and associated information of all users who searched for the victim’s name, including home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, email addresses, payment information (e.g., credit cards) and IP and MAC addresses. Obviously, the privacy implications of such a broad request are disturbing. Potentially, if someone read or heard a news story about the victim and searched for more information, that individual would be swept up in the scope of the warrant, although there was no probable cause to believe that casual searcher was involved. The police should have identified particular suspects and then sought their information, rather than trying to use Google to do preliminary investigative work. If such a broad warrant were allowed and duplicated in other jurisdictions, local law enforcement would have incentives to use Google as a first stop in their investigations. They could make vague and expansive requests for information, hoping to identify potential suspects or perhaps impermissibly seeking information on “suspicious” persons on the basis of thin evidence. Google would then become an extension of police power and an instrument of potential abuse. While Google and local law enforcement apparently declined to comment, it’s likely that Google is trying to narrow the scope of the warrant.

The real question is how are we going to make any money out of it? The obvious answer is to introduce advertising, but this might not be so easy, after all. It happened! Google Home spoke an ad and it wasn't well received. It was only a little ad. It may not even have been an ad proper, but quite a few people thought it was and reacted.  When first activated, and after giving the time and weather, Google Home said:  "By the way, Beauty and The Beast opens in theaters today. In this version, Belle is the inventor. Sounds more like it to me." Google has claimed that it wasn't an ad and wasn't intended to be taken as an ad, but it was interpreted as such. Disney also says it didn't pay Google for it.  The reaction was mostly negative with users stating that Google Home was going to be off their future shopping lists.  However, ... We need to think about this carefully. What exactly is an ad? How can you tell the difference between news and an ad? After all, an ad is often just news about a product. Of course, the difference is that the ad is delivered to you in the hope that you will buy the product whereas news is delivered just to keep you entertained or more accurately to keep you listening or reading the source. You might think that ads on a voice input device are not going to work but listeners to commercial radio stations accept voice ads all the time. So in principle there is no problem.  But there will be if things go according to this scenario: Ok Google - switch the hall lights on. Hi Dave I can't do that right now because I need to tell you about the latest special offers from the local Google add-on store to help you get the best from your day.... Is this the sort of intrusive ads that users are anticipating? It is true that Google and many others have a habit of hijacking your time. Think of the unskipable You Tube ads, but in this case we have potentially something new - AI.  The big problem with ads is that they are often unwanted and uninteresting. It isn't the tracking and information gathering that ads involve that I object to - it is the inefficient and ineffective way that this data is used. You go onto Amazon and buy some toothpaste and then you are bombarded by ads for toothpaste, but I already bought it! My wish is that ads were more, not less, targeted to my interests. Occasionally, but very rarely, I see an ad that makes me stop in my tracks and reconsider some project or other having investigated the new possibilities some product offers me.  Ads at their best are just news about products.   So now let's think about voice control devices. We seem to personalise them: Alexa tell me a joke and bring them into our families. We ask them the time, want them to tell us the weather forecast and trust them to control our homes. Next we will encounter social robots like Jibo and similar. Alexa skills will presumably develop into full interactive AI, with a lot of flaws at first, but still effective.  Amazon's Alexa seems better placed to take advantage of its position. Whereas Google would have to sell ads to place on Google Home to earn revenue, Amazon only has to sell things via Alexa. What this means is that Alexa could simply introduce intelligent suggestions about things you might like, spread across Amazon's vast stock range, to increase Amazon's profits. Would you really find it so bad if: Alexa can you look up and tell me what is on at the cinema round the corner? Of course I can Dave but did you know that there is an excellent film on the FireTV tonight it is one you have wanted to watch for some time.  Is it an ad or is it an intelligent assistant just being helpful? You can see that the scope for blurring the lines between ads and advice is very great and our previous exchange is much more likely to go: Alexa switch the lights on in the hall. Of course Dave. I hope you don't mind but I notice that one of the LED lights has failed - would you like me to order some. There is a special offer on LumiSmarts at the moment. As long as the advice is connected to what is going on and the users needs and interests, it can pass as advice and help.  If you are still thinking that this is all terrible you need to work out how voice input is going to be paid for. At the moment the cloud services behind voice input devices is being provided as a loss leader. Voice input apps don't earn revenue and this is a big disincentive to develop them. Some payment has to be found at some point.  My best guess is that in the not to distant future users of Alexa and Home will receive a notification that they can either pay a monthly subscription or accept commercially  influenced advice, aka advertising.  As long as the advertising is smart and helpful I know which one I'd opt for, but on past performance smart is not the way the advertising industry generally goes.  Related Articles Amazon Offering More Incentives For Alexa Skills The State Of Voice As UI  Google Home Your Personal Assistant  Amazon Opens Up Alexa To Developers and Third Parties   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.  Gmail Add-ons Developer Preview 13/03/2017 Google has announced the developer preview of Gmail Add-ons which provides a new way for G Suite users to access an app's functionality directly from Gmail. + Full Story Python cx_Oracle Adds Direct Binding 15/03/2017 Oracle has released a new version of the Python interface for Oracle Database.
