SEOUL,KOREA 12 August 2016 - 10:30am Cho Jin-young The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) of South Korea came to a conclusion that Google Korea’s preloaded apps and subsidies for search ads do not constitute any abuse of market dominance. This is because Naver enjoyed a market share of more than 70%, Daum Kakao enjoyed a market share of 15% to 19% and that of Google was merely 2% to 8% during the period of 2008 to March this year, when Google was involved in preloading of apps in the South Korean market. The FTC also made a decision contrary to that of the EU with regard to Google’s search ad subsidies provided for mobile carriers. According to the FTC, the amount of the subsidies was very small in correlation with the company’s market share and, as such, the subsidies did not restrict competition in the market. The commission is planning to keep monitoring the possibility of Google Korea’s market dominance abuse, but restrictions are rather unlikely with its preloaded apps acquitted. Google’s Android OS supply contracts with smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics stipulate that Google’s Android applications cannot be loaded in the case of downloading of a mutant application. This means Samsung Electronics has to accept unremovable preloaded apps on its Android smartphones. This is for Google to increase its profits based on paid app sale and search ads by making consumers familiar with those apps. Google explained that the apps are to prevent the inconvenience of consumers that could arise when the mutant application is incompatible, but this act was criticized as being contradictory to its own open platform policy. A large number of people are still claiming that such preloaded apps negatively affect the domestic app ecosystem as South Korean app developers are driven to resort to games, SNS and the like due to the dominant market share of Google in the segments including video streaming, map information, etc.  Categories:  News ICT View the discussion thread.

 South Korea says investigating whether Google broke antitrust laws Reuters Aug. 11, 2016, 10:02 PM 100 facebook linkedin twitter email print File photo of a woman holding her smart phone which displays the Google home page, in this picture illustration Thomson Reuters SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's antitrust regulator said on Friday it is looking into whether Google has violated the country's anticompetition laws, marking the body's first acknowledgement of a formal scrutiny against the global internet search company. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) did not comment on the nature of its investigation of Google in its statement, and didn't disclose which potential violations it's investigating. Google, whose corporate parent is Alphabet Inc , declined to comment. The antitrust body's statement was in response to a local media report that said the KFTC decided to clear Google of anticompetition charges involving the pre-loading of the company's apps on smartphones running on the Android operating system.

The result has been prying Google+ from some of its most used services such as YouTube and now the Play Store. If you’ve ever gotten an app or media from Google’s Play Store you’ll notice that you needed to be signed into your Google account to do anything and you would be able to rate and review apps with Google+. When installing apps, some of the more social ones that share progress—like gaming apps—ask for specific details to share with Google+ and can be tedious if you prefer going through all of the social stuff and marking stuff private. So, without Google+ users will be able to review and rate via their main account. Now that Google+ isn’t tied to another of the company’s services it will be interesting to see what Google does with Plus—if the company tries to salvage it, allows it to sink, or simply discontinues it. Of course any step taken with Google+ would probably be gradual as Google+ does have a user base.

The latest leaks reveal a new tab that appears at the bottom of the Google Now stream. In one of the shots it’s called Panel, while in the two others it’s referred to as Dashboard. Our best guess is it’ll be some type of tool to better organize your notes, calendar, and other upcoming events saved in your Google account.

The Nexus Sailfish was put through the test, which confirms some of its key specs.  ( Twitter ) Advertisement HTC is expected to build both of Google's upcoming Nexus smartphones, which will also serve as launch vehicles for Android 7.0 Nougat. One of those devices, the Nexus Sailfish has just shown itself on AnTuTu benchmarks. Over the last couple of years, some of the biggest smartphone makers have shifted to a two-device strategy when launching new smartphones. The move is essentially portrayed as providing greater choices for consumers, typically in the form of larger and smaller screens and higher and lower prices. In September 2013, Apple was among the first high profile smartphone makers to introduce two new handsets simultaneously. The iPhone 5s was the company's flagship smartphone and featured a premium design constructed out of aluminum and packed in the world's first 64-bit smartphone processor. While the iPhone 5c was marketed as a lower cost alternative with lower end specs and plastic case. Samsung's launch of the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge in 2014, was Samsung's way of offering its customers a standard flat screen Galaxy Note or something a bit more radical, with the Galaxy Note Edge's curved display. This year, Samsung used a similar two-device strategy with the release of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and while it was rumored to be testing both a flat and curved display Galaxy Note 7, only one of those devices made the cut, the curved screen variant. Google followed Apple and Samsung and launched two new smartphones with the release of the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X in 2015. We've already reported numerous times, that Google is once again planning to launch a duo of new Nexus smartphones in the very near future. Google has reportedly partnered with HTC to build the smartphones, which are currently codenamed Marlin and Sailfish. We've recently seen renders of the new Nexus smartphones on video, make appearances on Geekbench, and now, the Nexus Sailfish has been spotted on AnTuTu Benchmark. According to the AnTuTu benchmark, which lists the smartphone as "Google Nexus Sailfish" and its rumored 5-inch display will sport a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080. In terms of power, the handset will include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip coupled with 4 GB of RAM. Its camera capabilities are listed as a 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front-facing shooter. The AnTuTu benchmark also showed the Nexus Sailfish being tested included 32 GB of internal storage and of course was running Android 7.0 Nougat. Recent reports claim Google is planning to unveil its new Nexus smartphones in the near future, possibly in August. We'll keep you posted on any additional Nexus news as it becomes available.

Nexus Marlin: The new 2016 Google Nexus phone in a nutshell By Chris Barraclough 11th Aug 2016 Features Tweet Leaks have revealed that there will be two new Google Nexus phones in 2016, the Nexus Sailfish by HTC and a second mobile nicknamed the Nexus Marlin. Here's all you need to know about the Google Nexus Marlin, including rumoured specs, the possible launch date and more. What is the Nexus Marlin? Each year Google launches at least one own-brand Nexus mobile phone, which are always the first handsets to boast the latest version of Google's Android OS. This is always a vanilla version of Android, with none of the heavy overlays that a lot of mobiles come packing (such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, Sony's Xperia X and other big Android phones). Google doesn't actually design and manufacture these Nexus phones itself, however. For instance, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P from 2015 were built by LG and Huawei respectively. In 2016 it appears that HTC will be manufacturing at least one of the new Nexus phones, and most likely both - the Nexus Sailfish and the Nexus Marlin. The Nexus Marlin appears to be the more powerful of the two new 2016 Nexus handsets, boasting a bigger (5.5-inch), sharper display than the Sailfish as well as the very latest Snapdragon 821 processor. This means it will also be the more expensive Nexus 2016 phone. Read next: Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P vs Nexus Marlin vs Nexus Sailfish What are the Nexus Marlin's specs? The Nexus Marlin hasn't been officially launched by Google, and so far all we have are rumoured specs: 5.5-inch Quad HD (2560x1440) screen Snapdragon 821 processor 12-megapixel rear camera 8-megapixel selfie camera 4GB RAM 32GB storage (microSD support uncertain) USB Type-C What features will the Nexus Marlin have? As with last year's 2015 Nexus phones, the Nexus Marlin will boast a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor for boosted security. You can also expect the funky new 'Night Light Mode', which like Apple's Night Shift mode makes the phone more comfortable to use in the evening. And of course you'll get all of the new Android Nougat features packed in there, before any other phone gets the update. Do we know the UK price and release date for the Nexus Marlin? Google hasn't officially announced the date of its next Nexus phone launch, but we're expecting the new Nexus Marlin and Sailfish handsets to be revealed in September 2016.

The search giant is testing a new “Dashboard” in Google Now, the personal assistant that offers contextually relevant information on Android. Multiple users have uploaded images and screen recordings with a new feature in Google Now — a Dashboard. The Google app looks the same as before except there’s a new bar at the bottom that offers the Google “Home” on the left, and the “Dashboard” on the right. Unfortunately, none of the images show what the Dashboard actually takes you to, but the “Home” is essentially the default Google Now homepage. Andrew Krause Related: Hands on with Android Nougat Developer Preview 5 One of the users who posted a screenshot of the new feature says “nothing appears” when he clicks Dashboard, meaning it’s likely not working. And it also seems to only show up when he’s using the Nexus Launcher, a proprietary launcher Google is bundling into Android Nougat for the upcoming Nexus devices. The buttons disappear when the user reverts back to the Google Now Launcher. The user, Andrew Krause, says he “made a calendar entry and a reminder in Keep and both appeared in the Dashboard. It seems to pull data from other Google services so that they are all available in one place.” Essentially if you use other Google services like Calendar, Inbox, and Maps, you’ll likely be able to see and act on notifications in the Dashboard. Related: Google Now tunnels deeper into your brain with upcoming Interests feature The APK for Google’s upcoming Nexus Launcher was unofficially leaked earlier this month; it seems like if you downloaded it you may be able to see this new Dashboard feature. That means Google may not have intended this feature to be seen yet, and it only affirms that the Nexus Launcher will bring proprietary features to Nexus devices only. This is not the only new feature the search giant is testing — a new “Explore Interests” feature recently began showing up for select users, allowing them to set specific categories and topics for Google Now to track.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Fiber is gearing up to expand beyond fiber-optic cable in a big way. A new filing with the FCC reveals plans to test its experimental wireless service in up to 24 U.S. locations, potentially removing the need for a physical hookup. The filing notes that Google would spend two years testing the service, though it wouldn’t be available for consumer use. Instead, the wireless internet would be limited to employees and “trusted testers. The company is already experimenting with similar technology in Kansas City, which was the first city to get Google Fiber. “We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum,” a Google Fiber spokesperson told Business Insider. “The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers.” Google Fiber’s original plan to install fiber-optic cables in cities and towns along the country is still chugging along, but it’s a slow and complicated process. Switching to wireless would make it a lot easier to expand quickly, and the company may have even delayed launch plans in two Silicon Valley cities to focus on the new strategy instead. If this pays off, we could see Google Fiber start to reach new cities a lot faster within the next few years.

The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said Google had forced mobile device manufacturers to pre-install its applications on mobile devices using the Android system, Xinhua reported. Google was also accused of placing its applications at priority positions on the home page of mobile devices to the detriment of alternative software. Google's software also prevented the installation of applications of other developers, the FAS was quoted as saying. "The Competition Law must be observed by all the companies that supply their products to the Russian Federation, including multinational corporations," Yelena Zayeva, Head of the Communications and Information Technologies Department of the FAS, said in the statement. The FAS said Google must pay the fine within 60 days after the order becomes effective. The Russian side is still discussing related issues with the company. The FAS ruled against Google last September over the company's abuse of its dominant market position, following a complaint filed by Yandex, one of the leading Internet technology firms in Russia. --IANS sku/ SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Maris will be replaced by David Krane, an early public relations executive at Google who is now a managing partner at GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, the firm said Thursday. Maris’ departure comes a year after Google, the company founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, announced it would reorganize itself as a holding company named Alphabet. Google’s core online ad business was separated from businesses like GV, self-driving cars and life sciences, all of which now go under an umbrella called Other Bets. As part of the reorganization, Alphabet asked for more financial accountability and cost consciousness from the various businesses. Social media Snapchat drops Asian filter Snapchat has removed a filter for photos that some say promoted racist Asian stereotypes. The social media app’s filters, also called lenses, allow users to change their appearance with silly faces or morph themselves into cartoonish animals and other characters. A filter that Snapchat says was inspired by Japanese animation placed slanted eyes on a user’s face. The filter was quickly derided by Snapchat users on Twitter. One Asian American user, Grace Sparapani tweeted that she was “shocked by how much it looked like the classic cartoon caricatures of Asians — squinty eyes and buckteeth.” Snapchat told USA Today the filter has been taken down and won’t be used again. The company says its filters “are meant to be playful and never to offend.” Acquisitions HP Enterprise makes a deal Hewlett Packard Enterprise is buying Silicon Graphics International Corp. for about $275 million, adding high-performance computing capabilities that improve data analytics.

The hastag #PalestineIsHere was born after an online petition in March 2016 condemned Google for removing the word "Palestine" from Google Maps. The company said the word was never there in the first place.  (Google Maps)   By Liam StackThe New York Times Thu., Aug. 11, 2016 Supporters of the Palestinian cause denounced Google online this week for removing the word “Palestine” from Google Maps, but there was just one problem: The company said the word had never been there in the first place. Even by the boom-and-bust standards of anger on social media, this tale spread quickly, spurred by statements of outrage from Palestinian advocacy groups, news stories and viral videos that included no comment from Google. An online petition from March condemning Google (and insinuating its “two Jewish founders” removed the word “Palestine” because of their alleged ties to Israel) had collected more than 280,000 signatures by Wednesday, more than 180,000 of those since the day before. Angry tweets were sent and there were calls to boycott the company. A hashtag, #PalestineIsHere, was born. But as far as Google Maps is concerned, it actually had not been. “There has never been a ‘Palestine’ label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for ‘West Bank’ and ‘Gaza Strip,’” the company said in a statement. “We’re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.” It is unclear if that bug played a role in spurring the online outrage. Article Continued Below Elizabeth Davidoff, a spokeswoman, said in an email that the company had also never used the label “Palestinian territories” on its maps. The bug affecting the words “Gaza Strip” and “West Bank” persisted on Thursday, but when Google Maps functions properly both areas are labelled and separated from Israel by a dotted line to signify that their borders are not internationally recognized. The word “Palestine” was recently removed from the local home page of the company’s search engine, but the reason was esthetic, not political, Davidoff said. It was taken down to make space for an Olympics-themed Google doodle, a design that sometimes greets users, as were country-specific tag lines for every country in the world. “There’s no Google-wide effort to remove Palestine or anything like that,” Davidoff said in an email. She said a GIF circulating online (and shared by the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace) that claimed to show a before-and-after image that proved the alleged deletion was fake. So, how did this happen? Part of it is a by-now familiar dynamic on social media. People are inclined to believe claims that reinforce their pre-existing beliefs, especially if they produce an emotional response. Kate Klonick, a resident fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School, said the cycle of outrage on social media is “reactive, it’s emotional, it’s not particularly thoughtful, but it is satisfying in a lot of ways for people.” And few issues are more emotionally fraught than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the most intractable and heated disputes in international affairs. The anger of Google’s critics was unlikely to be soothed by the facts of this case, Klonick said. “If you were upset that you thought Google removed Palestine, it does not ameliorate your anger at all to find out they never had Palestine there to begin with,” she said. Naomi Dann, a spokeswoman for Jewish Voice for Peace, said the claims about Google Maps gained traction in recent days in part because a journalist group, the Forum of Palestinian Journalists, criticized the company in a statement. (Dann also said the GIF her organization posted to Twitter was created by one of her colleagues.) In the statement, the forum said it believed “what the Google search engine has done is part of an Israeli plan to propose the entrenchment of ‘Israel’ as the name of a state for generations to come and the abolition of ‘Palestine’ once and for all, and its erasure from any map.” Emad Zakaria, who wrote the statement, said he heard the claim that Google removed the word “Palestine” from the website of a Palestinian organization in Lebanon whose name he could not remember. “Anyone looking for Palestine on Google will not be able to find it,” he said. Still, the initial source of the outrage remains a mystery. The claims about Google had extra emotional weight because they involved a visual representation of Israel and Palestine, Dann said. “Maps have always been political, and the ways that borders are demarcated on them is always political,” she said.

Something intriguing: a new open source operating system from Google, Fuchsia, has found its way to Google's repositories. There's pretty much no information anywhere about this, and maybe I'm making way too much of this, but until we know more - anybody care to speculate? There's a Fuchsia file that just reads "Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)", so that's not much help. There's documentation on the kernel, Magenta, which may be of more use - it reads, among other things, "Magenta targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." There's probably a lot more documentation in the repository, but I don't have the proper background to infer too much from what's going on. Another very, very intriguing piece of information: it turns out several big names from the operating system industry (is that even a thing?) are involved - people who worked on NewOS, BeOS, Danger, iOS, and Palm's webOS, such as Travis Geiselbrecht and Brian Swetland. This could be "just" a research project, or something more. Very interesting.

Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Russia’s antitrust authority has fined Google 438 million roubles ($8.83 million) after finding it guilty of abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on Androids. The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in September last year deemed Google in breach of a law on “protecting competition” after an investigation following a complaint by Russia’s largest search engine, Yandex. Yandex asked the antitrust authorities to prevent Android phones from being automatically bundled with Google’s search engine. The FAS said that Google had two months to pay the fine. Yelena Zayeva, the head of its department for regulating communications and IT was quoted in the statement as saying the ruling “will allow the development of competition on the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive effect for consumers.” All companies whose production is on sale in Russia have to observe the law on competition, “including transnational corporations,” Zayeva added. Google said in a statement said: “We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyse closely before deciding our next steps.” “In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia,” Google said. The tech giant’s Android operating system dominates the smartphone market with a share of around 80 per cent, which enables Google to offer search and other services to handset users. Russia’s antitrust authority had been holding consultations with Google aimed at reaching an amicable agreement, but this required Google to admit guilt. Google has insisted that consumers are free to choose whether to use its services. Google has been hit by similar antitrust charges in other countries, particularly in the European Union, which has launched three cases against Google, one of which is specifically about using the dominance of the Android mobile phone operating system to restrict competition. Russia’s antitrust authority this week also launched legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of resellers’ prices for iPhones in the country. Apple said in a statement said: “Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews The Google Play Store scraps Google+ integration Google cuts social from the Play Store, now accepts app reviews without a G+ account. by Ron Amadeo - Aug 11, 2016 10:05 pm UTC Login to bookmark Callip Hall The great deplusification of Google continues as a Google+ has been removed from yet another Google product. This time it's the Play Store, which has dropped Google+ votes from apps and nixed the G+ account requirement from app reviews. There was an entire Google+ focused "People" section on the Play Store that showed apps and ratings from people you follow on Google+. The Play Store also allowed users to "+1" apps on the Play Store, which served as a vote of approval from people you follow. Both features are being stripped out of Google Play, starting earlier this week. The other feature being removed is the requirement to have a Google+ account to leave a Play Store review on apps, games, and media. Several users have reported to Android Police that they can now leave reviews using their regular Google account, where before they were nagged to created a Google+ account. The move is the latest in a long, long retreat from the "Google+ everywhere" strategy that was enforced with an iron fist a few years ago. Google+ never took off the way Google has originally hoped, and now the social network is being left to stand on its own.

This new tab, labeled “Dashboard”, will apparently be used to pull information from other Google services such as Keep, Gmail, Google Photos, and others to bring all of that information into one central location. This feature is allegedly only undergoing internal testing at Google right now, but following the leaked Nexus Launcher APK last week, it’s already showing up for some users. Android Police cites 3 sources on Google+ where they obtained the screenshots seen below. Seeing that the feature only appears with the Nexus Launcher could mean that it will be associated with Google Assistant which is rumored to possibly be exclusive to Google’s own devices. So what does this feature do? Well, we don’t really know. Based on the name and tips that Android Police has obtained, Dashboard will gather data from other Google services. For example, it might pull emails from Gmail that it deems important so you don’t miss them. It may also pull to-do list items from Google Keep, or pull information from Google Photo’s Assistant tab. It’s unclear if third-party services will be able to tie into this or when it will debut. From what we’ve heard so far, it seems pretty useful. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Google this week rolled out multitasking support for its Docs, Sheets, and Slides iOS apps. iPad owners running iOS 9 can finally tap into the operating system's Slide Over and Split View functions while using the Google Apps for Work suite. Swipe in from the right to see the multitasking sidebar, which provides quick access to things like email, Twitter, and Slack. Supported apps, meanwhile, can take over one half the screen with Split View: Just pull further to the left and the program will snap into place. The Web giant took nearly a year to launch support for the same features other applications have long provided. Better late than never, right? Cupertino introduced split-screen multitasking in June 2015, teasing other mobile OS upgrades like Apple Maps transit directions, the built-in News app, and Apple Pay. Despite the delay, Google users can let out a sigh of relief knowing it will now be easier to complete a slideshow presentation while watching Orange Is the New Black, write a term paper while playing Candy Crush, and fill out a spreadsheet while tweeting about how much you hate spreadsheets. //Related Articles Apple Releases iOS 10 Beta 3 to Developers Other minor changes include the ability to insert images and page breaks in Docs, as well as bug fixes and performance improvements in all three programs. iOS multitasking is available on recent Apple hardware, including the 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 4. Google, meanwhile, has been working on a multitasking feature for Android tablets since at least last winter, when the Pixel C team revealed via a Reddit Ask Me Anything that split-screen is in the works.

The string of moves started last Monday, Aug. 1, with the general availability of customer-supplied encryption keys for Google Compute Engine. The enterprise check-list item followed a week later with the acquisition of Orbitera Inc., a startup focused on cloud-based commerce for ISVs. Then, on Tuesday, Aug. 9, Google cut prices on its already discounted Preemptible VMs by up to 33%, harkening back to a couple years ago when it tried to drive the cloud conversation by being the lowest priced option on the market. Google already encrypts all data at rest in Compute Engine, but this new security feature gives companies even more control. Workiva Inc., a financial services software provider in Ames, Iowa and Google Cloud Platform customer, worked closely with Google to drive the requirements around the bring-your-own-keys capability, said Dave Tucker, Workiva vice president of engineering. "Our customers want to know more about how you do encryption and how you do keys," Tucker said. "Everyone wants to supply your own keys for any data you put out there." The ability to bring your own keys is a basic functionality to operate a public cloud, which Amazon has offered for years, said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research. The average customer doesn't care about where the keys are -- but it matters for enterprise clients with more complex networks or organizations with strict regulatory or compliance demands. Orbitera deal another move to the enterprise Google has acquired a handful of smaller startups to fold into its cloud platform since Diane Greene took over the unit last November, and Orbitera fits that bill. The West Hollywood, Calif., company automates commerce components for cloud services for ISVs, service providers and channel organizations. More than 60,000 enterprise stacks have been launched on the platform, according to Google. It's unclear exactly how Google will integrate the service into its platform, but one of the knocks it has faced is a lack of partners and integrations, so this could help fill that void. Currently, Orbitera customers can use its service on AWS and Azure, with support from Rackspace and CenturyLink coming soon, according to the company's website. Google wasn't even on the radar, so this at least gets the company in the conversation to build its enterprise support, said Meaghan McGrath, an analyst at Technology Business Research, in Hampton, N.H. Orbitera will maintain its neutrality in supporting multi-cloud commerce, Google said, and this fits with other moves it has made recently, including the beta rollout of Stackdriver, which enables multi-cloud management, McGrath said. It's also an acknowledgement that Google competes in a market where most customers already use AWS, which means it needs to make its cloud work alongside those implementations. "If Google cloud started from the very beginning, they'd probably want all that business, but at this point they're pigeonholed into coexisting with AWS and, to a lesser extent, with Azure," McGrath said. Another networking failure Both of these moves are viewed by industry observers as positive steps, if not major leaps, for Google to gain ground on the long lead of Amazon Web Services and even Microsoft Azure. But the momentum was marred slightly by a widespread service disruption last week. The problem started at 12:55 a.m. Pacific Time, Friday, Aug. 5, with some customers experiencing network latency and packet loss to Google Compute Engine, Cloud Virtual Private Network, Cloud Router and Cloud SQL until engineers resolved the compounding problems caused by a faulty router, according to a postmortem from Google. The disruption lasted 99 minutes and all regions were impacted by the disruption, though the U.S.-West region was only down for 10 minutes, according to uptime tracking company CloudHarmony. Workiva noticed disruption for some of its clients, Tucker said. The company distributes workloads to prepare for these types of incidents, and affected customers were notified once the problem was spotted. "People understand that things like this can happen, but more surprisingly it's been so stable for us lately that it was really more of an anomaly than it's been in the past," Tucker said. "They're getting stronger all the time and we're very comfortable with the overall sustainability of the platform today." Customers are often better equipped to deal with disruptions today than they were in the earliest days of public cloud, said Melanie Posey, research vice president at IDC, in Framingham, Mass. "I remember seven or eight years ago having these calls in response to an AWS outage or Gmail being down and everybody would start freaking out and saying public cloud is unreliable," Posey said. "This seems like it was a networking thing, and networking things can happen in the public cloud." Networking has been a problem for Google, and in April it had a global outage due to a network failure. This latest incident had less of an impact, partly because of the time it occurred, but also because it only affected internet control message protocol checks, while the transmission core protocol traffic remained functional, said Jason Read, founder of CloudHarmony, which is owned by analyst firm Gartner. Regardless, it isn't a good sign for Google, and the relative quiet around the disruption highlights how far it is behind Amazon, Read said. "Had this been a global [Amazon] EC2 outage, which has never occurred in my years of monitoring this stuff, it would have been an apocalyptic event and headline news for days," Read said. Price drops back again Google rounded out its latest set of moves with a price drop to its Preemptible VMs. The service was rolled out last year and provides cut-rate instances for batch jobs and fault-tolerant workloads used for short periods. Cycle Computing, which provides orchestration software for big compute and big data projects, works with AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform. It's seen three times growth over the past year and increased interest in all three platforms, particularly Google, said CEO Jason Stowe. "We anticipate this is going to accelerate that evaluation even further for financial services, life sciences, manufacturing customers -- their workloads tend to be friendly toward preemptible instances," he said. While price remains an important consideration, price drops don't seem to resonate as they did two years ago when every tit-for-tat move from the hyper-scale providers generated headlines. Many cloud customers now find themselves spending more to take advantage of higher-level services, or better understand how to control their own costs. "We're at a point [of] how we do optimization, in terms of estimating usage and prepaying and things like that, where we've got a pretty stable model with how we work with them on a pricing standpoint," Tucker said. "We always love to see price cuts from anybody, but it's just not like it was there for a while." Trevor Jones is a news writer with TechTarget's Data Center and Virtualization media group.

Filed on August 12, 2016 Share More > Vote Tapping into the findings of the quest for eternal life - that has haunted us eternally From MIT to Silicon Valley, prominent thinkers are working feverishly to beat ageing once and for all, and each has a pressing personal deadline for finding a solution. For the new breed of anti-ageing researchers, the Holy Grail is not necessarily a longer lifespan but a longer health span. The longer we can delay the typical diseases of ageing, the greater "compression of morbidity" we'll achieve, not only forestalling the onset of cancer, heart disease, and dementia, but also lessening how long we'd have to live with them. Bill Gifford, author of Spring Chicken: Stay Young Forever (or Die Trying) rightly argues that no one wants to be like Jonathan Swift's long-suffering Struldbrugs, cursed by immortality, without eternal youth. Far better, he believes, to live until 85 in good health, "and then go out quickly - preferably while riding a motorcycle, or maybe BASE jumping". We've extended our lives before. In the US, for instance, American life expectancy rose nearly 30 years from 1900 to 2000, thanks to better public sanitation, advances in neonatal care that drastically reduced infant-mortality rates, and improvements in senior care that extended life for adults with diseases that were once certain death sentences. But those were top-down solutions. Today, our health span is largely in our own hands, and that's a problem. While we'd all embrace cures for cancer, heart disease, and stroke, University of Chicago professor of public health - and life-extension sceptic - S. Jay Olshansky explains to Gifford, they would only increase average life expectancy by about 10 years, still well short of 100, because most of us wouldn't make the lifestyle changes to effectively ward off diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and other conditions for which our physical and mental fitness are at least partially responsible. Ironically, the reason we wouldn't may be that most of us feel too young. Surveys conducted by the MetLife Mature Market Institute find that no matter how old people are, they think that "old age" is still 10 or 15 years away. This may be psychologically healthy, but to the extent that it keeps us from taking action to preserve our health, it's a disaster. And so, short of a collective increase in willpower, we'll continue the search for anti-ageing magic bullets. In a California lab, Gifford witnesses a parabiosis experiment, in which old and young mice are opened up and sutured together, allowing the junior rodent's blood to course through the veins of the senior. The older mice, once conjoined, go on to live four to five months longer than non-rejuvenated contemporaries, an increase comparable to an additional 20 years of life in humans, along with marked improvements in cognition. "Youth is contagious," he concludes, and while he raises the possibility of a rising vampire class, with Donald Trump and his cronies paying impoverished young people for plasma transfusions, Gifford assures us that researchers are instead working to determine exactly what components of younger blood can be replicated as a potential cure for ageing. A NEW BREED OF "MILLENNIALS" The prospect of such treatments has energised a more radical group of thinkers, including Aubrey de Grey, controversial chief science officer of SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence), who has suggested that, as we engineer ageing out of our very cells, some people born today may live 1,000 years. Such claims have drawn intense interest from certain Silicon Valley magnates who have made the war on ageing a near obsession. In 2013, Google invested in Calico, the California Life Company, hoping that its application of "moonshot thinking" to biotechnology could cure ageing once and for all. (Google and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie have since pledged up to $1.5 billion to Calico.) Ray Kurzweil, Google's director of engineering, is counting on artificial-intelligence advances that will enable the brain to be downloaded to a computer, bringing about effective immortality, especially if and when that consciousness is uploaded into a fresh bio-robotic husk. "The whole idea of a 'species' is a biological concept," he says. "What we are doing is transcending biology." This idea is more fully explored in Virtually Human: The Promise - and the Peril - of Digital Immortality, by Martine Rothblatt, PhD, a technologist and medical ethicist who is CEO of biotech firm United Therapeutics. Her heady book explores how virtual humanity will extend human life, or at least consciousness, indefinitely. She proposes nothing less than "liberty from death" via "techno-immortality", and aims to guide readers through the inevitable transition from "a society of flesh only to a mind-centric society". Here's how it will work: A "mindfile", a digital database of your life and personality, will be used by an operating system called "mindware" to create a "mindclone" with your unique consciousness. Existing alongside you at first, your mindclone would live on long after your mortal body expires and, when biotechnology catches up, be downloaded into a new shell. Virtual or android, your mindclone will allow you, via true-to-life visual representation, to continue giving guidance and love to your spouse, children, and friends long after you die - after all, your mindclone is you. Only slightly less mind-blowing than this technology is Rothblatt's conviction that the many thorny questions raised by the prospect of millions of mindclones living on forever in cyberspace will be easily resolved - once everyone sees the light. Will biological humans treat mindclones as second-class citizens? "Fleshism" will certainly be a challenge, but every new group entering society faces discrimination. We will surely adapt to "non-flesh conscious beings". Will we love them? How could we not? They are us. If a lover dies, why not marry his or her mindclone? Rothblatt has "no doubt that love will transcend substrate". And yet, while we hope that those we leave behind would cherish more time with us, would they rush to consult our avatar when they have crises, or invite it to their wedding? And if they don't, would the mindclone feel the pain of rejection? Citing Kurzweil's thinking, Rothblatt is confident that society will care for any unwanted mindclones who are, after all, conscious and deserving of protection. A HEALTHY FATALISM Rothblatt may be overly optimistic - she insists that creating mindclones is a fundamental reproductive right - but her challenges still merit thought: When we interact with friends on Facebook or Instagram, aren't we already communicating with a virtual consciousness? We have "friends" online we've never met, yet sometimes connect with on a deeper level than we do with our "flesh friends". And today's social media are certainly less immersive than they will be decades from now. Why not generate an immortal double who won't miss out? Perhaps because, for most of us, this world is enough. In a 2013 Pew Research survey, only 38 per cent of adults said they would undergo treatments to extend their lives to 120 or beyond - and while most respondents did hope to live longer than the current average American life expectancy of 79, the median aspirational increase was a relatively modest 10 years. Adam Leith Gollner, the author of The Book of Immortality: The Science, Belief, and Magic Behind Living Forever, a sweeping, entertaining survey of our most fruitless pursuit, persuasively suggests tapping the brakes: "For now, even if there were a way to extend human life - and there really isn't - most of us wouldn't want it," he writes. "Instead, we'd opt for what inevitably awaits us, that ultimate grace bestowed upon all humans: the chance to die when our time eventually comes." Gifford cites research that, while the extension of average lifespans to even 120 would not necessarily sap the planet's resources, anti-ageing breakthroughs that would delay menopause for decades could prove disastrous. If couples could produce offspring in their 90s, 100s, or beyond, it's easy to extrapolate a world population of 100 billion by 2170. Futurists like de Grey and Rothblatt may put their faith in human ingenuity to figure out problems of food, space, employment, and distraction. But pondering a planet of multi-centenarians, Gifford concludes, "I started to think that, as dreadful as ageing is, maybe immortality wasn't such a hot idea, either." - Psychology Today Share More > Vote   Popular Comments Voted General Want a salary above Dh20,000?

Tor Social Contract promises no backdoors and complete honesty with its users The Tor Project has taken a leaf out of Google’s book and pledged to ‘do no harm’ to its users in the form of a ‘Social Contract‘  drawn up to ‘help promote and protect the essential human rights of people everywhere.’ The ‘Tor Social Contract’ covers six guiding principles that the Project intends to adopt after confidence in the network was shaken in recent months. The anonymity search engine is often viewed as a gateway to the dark web and all its potentially nastiness. A study last year alleged that the majority of traffic to hidden sites on the Tor network for example was to those featuring images of child abuse. But the Tor Project insists it has loftier principles than that. Social Contract   “In order to ensure that project members build a Tor that reflects the commitment to our ideals, we’ve taken a cue from our friends at Debian and written the Tor Social Contract – the set of principles that show who we are and why we make Tor,” said the blog. “Our social contract is a set of behaviours and goals: not just the promised results we want for our community, but the ways we seek to achieve them. The principles can also be used to help recognize when people’s actions or intents are hurting Tor. Some of these principles are established norms; things we’ve been doing every day for a long time; while others are more aspirational – but all of them are values we want to live in public, and we hope they will make our future choices easier and more open.” Essentially, the Tor social contract is divided into six separate aims. The first ambition is to “advance human rights by creating and deploying usable anonymity and privacy technologies.” Tor said that privacy, the free exchange of ideas, and access to information are essential to free societies. Its second ambition is to be open and transparent. “We are committed to transparency; therefore, everything we release is open and our development happens in the open,” it said. “Whenever feasible, we will continue to make our source code, binaries, and claims about them open to independent verification.” Its third ambition is to keep all its tools free to use, adapt and distribute. Its fourth is to make make Tor and related technologies ubiquitous through advocacy and education. The project said they are ‘ambassadors for online freedom.’ Its fifth pledge is to be honest about the capabilities and limits of Tor and related technologies. “We never intentionally mislead our users nor misrepresent the capabilities of the tools, nor the potential risks associated with using them,” it said. “Every user should be free to make an informed decision about whether they should use a particular tool and how they should use it.” And finally Tor pledged, like Google did so many years ago, to do no harm. “We will never intentionally harm our users,” it wrote. “We take seriously the trust our users have placed in us. Not only will we always do our best to write good code, but it is imperative that we resist any pressure from adversaries who want to harm our users.” “We will never implement front doors or back doors into our projects,” it promises. “In our commitment to transparency, we are honest when we make errors, and we communicate with our users about our plans to improve.” What should be the biggest consideration when devising a mobile strategy? Security Compliance Connectivity Applications Education Infrastructure Other View Results  Loading ... Tor Confidence It could be argued that confidence in Tor has been shaken somewhat by recent events. Last year for example it was claimed that researchers funded by the US government had launched a five month attack to unmask Tor users. Tor alleged last November that the FBI had paid “at least $1m (£675,000)” to researchers at Carnegie Mellon university (CMU) in Pittsburgh to hack the Tor network. Tor made reference to an attack by the FBI in late 2014 which took down dozens of Tor sites, including the drug selling website Silk Road 2. CMU denied the Tor allegation that the FBI had outsourced a cyber attack in return for cash payment, and pointed to “a number of inaccurate media reports”. But later court documents proved that the CMU was funded by the US Department of Defence, to try and identify users of the service. Of course Tor was likely to receive attention from law enforcement. Whilst it offers anonymity for web users, it is also widely used for criminal purposes, such as operating contraband websites. And it is increasingly being used by attackers to hide their identities as they scan for vulnerabilities or carry out attacks. Tor was also rocked a couple of months ago when one of its developers, Jacob Appelbaum, was forced to step down amid sexual misconduct allegations. Are you a security pro? Try our quiz!

Last February, the FAS announced an investigation into Android after complaints from local search engine Yandex that Android phones came bundled with some Google apps. Yandex whined that this was anticompetitive and was sucking away its business customers. In a statement, the FAS said it was imposing the fine (equal to around three hours' worth of profit last quarter for the search giant) because Google was forcing Russian mobile phone companies to install its search app, its Maps, and its App store. The FAS also objected to these services occupying prime real estate on the screens of Android phones, and to the Chocolate Factory banning some Russian apps from its storefront. "We are confident that the requirements pursuant will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will benefit our customers. Competition Law must be observed for all the companies whose products are supplied to the Russian Federation – including multinational corporations," said Elena Zaeva [Google translation], head of the FAS Communications Regulatory Authority and the Office of Information Russia. Given the tiny size of the fine, Google isn't going to be too worried about the financial cost of this, but the search giant isn't flavor of the month in Russia. Putin and his pals don't like the idea of a Yankee company having that much of a hold over the local smartphone market. In May, Russia's Open Mobile Platform got government support in its efforts to build a locally developed smartphone operating system, although since then it has received little traction among local buyers of phone manufacturers. Google had no comment on the matter at time of publication. ® Updated to add "Google complies with the law in every country where we operate, and while we’re disappointed with the Appellate court’s judgement and plan to appeal the decision to the Supreme court, will work to comply with the FAS in order to do so in the interim," a Google spokesman told The Reg.

After years of foot-dragging, most IT organizations have concluded that resistance to cloud infrastructure is futile. Industry giants Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are approaching sales of a billion dollars a month, and major businesses, such as Capital One, GE and Netflix, have moved business IT operations to infrastructure as a service. Now the question for most IT organizations isn't if they should use cloud services, but when, where and which ones. Knowing when to use cloud computing is a matter of corporate strategy and IT cloud maturity. But determining where and which services -- namely the list of applications to migrate and which infrastructure as a service [IaaS] providers to adopt -- depends on a myriad of factors, including legacy infrastructure, private and hybrid cloud plans, application architecture, service requirements, existing vendor relationships, regulatory requirements and the need for global reach and distribution. To be successful, an organization needs to look closely at the capabilities, advantages and drawbacks of a potential IaaS provider. Then, evaluate options in light of existing and planned application portfolios. Growing IaaS market Blending IaaS and PaaS means the selection of a cloud provider is no longer IT's alone, since it's not a choice solely about infrastructure. Though the worldwide market for cloud infrastructure is still fragmented, a handful of vendors garner just over half the total revenue: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure and Salesforce. Figures compiled by Synergy Research show that AWS alone owns about one-third of the IaaS market, while both Azure and Google are growing annually at triple-digit rates. AWS, Azure and Google Cloud are the most common options for a public IaaS provider. IBM, meanwhile, provides an interesting mix of an open source IaaS, IBM platform as a service (PaaS) and hosted bare-metal servers. With IBM's use of OpenStack for IaaS and hybrid cloud, one could lump it into the broader OpenStack public cloud ecosystem, alongside DreamHost, Internap and Rackspace. However, IBM has a richer portfolio than those other options. VMware -- given its dominant position as the virtualization platform of choice in business data centers --is an IaaS provider worth mentioning because of its vCloud Air product and network of service partners. VMware's vCloud illustrates an important distinction between public cloud services: the level of support for hybrid deployments. Although all vendors provide ways of securely connecting private infrastructure and public resources, AWS and Google are notable for only being available as shared services. In contrast, OpenStack and vCloud can be deployed and managed by internal IT. Although Salesforce has some sophisticated application development services, it's primarily used as a packaged application, or software as a service, rather than an application platform, or platform as a service. Salesforce, a result, is qualitatively different from the other four cloud leaders. Infrastructure and platform services were once considered well-defined and distinct service paradigms. Over time, traditional IaaS vendors have added richer, higher-level features, such as machine learning, business intelligence (BI), streaming data ingestion, mobile app back ends and serverless, event-driven microservices to their portfolios. The result is considerable overlap between products, such as AWS or Azure, and traditional, pure-play PaaS products, such as Cloud Foundry, Force.com, Heroku or Red Hat OpenShift. Although AWS and Azure don't draw sharp distinctions between their infrastructure and platform services, Google and IBM do, with clearly identified and branded PaaS stacks. Blending IaaS and PaaS means the selection of a cloud provider is no longer IT's alone, since it's not a choice solely about infrastructure. With the growing variety and sophistication of application services, along with alternative deployment vehicles, such as containers and event-driven compute services, developers play an increasingly important, and perhaps central, role in evaluating and selecting a cloud IaaS provider. Download this podcast Public cloud adoption causing some big vendors to stumble Public cloud adoption is causing some legacy vendors, like VMware, to struggle against new competitors, like AWS, according to David Linthicum. Cloud native vs. traditional apps drive IaaS provider choice A fundamental factor when evaluating an IaaS provider is your application type. This illustrates the role developers must play in the selection process, because the cloud is far more than a new deployment location. Whether you call it cloud-native or third platform, cloud services have ushered in new ways of designing, partitioning, scaling, testing and deploying applications. Cloud-first, greenfield apps are extremely modular. They are built around cloud services and application program interface (API) calls, designed for shared infrastructure and can be quickly deployed, moved and scaled. In contrast, legacy, client-server applications are built assuming ownership of an entire OS. They are shoehorned into shared infrastructure via hypervisors and VMs; in other words, they can run on, but aren't built for, the cloud. This architectural distinction has profound implications on the type of cloud service, and IaaS provider, that's best for a particular organization. Some products mimic the VM environment of internal data centers; others are mostly a collection of RESTful services and APIs that can be mashed up into any type of application. A prime example of these contrasting approaches is the bifurcation of EMC/VMware's private cloud product line. Its Enterprise Hybrid Cloud based on vSphere is designed for traditional applications, while the Native Hybrid Cloud targets next-generation, modular, microservices-based designs. The dichotomy carries over to the public cloud. For example, by offering basic compute, storage volumes, file systems and private networks, AWS can be made to look like a bunch of VMs and network-attached storage running in a private data center. That would be perfect for legacy databases and server-based applications. However, AWS can also be a platform for applications that are infrastructure-agnostic and based on higher-level services, such as NoSQL databases, BI processing, Hadoop-like clusters, message queues, push notification services, media transcoders and search engines. When choosing an IaaS provider, consider the type of applications you'll deploy and where they fall on the spectrum between traditional and cloud-native. Applications that fall predominantly on the traditional side of the range will work best on systems like vCloud or SoftLayer bare-metal servers that resemble traditional VM infrastructure. Those shifted to the cloud-native side are better suited for an IaaS and PaaS combination, such as those from AWS, Azure or Google.

First tumbling run is marvelous. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.55pm EDT 16:55 That was a 13.800 for Steingruber. Not enough.

Bit of a hop on the landing, alarming commentator Kupets. Tutkhalian’s score from floor, meanwhile, flashes briefly. It was under 11. Next up is Andrade, who is out of medal contention. Andrade wows the crowd. Steingruber does not wow the judges. Her medal hopes are gone.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.47pm EDT 16:47 Here’s Mustafina now, trying to nail down a spot on the podium. She looks more confident on the floor than she did on the beam. Last run goes high into the air, and she barely stays in bounds. Should be in good shape. Might be the quietest bunch of Brazilians ever recorded here as we await Mustafina’s floor score. And it’s ... it’s ... 13.933? Updated at 4.48pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.41pm EDT 16:41 So the good news for Steingruber -- she blew away her qualifying score on beam and is slightly up on the other two.

Updated at 4.32pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.28pm EDT 16:28 Andrade, still very much in medal contention, starts her beam routine with a painful-looking split. She wobbles a bit -- it’s as if she can’t quite contain her nervous energy. Fun to watch, but judges may mark her off a bit. Landing isn’t bad, though. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images Updated at 4.32pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.26pm EDT 16:26 Britain’s Downie up on uneven bars now, trying to continue an improbable charge toward the podium. She comes very close to touching the floor but keeps her feet off. She does not, though, keep her feet on the landing, falling to her knees. That, sadly, will probably knock out any chance she had of getting a medal. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.23pm EDT 16:23 Tutkhalian had a nice beam routine going, but she landed on her heels and tumbled onto her back. I don’t have the Code of Points memorized, but I think that’s a deduction. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.20pm EDT 16:20 Shang and Downie are now two points above their qualifying scores through three rotations. Will that put them in contention? Will do the numbers soon. 13.866 for Mustafina. Actually better than she did in qualifying, where she fell, but not good. Updated at 4.21pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.18pm EDT 16:18 Wang Yan is next on beam. No major problems but not close to Biles’ difficulty: 14.666. Eythora Thorsdottir, sounds Icelandic but is actually competing for the Netherlands, gets a 14.533 on floor, well above her qualifying score. Mustafina up on beam now. Wobbles a couple of times. Big run coming up, and ... she stopped partway through it. Courtney Kupets on commentary says Mustafina was supposed to do a connected series but didn’t, like a figure skater stepping out of a triple-double combination. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.13pm EDT 16:13 And the score is up for Biles ... 15.433.

Here we go ... Biles with her 2 1/2 “wolf turn,” which looks like something Michael Jackson would’ve done. A little wobble after her first flip, but she’s OK. No trouble with her next big pass. Dismount is pretty. Not AS smooth as her qualifying or team routines, but that should be enough to drop Mustafina.

But Mustafina has done her best event. Biles has two big ones to come. US fans might want to worry a bit more about Raisman. Full leaderboard to come when the floor exercise wraps up in a few minutes. Updated at 4.01pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.57pm EDT 15:57 Odd culture clash here.

Meanwhile, Mustafina’s 15.666 on bars is not quite up to her qualifying standard. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.50pm EDT 15:50 Here goes Mustafina. She looks like she’s about to kill something with a bow and arrow as she attacks the bars. The routine goes quickly, and it’s hard to read her face as she leaves. Good future in poker. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.48pm EDT 15:48 China’s Wang Yan didn’t stick her bars routine in qualifying, scoring 13.9 and not attempting it in the team event. This looks better. Solid landing. But it’s LOWER – 13.733. Tougher judging today? Or just not enough difficulty in the routine? She didn’t get the hang time of Biles or Raisman but seemed fluid.Meanwhile, teammate Shang Chensong has forgotten all about her wayward qualification effort. She’s a picture of precision on the floor exercise. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.45pm EDT 15:45 Remember: This is Biles’ weakest event. Might not beat Mustafina here but wants to limit the damage. And she won’t be returning to this in the apparatus finals. 14.966, actually just a hair lower than the 15 from qualifying but good enough. Simone Biles watches on.

Getting a look now at Shang Chunsong, one of the favorites coming in but well off the pace in qualifying, thanks in part to a 12.766 on the vault.

Her spring isn’t as high as it often is. She hops forward and steps on the landing. She got an unworldly 16.000 in qualifying. Today, 15.866. So even a wobbly landing from Biles barely eats into her margin. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.11pm EDT 15:11 Aly Raisman up now on the vault ... one of the few vaulters who finishes faces forward, and she hops on the finish.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.10pm EDT 15:10 And we’re off, with home favorite Rebeca Andrade flipping up and over the vault. Nice in the air, but the landing was off, with a hop backwards and to the right. She’s just 17. And she’s smiling. And the judges are generous – 15.566!

Here's who has qualified: pic.twitter.com/9KFzAQ9XA7 August 11, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.07pm EDT 14:07 Preamble Hello, and welcome to one of the most-anticipated events of these Games, the women’s all-around gymnastics. Some events at the Olympics are wide-open. Cycling road races turn on the whims of the peloton or the mechanical sturdiness of one’s bike. Any of the top 15 fencers can medal on a given day. This is not one of those events. The all-around is akin to weightlifting, in which only a handful of athletes will even attempt a medal-winning performance. Difficulty is a big part of the scoring, so if you’re only the 12th-best gymnast in the world, you have to hit all your own routines while hoping the seven to eight people trying more difficult routines flop on the mat. The top non-American gymnast in qualifying was from the home country – Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade. She’ll have a legitimate shot at the podium, but the two Russians behind her, Seda Tutkhalian and Aliya Mustafina, are capable as well. But this is, in the most literal sense, the Americans’ event to lose. Consider the qualifying score: Simone Biles 62.366, Aly Raisman 60.607, Andrade 58.732. Those are larger margins than they appear – the gap from third to 30th was smaller than gap from first to third. If you’re in the United States and don’t want the results spoiled before you see them on NBC tonight, you’ll have to stop reading now. Better yet, just open up the live stream in another browser window. Choose the general “women’s all-around final” stream to get the lively commentary – not the same stuff you’ll hear tonight on NBC, but some entertaining and informative former Olympians Jonathan Horton and Courtney Kupets Carter. We won’t tell your boss. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.39am EDT 11:39 Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, read why Simone Biles is making us think again: The Biles back story is an uplifting tale of a fostered child brought up in modest circumstances by a grandfather who indulged her drive to succeed. In terms of her impact on the sport, she represents something else: a return of the quest for perfection. This is the aspect that lifts gymnastics from the sweaty floormats into the philosophical – the search for the perfect routine, balanced between artistry and athletic achievement. In athletics, the four-minute mile and the 10-second 100 metres sprint were once the equivalent ultimate goals. In clock-timed sports, the difference of a split second makes scoring easier. Ice-skating allows for individual differences between judges (older readers will remember the East German judge jokes for giving low scores to any other nations). Gymnastics aggregates scores between the judges on two separate panels to come to final result, often with a fair bit of arguing.

Russian Presidential adviser on Internet development German Klimenko believes that it would be more effective to fine Google not once, but every day until the violation is eliminated, he told TASS on Thursday. "From the standpoint of the international practice, I think daily fines until the violation is eliminated, like in the United States, would have been a more effective measure," he said. "Our goal is not to earn money, but to ensure that the violation has been corrected," Klimenko added. Read also Russian antimonopoly regulator announces $6.7 mln fine for Google Google to study Russian antimonopoly regulator's decision Federation Council approves "Google Tax" bill He said that the US has a method - when judge simply set daily fines for large Internet companies and copyright holders until the violations are removed. "This is a small sum for Google, it incurs greater expenses all around the world - patent wars for example. A sum less than $10 mln is completely insignificant for Google," Klimenko said. Earlier on Thursday, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Agency (FAS) determined the fine in the amount of 438 mln rubles ($6.7 mln) penalty for US Google Corporation. "The fine for breach of antimonopoly laws amounted to 438 mln rubles ($6.7 mln) for Google. We hope the company will perform our decision and pay the fine shortly," Deputy Head of FAS Alexei Dotsenko said. Consultations on a settlement agreement with Google continue despite the announced amount of the fine, press service of FAS told TASS. Opinion Author: Dawson Suzie Dawson Suzie The oppression of the Internet is global Go to Opinions In March 2016, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) initiated administrative proceedings against Google to determine the amount of fine under part 2 article 14.31 of the Russian Code of Administrative Offences. According to the article, in view of the abuse of dominant position on the market of operating systems for mobile devices in Russia, Google as the owner of the Android OS can pay a fine ranging from 1% to 15% of its revenues on the Russian market in 2014. On September 14, 2015, the Federal Antimonopoly Service ruled that Google Inc. and Google Ireland Ltd. had breached the competition protection law under the complaint of the Russian Internet company Yandex. According to the regulator, Google obliged manufacturers of Android OS-based devices to pre-install its applications together with Android platform. FAS said that Google’s policy restricted installation of applications by other developers. Google did not agree with the ruling and appealed to the court. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Topics Russia's domestic policy Top News November 23, 20:19 Diplomat says Moscow never discriminates Western media on its territory November 23, 20:19 November 23, 19:32 German defense minister says no plans for creating EU army November 23, 19:32 November 23, 16:51 Putin says European Parliament’s resolution on Russian media points to degrading democracy November 23, 16:51 November 23, 19:09 Defense Ministry reports militants in eastern Aleppo use civilians as ‘human shield’ November 23, 19:09 In other media Реклама Photo 18 Russian Arctic, the history of exploration 6 Sales of iPhone 7 officially start in Russia 5 First international flight arrives from Minsk at Moscow's newest airport Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 Rally in support to Russian military operation in Syria held outside embassy in London 2 Diplomat says Moscow never discriminates Western media on its territory 3 Steven Seagal arrives in Moscow as new Russian citizen 4 Putin says European Parliament’s resolution on Russian media points to degrading democracy 5 Tsunami reaches Fukushima I NPP in Japan 6 Putin: Fillon differs from other politicians 7 New Su-30, Il-38 planes and other top picks of the Russian Navy this year 1 Lavrov tells Johnson only dialog based on mutual respect can improve Moscow-London ties 2 Army commander assures Russia’s advanced Armata tank has no rivals worldwide 3 Tsunami reaches Fukushima I NPP in Japan 4 Moscow concerned over Croatia’s government decision to set up working group on Ukraine 5 Shanghai Cooperation Organization official says Russia can cope with any sanctions 6 NATO source says deploying missiles to Russian Kaliningrad not to reduce regional tensions 7 New Su-30, Il-38 planes and other top picks of the Russian Navy this year 1 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 2 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 3 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 4 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 5 Russia declines to ratify International Criminal Court Statute 6 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio 7 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

The Pete’s Dragon AR game is the best exercise in dragon spotting The Verge 8/11/2016 Nick Statt © Provided by The Verge To promote the new animated film Pete's Dragon, Disney has teamed up with Google to develop an augmented reality experience in which you seek out a virtual dragon hiding near everyday objects. It's called "Dragon Spotting," and it uses Google's Cloud Vision technology to analyze your environment and blend the dragon Elliott into the scene as viewed through the phone's camera lens. "Dragon Spotting" is accessible via a mobile website starting today, with the film hitting theaters this Friday. Quotes in the article Walt Disney Co DIS ▲ 97.96 +0.25 +0.26% Vision Technology Corp VSTCQ ▼ 0.0000 -0.0010 -99.00% The game uses Cloud Vision's label detection feature to "identify objects in the user’s field of vision, dubbed 'entities,'" according to product manager Ram Ramanathan and Google Zoo director Michael Yapp. (Google Zoo is the company's internal creative team.) From there, the software returns a number of potential entities identified within the shot. The objects can be items around your home, like a piece of furniture, or they can be outdoor entities like trees. "For example, if the user needs to identify 'couch,' the website checks against a list of possible responses: 'chair, futon, couch, sofa,'" the dup wrote. "As soon as the recognized entity matches the desired object, Elliot is revealed." Because iPhone owners can't tap into Google's Cloud Vision in the same way that Android users can, the iOS version of "Dragon Spotting" is less exciting. Instead of working automatically, it asks you to upload pictures of objects to the mobile site to see if Elliot is hiding nearby. Google is able to accomplish this feat by using machine learning to train its image-recognition algorithms, which Cloud Vision taps into before sending the data to the mobile website. This same technology is used to detect the emotions of people in photos, extract text from within photos, identify languages, and automatically moderate images on the web. It's a powerful form of artificial intelligence Google is now using in a variety of ways across its various web services and apps. (Coincidentally, the company's machine learning-focused Google Brain team is doing a Reddit Ask Me Anything later this today.) There couldn't be a more fitting way to promote the new film. Pete's Dragon is a remake of a 1977 classic that was popular at the time for mixing live-action film with animation, with Elliott resembling a cartoon character that exists in the real world. The original Pete's Dragon wasn't the first Disney film to use the technique — the company did it with Mary Poppins a decade prior and with Fantasia back in 1940. Yet the mixing of a virtual character with real world environments is a perfect description of modern-day AR, and the plot of Pete's Dragon specificallyrevolved around that theme.© Provided by The Verge Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From The Verge Miami Beach has run out of sand.

According to the San Jose Mercury News, Google Fiber has put buildouts on hold so it can pursue less expensive alternatives.   Ruth Porat, CFO of Google parent company Alphabet, said on the latest earnings call that Google Fiber is “exploring both fiber and wireless” while referencing Google’s recent acquisition of Webpass, a company that specializes in wireless broadband delivery in markets such as San Francisco, Oakland, San Diego, Miami, Chicago and Boston.   "We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum," an Alphabet spokesperson told Business Insider, the first to report about the FCC filing. "The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers."   According to the filing, Google is eyeing the following markets as potential test locations: Phoenix, Ariz.; Atwater, Los Angeles, Mountain View, Palo Alto , San Bruno and San Francisco, Calif; Boulder, Colo.; Tampa, Fla.; Atlanta, Ga.; Chicago, Ill.; Des Moines, Iowa; Kansas City , Kan.; Omaha, Neb.; Las Vegas, Nev.; New York City; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Portland, Ore.; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; and Blacksburg and Reston, Va.   On the wired end of the business, Google Fiber has launched service in parts of Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Kansas City; and Provo, Utah, and has also committed to deploy in Salt Lake City; San Antonio; and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.  It has also been mulling expansions in Los Angeles; Chicago; Dallas; Portland, Ore.; San Jose, Irvine and San Diego, Calif.; Phoenix; Oklahoma City; Louisville, Ky.; and Jacksonville and Tampa, Fla.   In Atlanta, Google Fiber started off by using existing fiber infrastructure to deliver service to a select batch of apartment buildings. Google Fiber announced via Twitter this week that it has started sign-ups Atlanta for the network it is building there, and set up a deadline of September 29 for the Midtown East and Piedmont Heights areas.

By Maria Lopez August 11, 2016 This article is part of an SEO series from WooRank. Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author How Can Your Site Get into Google Answer Boxes? Retargeting: SEO & PPC Working Together Keyword Research: Finding Local Intent Despite rapidly expanding access to mobile internet (68% of US adults use a smartphone to access the Internet), the concept of mobile SEO has remained relatively traditional. It focuses on building site visibility through improved search ranking. On the surface this makes obvious sense: SEO does stand for “search engine optimization” after all. If you dig a little deeper, however, you learn that it’s time to start focusing on your mobile user experience to improve your site’s mobile friendliness, and letting that drive improvements in your search results rankings. In an effort to make the mobile web more mobile-friendly, Google, along with platforms, publishers and content creators, developed the (AMP) project. AMP is an open source spec initiative designed to create websites that load quickly and provide an enhanced on page experience for users. What Is AMP? There are three basic ingredients that make up an AMP page: HTML: This is basically regular HTML except with a few custom tweaks and limitations. AMP HTML uses custom properties for resources such as images, videos and iframes and a restricted set of technical functions, defined by the open source AMP specs. JavaScript: Probably the most effective part of AMP JS is that it makes all external resources load asynchronously. It also requires you to set sizes in the HTML, which means that the page layout is determined before elements are loaded. This means that elements won’t jump around the page as other resources load. AMP Cache: Google’s AMP Cache is a separate cache used to store AMP pages to serve in search results. When pages stored in the cache are served to a user, everything comes from the same location, increasing efficiency. All three of these elements work together to render pages seemingly instantly. Why You Should Be Using AMP If you’re in the content business — as in, you rely on users viewing and consuming your content — you need AMP. If you rely on organic search traffic to acquire the majority of your users, you also need AMP; Google’s mobile searchers now outnumber their desktop users. Giving your audience near-instant content that is rendered and displayed in a user-friendly format will keep them on your page and encourage them to consume extra content. It might even provide them with a little extra nudge to share it with their friends. Even if you’re not a content creator, perhaps you’re a publisher — you should still consider creating an AMP page. This summer Google rolled out their AMP support for its DoubleClick AdExchange. You can now publish AMP HTML ads that load as quickly as the actual AMP HTML page. Although it’s early days, DoubleClick publishers are already seeing higher estimated CPMs from AMP pages compared with non-AMP. What’s It Mean for SEO? So will AMP pages impact your SEO? The answer to that question is no. But also yes. Earlier this year, a few days after Google officially launched AMP, Webmaster Trends Analyst John Mueller said “Is AMP a ranking signal? At the moment, it is not a ranking signal.” Check out the 15:50 mark of the Google+ Hangout to listen to him talk about AMP. You’ll probably notice that he goes on to discuss how using an AMP page will play into Google’s mobile-friendliness factor. You’re not going to be penalized for having a non-AMP page, and you won’t get a boost simply by using AMP either. But what AMP will do is improve the performance of your site’s mobile version, which has a positive impact on mobile ranking factors. Page Speed There are a lot of signals that go into determining a page’s mobile friendliness, but page speed is one of the most important. In general, people have short attention spans and hate to wait. That impatience increases exponentially when people start using their smartphones: 40% of mobile internet users won’t wait for more than 3 seconds for a page to load. They make up their minds about your page in 50 milliseconds or less. Amazon famously discovered that every second of page load time cost them 1% of their total sales. Google’s mobile-friendliness standard is for above the fold (ATF) content to render in one second or less. So loading your page quickly matters. For non-AMP pages, meeting the one-second ATF requirement is hard work: mobile devices have limited CPU and battery capacity, and after DNS lookups, TCP handshakes and HTTP requests and responses, you’ve got less than half that time to render your whole page. And that doesn’t even take mobile network latency into account. The whole reason Google created the AMP standard is to load pages as close to instantly as possible. This is one of AMP’s major advantages, and probably the biggest impact it will have on your mobile SEO. Using an Accelerated Mobile Page is going to result in very low load times, up to 85% less than normal, according to Google. However, you also get the added bonus of getting your site stored in Google’s AMP Cache. Google stores AMP pages in a dedicated cache and validates and serves pages directly from there, cutting down load time even more. User Experience AMP improves your site’s mobile user experience by connecting your content, brand and/or company to a user during a “micro-moment.” What’s a micro-moment? Micro-moments are the instances in which a person spontaneously and automatically pick up their Internet-enabled device (normally their phone) to fulfill a current need. There are different kinds of micro-moments, each one impacting users’ expectations of and engagement with content. Since AMP-enabled pages are all highly structured in basically the same way, Google can quickly and easily determine relevance to a search keyword and, thanks to Hummingbird, search intent. If you’re using AMP for your page’s mobile version, you’ll have a leg up on other sites in connecting your content to customers at a time when they are most likely to place an order, visit a brick-and-mortar store or research a future purchase. Getting your content in front of a user at this moment is vital to building not only conversions, but brand awareness and loyalty as well. Accelerated Pages have also improved mobile user experience in a very important way: AMP JS controls the entire load chain and prioritizes certain requests over others. This means that the JavaScript loads the main, ATF content first while third-party elements, or content below the fold, start after. Your users are able to start reading immediately after arriving. Since AMP requires height, width and other aspect ratios to be strictly set, it knows ahead of time what your page should look like before anything starts rendering. This eliminates a major source of frustration: page elements jumping around the screen as various resources are loaded. Mobile users are no longer subjected to choppy, partially rendered pages or having their content consumption interrupted by additional slow browser layout calculations. If you have problems with the loading of various page assets interfering with content consumption, an AMP page would allow a significant upgrade to your mobile user experience. Wrapping Up Improvements to user experience can benefit your online business in many different ways: Users will be able to consume more content, improving brand awareness and loyalty Completing an online order is easier and faster, facilitating future purchases Encouraging users to view more content, resulting in higher eCPM and ad loads Connecting with your audience during micro-moments These improvements themselves aren’t signals that Google takes into account when determining mobile search rankings. But they will directly impact on the signals Google does look at: bounce rate, click-through rate, page views and time spent on site. While possible for you to see these benefits, along with increased page speed, through your own on and off page optimizations, using AMP streamlines the whole process and gives Google a strong hint that you have made these improvements. So even though Google’s not directly boosting AMP pages or punishing non-AMP pages, you can expect to see Accelerated Mobile Pages playing a large role in mobile SEO going forward. Do you have an Accelerated Mobile Page? How has it impacted your mobile SEO? Your online business?

Web search engines should adapt to the web it is searching, not the other way around. What if they tried to pull this BS in their first years? Crash & burn. Nope, this it what you do only when you are big enough to force yourself on people. Crap like this, and its SEO collaborators, are slowly ruining the web.

Home Latest News Popular news National International Business Sports Entertainment Science/Tech Environment Feature Bahasa Full Site Nahdlatul Ulama asks Google to put Palestine back on map Jumat, 12 Agustus 2016 01:13 WIB - 0 Views id nahdlatul ulama, google, palestine back on map Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Indonesias largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), has demanded Google to put Palestine on the map, after Google erased Palestine and replaced it with Israel. "It must be brought back on the map," NU Chairman Said Aqil Siroj said here on Thursday. The problem should be addressed soon to prevent it from expanding into a religious sentiment, he added. "If not put back, we will fight," Siroj, alumni of a Mecca university, stated. More than 300 thousand people have signed a petition launched on change.org, calling on Google to recognize Palestine in Google Maps, and to clearly designate and identify the Palestinian territories illegally occupied by Israel. "I boycotted Google yesterday over this, it is totally disgusting and I now believe they arent the only corporation complicit in Israels mass genocide of Palestine," wrote Mark Kavanagh from Birmingham, Britain, who signed the petition initiated by Zak Martin. The omission of Palestine is a grievous insult to the people of Palestine and undermines the efforts of the millions of people who are involved in the campaign to secure Palestinian independence and freedom from Israeli occupation and oppression, Martin wrote. "Whether intentionally or otherwise, Google is making itself complicit in the Israeli governments ethnic cleansing of Palestine," he added. A Google spokeswoman was quoted as saying on the Guardian.com: "There has never been a Palestine label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for West Bank and Gaza Strip. Were working quickly to bring these labels back to the area."(*) Editor: Heru COPYRIGHT © ANTARA 2016 facebook twitter google+ pinterest email Recomended Jakarta Governor attends Santri Day Commemoration 22nd October 2016 Said Aqil among world`s most influential muslim figures 11th October 2016 Google should pay tax in Indonesia 21st September 2016 Pokemon GO can pose security threat to society: Minister Ryacudu 18th July 2016 Ied al-Fitr falls on July 6: Minister Saefuddin 4th July 2016 Google faces record three billion Euro EU antitrust fine: Telegraph 16th May 2016 National International Business Sports Entertainment Science/Tech Environment Feature Copyright © 2016 www.antaranews.com All Rights Reserved

Whether you use it as a makeshift to-do list Reminders Make Google Calendar an Incredible To-Do List Reminders Make Google Calendar an Incredible To-Do List Do you maintain a to-do list and a separate calendar? It introduces friction because tasks and scheduling are interdependent. Google now solved this by introducing Reminders to Google Calendar on Android. Read More , or whether you collaborate on large projects with multiple people via a shared calendar, Google Calendar can fulfill most of your timekeeping needs on its own. Similarly, having a note-saving app like Evernote How To Use Evernote: The Unofficial Manual How To Use Evernote: The Unofficial Manual I see so many advantages to Evernote and we will explore some of them in depth later. But basically it all comes down to this: we are all becoming digital packrats. Read More can be a major time saver. MakeUseOf has a whole guide dedicated to getting the most out of the service, and it ranks with Google Drive and Dropbox as an invaluable storage and archiving solution for everything from your photos and notes to your audio and video files. So what happens when you want to combine the two? Say, that you want to literally save the date whenever you add something to your Google calendar? There are a number of reasons why you might want to sync these two services, and there are an equal number of ways to sync them! Here are a few things you can use to get the most out of both your Evernote account and your Google calendar! Ads by Google Save the Date with 4 Powerful Tools Combining your saved notes with calendar events can be a big time-saver no matter what the occasion. Business meeting events can now have the complete notes or schedules attached for easy perusal. Daily errand reminders on your phone can come with a grocery list from your Evernote. For example, say you’re planning your wedding and are using a shared Google calendar 12 Productive Ideas for a Shared Google Calendar 12 Productive Ideas for a Shared Google Calendar Google Calendar is a phenomenal productivity tool. These 12 ideas should give you some inspiration to start thinking creatively when it comes to Google Calendar. Read More to coordinate events with your guests. Naturally, this will require you to share lots of very specific information that might not fit within the confines of the calendar’s event template. Depending on how elaborate your wedding is, and how many apps and websites you use in the planning, you’ll probably have detailed notes. Suppose you want to share the to-do list or schedule with your party? With the following apps, you can do that and more. If This Then That If This Then That is the name of a “recipe” service that allows you to link your apps and automate your operations The Ultimate IFTTT Guide: Use The Web's Most Powerful Tool Like A Pro The Ultimate IFTTT Guide: Use The Web's Most Powerful Tool Like A Pro IFTTT is an automation that will enable you to connect 2 services so that, when something happens with one service, a trigger goes off and an action takes place automatically on the other. Read More . IFTTT recipes make it very easy to update multiple services at once. But, as we’ve mentioned before, this is the just the tip of the IFTTT iceberg! An IFTTT recipe can be one of the simplest ways to link your Evernote account and your Google Calendar, depending on what you want to do. It can also be very customizable, but if you’re not clear on what you’re doing, it might be confusing. Luckily, there are several ready-made recipes on the site that can get you started. Here’s an IFTTT recipe that will create journal entries for you automatically when you create a new event in your Calendar. Event noted If you want a service that is designed to work within Evernote specifically, and you don’t mind things being a little simple, then Event noted might be the connection you’re looking for. With Event noted, you can create a note with the “Event” tag, and a Calendar event will be created. There is a link in the event to your Evernote journal. You can also add dates to existing notes, making this a simple-yet-powerful tool for those who want to simplify their scheduling. Even noted also links to the note in the calendar description. This is helpful for recording more detailed notes that might not fit in the notes field of your calendar. However, it doesn’t always work. With multiple Calendars synced to the same Google account, it can be very picky.This is because it creates a separate Calendar called “Event noted”. But if you are comfortable with the formatting, Event noted can be a great tool for linking your Calendar to important event notes. Zap It with Zapier Zapier works similarly to IFTTT recipes, automating app tasks to make life easier. It works with a different class of apps, though, and is really well-suited to business tasks. When you want a service designed to work specifically with Slack, Trello, and Salesforce, Zapier should be your first port of call. The app connections offered in Zapier are more customizable than the average IFTTT recipe, so you can usually find what you’re looking for in the existing Zaps. There are almost 300 Zaps for Google Calendar and Evernote alone, though not all of those Zaps connect the two services. Still, almost every combination of trigger and action is available in the Zaps. But in the off-chance you can’t find what you need, you can put together your own Zap. I created a simple Zap that would create an Evernote reminder whenever I make an event in my Google Calendar. There were a lot of different options available, and it’s relatively simple to do. It’s very similar to IFTTT, but one of the biggest differences between the two is that Zapier can automate multi-stepped tasks Create Awesome Life Automations with Multi-Step Zaps Create Awesome Life Automations with Multi-Step Zaps Zapier, the single largest competitor to IFTTT, announced that it now offers users the ability to create multiple action automations called multi-step zaps. Read More , as opposed to just “trigger” and “action” with IFTTT. Zapier comes with a free trial that allows you access to as many tasks and Zaps as you like. After that, you have the option of going with a free plan, which limits the number of Zaps you can use per month, or you can pay for more extensive access. Cronofy Calendar Connector The above options are very useful, but they can all be somewhat complicated. There are other options if you don’t want to have to go through the trouble of setting up a Zap or an IFTTT combination. Cronofy doesn’t offer a great deal of customization, but it still works perfectly and can be a great asset for someone who doesn’t necessarily need a complicated set up to set up an Evernote bridge with Google Calendar. Cronofy connects Evernote with a number of different calendars, including Google Calendar. It creates a Calendar event when you create a reminder in Evernote. You can edit the note by editing the event, and vice versa. It’s much more direct than some of the other services on this page and it’s far from sophisticated, but little details — such as the fact that the event links to the note and any information it contains — can make this a useful shortcut. As a side note, Cronofy offers more extensive services for developers who want to use their calendar integration API for more customization, connection, and for more users. Their starter developer kit is free and works with up to 20 users, and there are pricing plans for those who want to incorporate more users. Do You Need More Customization? If none of the above methods give you quite the control or customization you need, then consider using the Get Things Done Manage Your Tasks Online Using GTD with PlanCake Manage Your Tasks Online Using GTD with PlanCake Read More script available as a Google Apps Script download. There are two benefits to using this script. First, you don’t have to use any third-party software in order to get your two accounts synced. For those concerned about security loopholes with the other apps, this could be the solution. Second, this allows you to have more control over the events and notes created, including what kind of reminder (if any) you get for the event. For those with very specific needs, this script could fill the gap left by all the rest of these programs. However, using this script involves multiple steps and familiarity with Google Apps Script language. I admit that I didn’t grasp the mechanics of using the script, but I wanted to include it on this list for those who do. Have you found connecting Google Calendar and Evernote a time saver?

Remember when maps just showed you what a place looked like? It’s hard to imagine now, but in the mid-2000s that’s basically how it was, before smartphone map apps came along to tell you where to turn, where traffic was backing up, or where to grab a latte en route to your destination. People’s expectations of what information a map can provide have become incredibly detailed, says Jack Menzel, product management director for local search at Google, one of the companies driving the evolution of maps. Now, when people search for a pharmacy or pull it up on Google Maps, they expect to see its hours, and not just its regular hours, but the holiday hours too. “People have this expectation that ‘I want to know that one day a year when their hours are different, and I want to know how they are different.’” The next step, according to Menzel, is to add even more detailed and subjective information—not just which Thai restaurant in the neighborhood gets the best reviews, but whether it has a romantic vibe or is a good place to take the kids. And to do this, the company is asking for users’ help. View Images Clicking on a business in the Google Maps app brings up reviews, photos, and a graph showing times when it’s busy. Map from Google Detailed queries are driving Google, a company built on algorithms and big data, to try a different approach and lean more on users’ local expertise. In recent weeks, the company has rolled out a few software changes to make it easier for users to submit information and vet edits suggested by others. Another recently launched program at Google has recruited millions of people to contribute photos, reviews, and other information about the places where they live. Of course, as those user submissions grow, they’ll likely provide tons of new data that Google’s algorithms can go to work on. It’s not the company’s first foray into crowdsourcing. Map Maker, a program launched in 2008, lets users trace roads on top of satellite imagery and add missing features. And Google didn’t invent collaborative mapping—more than two million people have contributed to OpenStreetMap, a project launched in 2004 to create maps anyone can edit and use for free, making it a popular option for humanitarian groups and other nonprofit organizations.

But Google’s new initiatives are aimed at getting a different kind of information, says Laura Slabin, director for local content and community. “We’re wanting to better understand some of the more subjective picture,” Slabin says. “What’s the vibe of the place? What’s your opinion of the place?” View Images These screenshots show several ways users can contribute information to Google Maps. Images by Greg Miller To that end, the company launched a program called Local Guides back in November to recruit users to submit reviews, answer questions about things like the noise level inside a restaurant, and upload photos of businesses and other places near where they live. To encourage participation, Google offers benefits like increased cloud storage and the opportunity to beta test new products. The most active contributors get a chance to participate in virtual and real-life meet-ups (something the program has in common with Yelp’s events for Elite reviewers). “We felt that we really needed to create a community to help inspire people,” says Slabin, who directs the program. So far more than four million people have signed up; 20 percent have contributed within the last week. View Images Participants in Google’s Local Guide program get points, and potentially rewards, for their contributions. Image from Greg Miller Uploading photos is a big part of the Local Guides program. You might see some of these user-submitted photos if you tap on a business in the Google Maps app. For now it’s up to you to decide if the place looks rowdy or romantic, but in the future you might get an algorithmic assist. “One of the things we’re really excited about as computer vision gets better is how can we make it more assistive to our users,” says Menzel. Google already uses computer vision to extract addresses, street names, and information about which turns are permitted from a given lane from the photos collected by its Street View cameras. In the future, that might extend to interior photos submitted by users, Menzel and Slabin say. “One could imagine if we’re getting a lot of internal photos of a place, and let’s say there’s candlelight; is that a signal that it’s a romantic place or maybe not good for children?” Slabin says. Likewise, Google uses a combination of algorithms and data generated by users to create graphs of when businesses like bars and restaurants are busiest. “We compute popular times just like we compute traffic—based on the anonymized aggregated movement of people that we receive through location reporting,” says Elizabeth Davidoff, communications manager for Google Maps. “We've built up an anonymized aggregated history of what foot and car traffic is usually like on specific roads or at specific places at certain times that enables us to predict how traffic will change over time.” (Users concerned about privacy can opt out of location tracking). Getting more data from users is the only way to meet the growing expectation that Google can answer any question, no matter how trivial, and no matter where you are, says Menzel. “The only way to answer everybody’s questions is to get people engaged in sharing what they know about their community, their part of the world.” Comment on This Story © 1996-Thu Nov 17 23:46:19 EST 2016 National Geographic Society.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Aug 11, 2016 at 1:22PM If only Twitter earnings were as delicious as these cupcakes. Image source: Twitter. Copyright Asa Mathat for Twitter, Inc. The first quarter is usually a down one for most digital advertising companies. It's the point where they reset for the year after marketers make a big holiday push in the fourth quarter. That trend can be seen in both Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and it's even more pronounced in the United States overall. But those companies usually grow revenue sequentially in the second quarter, and often revenue can surpass the levels seen in the fourth quarter. That was the case for both Google and Facebook this year, but Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) failed to surpass its fourth-quarter advertising revenue in Q2. Most devastating is that U.S. ad revenue declined from $343 million in Q1 to $313 million in Q2, even while active users increased in the country, with the company saying it was at 65 million U.S. monthly active users in Q1 and 66 million in Q2. However, it's unlikely Twitter actually added 1 million net new users in the United States last quarter. Because of the way the company rounds its active users to the nearest million, these numbers are bound to be off to a certain degree. A massive decline in domestic ARPU Twitter doesn't break out average revenue per user (ARPU), which leaves me to do a little math. Dividing the $313 million U.S. advertising revenue by the 66 million monthly active users reveals that Twitter generated $4.74 in ad revenue per domestic user in the second quarter. That's a 10% decrease from the $5.28 per user during the first quarter and a 25% decline from the fourth quarter's $6.31. If Twitter had merely met its fourth-quarter ARPU levels, it would have boosted revenue by over $100 million. By comparison, Facebook saw its average advertising revenue in the U.S. and Canada climb 16% sequentially last quarter to $13.74. That's also a 5% improvement over the fourth quarter's $13.06 per user that the company brought in. The problem is most pronounced in the United States for Twitter, but it's not completely immune outside the U.S., either. International advertising ARPU failed to reach the same level Twitter saw in the fourth quarter, too. Last quarter, the number fell to $0.90 from $0.95 in the fourth quarter. By comparison, Facebook saw an increase in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter for every geographic region. What management had to say Twitter's management has an explanation, albeit not a very good one. There are two factors affecting the decline in revenue. The first is an explanation for slower growth, as Twitter's largest portion of ad revenue comes from direct sales to large brand advertisers. Twitter is no longer growing the number of brands it does business with and is now focused on driving average revenue per advertiser. So it's transitioning from two growth drivers to just one. The second factor, and the main reason for the decline in revenue, says Twitter, is those marketers transitioning from promoted tweets to promoted videos. "We've had a couple of quarters now where they move from traditional promoted tweets into our video ad products," CFO Anthony Noto told analysts on the company's earnings call. "In general, we view the shift into video as a good thing, but it's a multi-quarter approach." But there's no clear explanation as to why marketers would spend less on video ads compared with promoted tweets. After all, management believes video ads are more valuable to those businesses compared with its promoted tweets. It wouldn't be making the transition otherwise. In the company's letter to shareholders, it noted, "... it will take time for marketers to understand the impact of video ads on mobile vs. the alternative." Advertisers have been buying mobile video ads from Facebook and Google for several quarters now, though, and Facebook hasn't seen a dramatic negative impact on its ad revenue or even its ad prices. In fact, Facebook's ad prices continue to climb. What does that mean? There are a few takeaways from management's comments. The first is that it's probably pricing video ads too high. Management made several comments about its ad pricing during the earnings call and in its letter to shareholders. It also changed how it counts a video view, lowering the requirements, in an effort to move its pricing more in line with the rest of the industry. Second, it's not increasing its share of U.S. brand advertisers' budgets. Even as more ad dollars shift from old print media to digital, those dollars are going to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube before advertisers look at Twitter. The companies behind those products are heavily invested in mobile video, and Twitter's product looks like a me-too implementation with a less engaged audience. That could change this fall, as Twitter rolls out its new live-streaming content, including 10 Thursday night football games. Twitter is making a big bet on live-streaming premium content, and the transition to video ads now, even if it's losing ad dollars in the process, could pay off in the long run. That's another big bet, and only investors willing to accept that kind of risk should be holding on to Twitter stock. In the meantime, investors can expect continued struggles in the third quarter, as the company forecast no revenue growth sequentially -- indicating another domestic ad revenue decline offset by international growth.

The cloud services that Google uses to power its own services are second to none. But for the longest time, the company couldn’t get a foothold in the quickly growing cloud computing business while competitors like Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft Azure were growing rapidly. To right this ship, Google brought in Diane Greene by acquiring her startup BeBop Technologies for $348 million last year and named her its VP of Google Cloud Enterprise. Greene will join us at Disrupt SF in September to talk about Google’s ambitions in the cloud and how she plans to bring more enterprises onto Google’s platform. Few people have Greene’s experience in the enterprise. Before striking out on her own again with bebop, she was the CEO of VMware, where she oversaw deals like that company’s acquisition by EMC. She shepherded VMware through its IPO in 2007 and then left in 2008. Greene joined Google’s board of directors in 2012, so she’s no stranger to the company and its overall vision. “It is Google’s time for enterprise,” she told our own Ron Miller in an interview earlier this year. “Google has a lot to offer the world and it all came together in a nice way. There was just a lot of effort going on around the enterprise that has set things up really well.” With Google now putting its massive resources behind expanding its enterprise offerings, this will surely be an interesting conversation on our Disrupt stage. Disrupt SF is returning to Pier 48; early-bird tickets are still available, though the sale ends soon. Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.

Frequently covers franchise news and food trends. 20 Questions 12 Entrepreneurs Share the Books They Always Recommend Nina Zipkin Make More Happen The One Thing This Entrepreneur Does Each Day to Stay Productive Nina Zipkin Make More Happen This Founder Says to Succeed You Need to Question Everything Nina Zipkin ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 11, 2016 Editor’s Note: Entrepreneur’s “20 Questions” series features both established and up-and-coming entrepreneurs and asks them a number of questions about what makes them tick, their everyday success strategies and advice for aspiring founders. Traveling all over the world may seem like a glamorous dream come true. But the shimmer of exotic cities can dim pretty quickly if on your own. There’s no one to share a bite of a delicious dish, smile with you at the end of a hiking excursion or keep you company during a plane delay. Richard Pleeth feels your pain. Having previously worked at Google and New York City car app Gett, Pleeth racked up his frequent flyer miles globetrotting all over the world. In 2014 alone, he took 74 flights. To try and connect with his friends, he would continually check in on Facebook in hopes of meeting up with them. But there was always a one or two day delay in between, even when he was home in London. Related: The CEO of Billion-Dollar Startup Gusto Believes Passion Should Come Before Revenue To help remedy the problem, Pleeth created an app called Sup to help folks more easily connect and meet up with friends (without the creep stalker factor that some other apps may secrete.) Sup connects to social media and simply sends a quick notification when friends are nearby -- about a five, 15 or 25 minute walk away. You have the option to reach out if you feel like meeting up and even send out a notification if you’re lonely and fancy a friend or two. “We all use a bunch of social networks, but they all make us less social,” Pleeth says. “We spend more time looking at our screens, adding filters to photos or looking through newsfeeds, rather than being out meeting our friends.” Image credit: Sup Having just launched in November, the app -- with a focus more on the in-person connection, rather than online -- has already snagged $1 million in funding and has more than 50,000 users. We reached out to the app’s founder to check out how this entrepreneur gets through the day and advice he has for others. 1. How do you start your day? I reach for my phone to see what I missed while I was asleep. I check all the news sites, my social feeds and do as many emails as possible while in bed. I find this means I'm fully informed for the day and helps me relax a little before having to get up. Then it’s up to the shower where I have some time to think about everything I have just taken in and wake up properly before heading to my first meetings. 2. How do you end your day? I have a lot of events to attend in the evenings, so the timing of the end of my day varies. It's super important to attend as many as possible to really get out and network, meet investors and press. I also call my 97-year-old grandma each evening to check how her day was as she likes to hear me from me. Lastly, I finish all my emails, I try and operate inbox zero, which I think is a really healthy way to work. I then usually get into bed with my phone to read some blogs and have a catch up with friends. 3. What’s a book that changed your mind and why? Purple Cow by Seth Godin. He makes you think, take a step back and see how you can make your product stand out -- make it something people want to talk about and have in their lives. 4. What’s a book you always recommend and why? How Google Works by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg. They really hit the points home here on how Google has become the most valuable company in the world. It’s really useful understanding how to innovate, stay nimble and build a winning team. 5. What’s a strategy to keep focused? I have a very clear to-do list each day. I call it my “Master Sheet,” and it’s a Google spreadsheet with columns for today, this week, next week, this month, along with ongoing and separate columns for other issues such as PR and fundraising. I make sure I know exactly what I have to do each day and ensure I can cross each one off, so nothing gets dropped. Related: How to Stay Focused: Train Your Brain 6. When you were a kid what did you want to be when you grew up? A lifeguard, just like in Baywatch. I loved swimming and the beach, so I related to that a lot. I was intrigued by the independence of being a lifeguard and having flexibility while having a lot of fun. Also who doesn't want to be a hero? 7. What did you learn from the worst boss you ever had? You need to encourage your team, never take credit for other individuals work, be consistent and take responsibility for your decisions. 8. Who has influenced you most when it comes to how you approach your work? It’s not really one person, but it’s the people I worked with at Google. I learned so much and came to admire so many people at the company who are among the most ambitious, intelligent and personable people I have ever met. 9. What’s a trip that changed you? In 2013 I travelled to North Korea for four days, and it was fascinating. I’m passionate about everyone having access to unmoderated internet and access to information. North Korea is so far away from that, and it really made me think the whole time I was there. Now three years later, I think back to the people I met, the questions they asked and how their lives would be so much better with access to information. 10. What inspires you? People being better than me at everything. There are a lot of them. I’m not particularly good at anything, I’m just immensely curious about everything I come in contact with. 11. What was your first business idea and what did you do with it? I sold shells I found on the beach to my family. The margins were phenomenal, but it didn’t really lead to great lengths. 12. What was an early job that taught you something important or useful? I was a sailing instructor while at school. It was fun, but it really taught me how to lead the other sailing instructors, teach all the students and ensure everyone was having fun, safe and learning to sail. 13. What’s the best advice you ever took? Never stop learning. 14. What's the worst piece of advice you ever got? Give up. Related: 7 Tools to Increase Productivity and Efficiency 15. What’s a productivity tip you swear by? Put everything in your calendar -- personal stuff, work stuff -- so the time when you are free, your team can book or put in meetings. Then be super disciplined with meetings. Make sure you are achieving a goal. 16. Is there an app or tool you use in a surprising way to get things done or stay on track? I use Google Spreadsheets as my to-do list. I find it's super effective as you can login from anywhere and it's all synced. I can move items from today, to this week, to next week, and I can track exactly what I need to do. I also obviously use my calendar to track everything. Google Calendar is brilliant and syncs with my emails and browser so I can ensure that I am where I need to be. 17. What does work-life balance mean to you? As a founder you are always on. I try and reply to all emails immediately to let people know I am on it and will get back to them with more detail later. I think it’s important to have a lot of fun in what you do professionally. Outside of work I have the most fantastic friends, who I spend a lot of time with and are there to support me. We have a good party, which balances out the intense work. 18. How do you prevent burnout? I love what I do. I work with an amazing team, so work doesn’t feel like work. Do things you love, and you’ll avoid that dreaded burnout. 19. When you’re faced with a creativity block, what’s your strategy to get innovating? You’ve got to get out of the office. The days when you are unmotivated or blocked, the first thing you need to do is acknowledge it, and then do something about it.  If I am really blocked, I stop work, play Xbox, table tennis, go to the park, go to a museum or phone a friend. Then I am so ready to hit the ground running. Related: Weebly's Founder Explains the Richard Branson Moment That Changed How He Ran His Company 20. What are you learning now? I learn so much every day. I’m always inspired by my team and my friends who are all incredibly intelligent and significantly smarter than me. By surrounding yourself with smart people you will always be learning. I’m a huge fan of NYU Stern Professor Scott Galloway and ensure I keep up with all his courses that are on YouTube or in presentations.   Lindsay Friedman Lindsay Friedman is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

We are already expecting to see the final iteration of Google Assistant, which was unveiled at Google I/O 2016, but we are continuing to see new leaks and features being rolled out to select users. The last week or two have been a leak-a-palooza for Google, its software, and the upcoming Nexus devices, and we might not be done just yet. There have even been a few new features rolled into Google Now itself, including the “Explore Interests” cards. The latest set of changes is the addition of a “Dashboard” option found within Google Now. Currently when opening Google Now, you aren’t presented with any options other than the hamburger menu in the top left hand corner. However, a few screenshots have surfaced which show two selections at the bottom of the display. On the left, we see a “G” for the Home aspect, which presumably will take you back to the main Google Now screen when selected, while on the right is a new “Dashboard” option. Courtesy of Android Police According to Android Police, this new Dashboard only works with those using the Nexus Launcher and “collects data from across the different Google services and pools them all in the tab.” This means that we could soon have a place to access all of our to-do lists, calendar events, and emails from a single destination. Google Now already displays relevant information, but only if the events are coming up, or a task is due soon, other than that we have to rely on opening the different apps to access the information. As for what the Dashboard will include, one of the folks who received this server-side update, states that it contains information from Google services such as the Calendar and reminders entered into Google Keep. We are inching closer to the release of not only Android Nougat, but also the unveiling of the 2016 devices. It’s probable that this new feature is tied to the Nexus Launcher, but we’ll have to wait and see when the final product is shown off later this year.

In case you’re unaware, Google has a dream of delivering broadband internet to homes without having to run wire directly to the units. This feat can be achieved thanks to spectrums in the range of 3.4GHz to 3.8GHz. In Layman’s terms, you’ll get internet that’s nearly as fast and reliable as using a fiber-optic hookup without the ugly cable to go with them. Wondering if your city will part of those testing rounds whenever Google gets this stuff off the ground? Here are 12 that they’ve detailed in their filling: Atwater, California Mountain View, California Palo Alto, California San Bruno, California San Francisco, California San Jose, California Boulder, Colorado Kansas City, Kansas Omaha, Nebraska Raleigh, North Carolina Provo, Utah Reston, Virginia. As you might notice, the list of disclosed city largely makes up current cities where Fiber is already operational. The other cities are those where Google’s fiber deployment has been delayed. It’s say to say if Google can run fiber in a city, they want to provide wireless access, too. Of course, testing is testing, and we’re not sure how long this project could take to come to full fruition, so we’ll have to wait and see how the story unfolds from here on out. local_offer    Google   Google Fiber   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (62) stars Further Reading Verizon offering Pixel for $10 a month DEAL: Google is dropping $30 off of Googel Home Google WiFi may be the best router Google updates the YouTube app with a new icon and more Google Shops are launching in Canada and the UK stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertPokémon GO makes big changes CP levels closePokémon GO is making big changes to the CP levels of your favorite Pokémon Pokemon GO is bring big changes to the balancing of the game by tweaking the CP levels of some of your favorite Pokemon (for better or worse). 2 more_vertHTC may exit the mobile smartphone market closeHTC may be looking to get out of the smartphone business A new rumor suggests that HTC may be planning to sell off its mobile division due to suffering too many losses. 3 more_vertDitto is now live in Pokémon GO, here's how to catch him closeDitto is officially live in Pokémon GO, here’s how to catch him Today, Niantic has officially released Ditto into the augmented wilds of Pokemon GO.

I can move items from today, to this week, to next week, and I can track exactly what I need to do. I also obviously use my calendar to track everything. Google Calendar is brilliant and syncs with my emails and browser so I can ensure that I am where I need to be. 17. What does work-life balance mean to you? As a founder you are always on. I try and reply to all emails immediately to let people know I am on it and will get back to them with more detail later. I think it’s important to have a lot of fun in what you do professionally. Outside of work I have the most fantastic friends, who I spend a lot of time with and are there to support me. We have a good party, which balances out the intense work. 18. How do you prevent burnout? I love what I do. I work with an amazing team, so work doesn’t feel like work. Do things you love, and you’ll avoid that dreaded burnout. 19. When you’re faced with a creativity block, what’s your strategy to get innovating? You’ve got to get out of the office. The days when you are unmotivated or blocked, the first thing you need to do is acknowledge it, and then do something about it.  If I am really blocked, I stop work, play Xbox, table tennis, go to the park, go to a museum or phone a friend. Then I am so ready to hit the ground running. Related: Weebly's Founder Explains the Richard Branson Moment That Changed How He Ran His Company 20. What are you learning now? I learn so much every day. I’m always inspired by my team and my friends who are all incredibly intelligent and significantly smarter than me. By surrounding yourself with smart people you will always be learning. I’m a huge fan of NYU Stern Professor Scott Galloway and ensure I keep up with all his courses that are on YouTube or in presentations.   Lindsay Friedman Lindsay Friedman is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

A new FCC filing by Google shows that it’s planning to experiment with 3.5GHz spectrum that will help relieve Wi-Fi congestion and improve consumer experience when accessing the internet over wireless broadband. Google has requested that FCC that it be given permission for experimenting with the 3.4 to 3.8MHz frequency range in 24 areas in the United States, including but not limited to San Francisco, Mountain View, Boulder, and Omaha. However, it doesn’t look like Google will be relying on the general public too much when it starts running tests. It says in the filing that tests will be conducted by Google’s contractors and employees while it may allow select “trusted testers” to take a go at it as well under close supervision. Google isn’t revealing any more information about its wireless broadband plans at this point in time so it could be a few months before we find out more about this. A wireless broadband service from Google will nicely complement the Google Fiber service that’s slowly gaining ground across the United States. Filed in General.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Google fined £5M for breaking Russia’s antitrust law with Android Ad giant ordered to loosen restrictions on Android device makers after Yandex complaint. by Jennifer Baker - Aug 11, 2016 3:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 95 Tony Avelar/Bloomberg via Getty Images Google has been fined more than £5 million (438 million rubles, $6.8 million) and told to slacken limits it places on device makers by Russian authorities who found that the search and ad giant had breached competition rules with its Android mobile operating system. On Thursday, the country's Federation Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) said that Google forced mobile phone manufacturers to include Google search on the home screen of all Android devices and bundling other services with Google Play, while preventing manufacturers from pre-installing competing services. The case was opened in February 2014, when one of those rivals, Yandex, filed an official complaint against Google. Last year, the authorities decided that it had broken Russian competition law. The ruling was upheld again in March, when Google lost an appeal. FAS said in a statement that Russian law applies to all companies operating in the country. The fine—standing at almost £5.25 million—is small change compared to the Internet behemoth’s $74.5 billion global annual turnover. Russian authorities may only fine up to 15 percent of domestic earnings. “We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyse it closely before deciding our next steps. In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia,” said Google's press office. Google faces similar antitrust charges in the European Union, where potential penalties are more severe. In April, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent a Statement of Objections to the company saying Google had abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device makers and ordering it to clean up its act or face a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual turnover. While Russia's fine against Google is tiny, an order from the FAS demanding that the ad giant change the restrictions it places on device makers in the country could prove to be more damaging. Google is appealing against the order, with a hearing scheduled for August 16. This story was updated after publication with comment from Google.

This time it's Bill Maris, founder and chief executive officer of Google Ventures (GV), the venture capital investment arm of Alphabet that provides seed, venture, and growth stage funding to "bold new companies." Maris is the third high ranking executive to leave an Alphabet company in the past several months, which could be seen as an indicator transitioning to a new corporate structure isn't working out all that well. However, Maris said his decision was about wanting to spend more time with his infant son and wife. "I have an 11-month-old son and a wife. And I legitimately want to spend more time with them," Maris told Recode in an interview. It's mission accomplished for me. Eight years is long than I though I would spend. GV is seen as a premier venture capital operation around the world. If it weren't in great shape, that would be the wrong time to leave. I'm leaving because everything is great." He's also leaving because he needs "some quiet and some solitude and some time" to get his creative juices flowing. Maris estimates that a month or two away from the hustle and bustle will give him the time he needs to "incubate some ideas." He's not sure what will result from his creative process, but "you should definitely expect something from me. I'm not just going to go on the beach this week." Apart from spending time with his family and coming up with new ideas, Maris stated he needed a break from the anxiety that came from keeping his phone on all the time for eight years. He felt that if he wasn't reachable, he was disappointing someone, a notion that comes with the territory of him being the ultimate decider on things at GV. As for the changes at Alphabet, Maris is adamant that his departure has nothing to do with GV's parent company. He says the the change to Alphabet didn't have much impact on GV and that it's remained independent since the day it was founded.

SUBSCRIBE Google Search Console reporting glitch shows no links for some webmasters No need to panic -- the link report in the Google Search Console seems to have a few kinks that Google is working out. Barry Schwartz on August 11, 2016 at 8:37 am More There are many reports from webmasters saying that the “Links to Your Site” within the Google Search Console shows them no data. I have confirmed the bug, which is impacting many webmasters, but not all. Here is a screen shot of what some webmasters may see in the Google Search Console links report: Again, for some reason, this is not impacting all webmasters. I am personally able to see data for some sites and not see any data for other sites that I have access to in my Google Search Console account. Google is aware of the issue, and Google’s John Mueller told me that the team is “looking at it.” @rustybrick we’re looking at it, thanks! — John Mueller (@JohnMu) August 11, 2016 In any event, just be aware this seems to be a widespread issue and is likely nothing webmasters need to be concerned about. It is likely just a reporting glitch within the Google Search Console.

SUBSCRIBE Why links are still the core authority signal in Google’s algorithm Link metrics have been the foundation of Google’s ranking algorithm since the beginning, but could anything ever surpass links as a ranking signal? Columnist Jayson DeMers speculates. Jayson DeMers on August 11, 2016 at 9:46 am More It’s almost impossible to see any meaningful search engine optimization (SEO) results without spending some time building and honing your inbound link profile. Of the two main deciding factors for site rankings (relevance and authority), one (authority) is largely dependent on the quantity and quality of links pointing to a given page or domain. As most people know, Google’s undergone some major overhauls in the past decade, changing its SERP layout, offering advanced voice-search functionality and significantly revising its ranking processes. But even though its evaluation of link quality has changed, links have been the main point of authority determination for most of Google’s existence. Why is Google so dependent on link metrics for its ranking calculations, and how much longer will links be so important? The concept of PageRank To understand the motivation here, we have to look back at the first iteration of PageRank, the signature algorithm of Google Search named after co-founder Larry Page. It uses the presence and quality of links pointing to a site to determine how to gauge a site’s authoritativeness. Let’s say there are 10 sites, labeled A through J. Every site links to site A, and most sites link to site B, but the other sites don’t have any links pointing to them. In this simple model, site A would be far likelier to rank for a relevant query than any other site, with site B as a runner-up. But let’s say there are two more sites that enter the fray, sites K and L. Site L is linked to from sites C, D and E, which don’t have much authority, but site K is linked to from site A, which has lots of authority. Even though site K has fewer links, the higher authority link matters more — and might propel site K to a similar position as site A or B. The big flaw PageRank was designed to be a natural way to gauge authority based on what neutral third parties think of various sites; over time, in a closed system, the most authoritative and trustworthy sites would rise to the top. The big flaw is that this isn’t a closed system; as soon as webmasters learned about PageRank, they began cooking up schemes to manipulate their own site authority, such as creating link wheels and developing software that could automatically acquire links on hundreds or thousands of unsuspecting websites at the push of a button. This undermined Google’s intentions and forced them to develop a series of checks and balances. Increasing phases of sophistication Over the years, Google has cracked down hard on such rank manipulators, first punishing the most egregious offenders by blacklisting or penalizing anyone participating in a known link scheme. From there, they moved on to more subtle developments that simply refined the processes Google used to evaluate link-based authority in the first place. One of the most significant developments was Google Penguin, which overhauled the quality standards Google set for links. Using more advanced judgments, Google could now determine whether a link appeared “natural” or “manipulative,” forcing link-building tactics to shift while not really overhauling the fundamental idea behind PageRank. Other indications of authority Of course, links aren’t the only factor responsible for determining a domain or page’s overall authority. Google also takes the quality of on-site content into consideration, thanks in part to the sophisticated Panda update that rewards sites with “high-quality” (well-researched, articulate, valuable) content. The functionality of your site, including its mobile-friendliness and the availability of content to different devices and browsers, can also affect your rankings. But it’s all these factors together that determine your authority, and links are still a big part of the overall mix. Modern link building and the state of the web Today, link building must prioritize the perception of “naturalness” and value to the users encountering those links. That’s why link building largely exists in two forms: link attraction and manual link building. Link attraction is the process of creating and promoting valuable content in the hope that readers will naturally link to it on their own, while manual link building is the process of placing links on high-authority sources. Even though marketers are, by definition, manipulating their rankings whenever they do anything known to improve their rankings, there are still checks and balances in place that keep these tactics in line with Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. Link attraction tactics won’t attract any links unless the content is worthy of those links, and manual link-building tactics won’t result in any links unless the content is good enough to pass a third-party editorial review. The only sustainable, ongoing manual link-building strategy I recommend is guest blogging, the process by which marketers develop relationships with editors of external publications, pitch stories to them, and then submit those stories in the hope of having them published. Once published, these stories achieve myriad benefits for the marketer, along with (usually) a link. Could something (such as social signals) replace links? Link significance and PageRank have been the foundation for Google’s evaluation of authority for most of Google’s existence, so the big question is: could anything ever replace these evaluation metrics? More user-centric factors could be a hypothetical replacement, such as traffic numbers or engagement rates, but user behavior is too variable and may be a poor indication of true authority. It also eliminates the relative authority of each action that’s currently present in link evaluation (i.e., some users wouldn’t be more authoritative than others). Peripheral factors like content quality and site performance could also grow in their significance to overtake links as a primary indicator. The challenge here is determining algorithmically whether content is high-quality or not without using links as a factor in that calculation. Four years ago, Matt Cutts squelched that notion, stating at SMX Advanced 2012, “I wouldn’t write the epitaph for links just yet.” Years later, in a Google Webmaster Video from February 2014, a user asked if there was a version of Google that excludes backlinks as a ranking factor. Cutts responded: We have run experiments like that internally, and the quality looks much, much worse. It turns out backlinks, even though there’s some noise and certainly a lot of spam, for the most part, are still a really, really big win in terms of quality of our search results. So we’ve played around with the idea of turning off backlink relevance, and at least for now, backlink relevance still really helps in terms of making sure that we return the best, most relevant, most topical set of search results. The safe bet is that links aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. They’re too integrated as a part of the web and too important to Google’s current ranking algorithm to be the basis of a major overhaul. They may evolve over the next several years, but if so, it’ll certainly be gradual, so keep link building as a central component of your SEO and content marketing strategy.

SUBSCRIBE The 4 daily habits of the most successful SEOs Want to be great at search engine optimization? Columnist John Lincoln believes that this requires more than just deep SEO knowledge -- it's about building good habits, too. John E Lincoln on August 11, 2016 at 11:19 am More If you want to be a successful SEO, it’s a great idea to imitate your peers who are ranking sites and making their clients happy. After all, the reason that many SEOs are successful is that they’ve cultivated professional habits that other SEOs haven’t. So what are those habits? Here are a few of them. 1. They study the news and strategy like crazy Few things change more than SEO. It seems as though every week, we read about a new algorithm update or a change that Google is testing. That’s why it’s important that you keep up with the latest news in SEO. Otherwise, you’re going to miss important tidbits of information that will help you rank your clients’ sites. Fortunately, there are plenty of channels online where you can get the info you need to keep up with all that’s happening in search engine optimization. A few blogs to follow: Google Webmaster Central: Did you know that Google has a blog? Even better, that blog is designed specifically for webmasters and SEOs who want to help their clients do well in Google search. Bookmark that site, and make it a point to browse through it at least once a week. You’ll gain some great insight about what the Big G is up to. Search Engine Land: Another “must bookmark” for all digital marketers is Search Engine Land. It’s a sister publication to Marketing Land, so it’s a great site to read regularly if you’re interested in the whole spectrum of digital marketing. It also lives up to its name by providing great insights into SEO. Search Engine Roundtable: Simply put, there’s nothing that’s going to happen in SEO that won’t be reported on Search Engine Roundtable. The authors on that site closely monitor SEO news feeds, Google Webmaster Central, and even the social media accounts of key players in the game. You should definitely bookmark the site to keep up with the latest buzz in search engine optimization. Moz Blog: Another great place to get tips about SEO, as well as information on digital marketing in general, is the Moz blog. Whether you’re looking for copywriting tips, advice on SEO data analysis or sales funnel optimization techniques, you’ll find it there. SEMrush Blog: Almost all great digital marketing companies have a blog, because the people who run those companies know about the importance of content marketing. SEMrush is no exception. Bookmark that blog to gain some insight on optimization techniques and keyword analysis and pointers on how to develop killer content. Also, there is a lot to learn about SEO on YouTube. I recommend Google Webmaster Central office-hours hangouts with John Mueller, weekly Search Video Recaps with Barry Schwartz and the Moz video channel. Also, don’t forget about Whiteboard Friday if you are into video education. Finally, I am no Rand Fishkin, but I like to think my SEO training video series is well worth watching. Bottom line here: You’re never “done” learning about SEO. It’s a fluid environment, so be sure that you always keep up with the latest changes. 2. They review what’s working with analytics and ranking tools Some SEOs let their personal feelings and biases trump the numbers. That’s a bad habit. You might think that you “know” what will work for a particular client, but if your tools and analytics are telling you that your pet technique isn’t doing the job, then it’s time to look at other options. Good SEO professionals make it a habit to review the sites at the top of the search engines and figure out what got them there. They then take their hypotheses, test them and implement the winning techniques for clients. Personally, I like to look at the SEMrush winners and losers report and then analyze the websites at the top. 3. They act instead of just talking or strategizing You can keep up with the latest news, check out how your competitors are ranking, and invest in all the SEO tools you can afford, but it won’t matter if you don’t put action to your knowledge. Great SEOs don’t just theorize. They act. Successful SEOs aren’t given to analysis paralysis. Instead, they find out what they need to do and put a plan in action that moves their clients’ websites up in the SERPs. This one is a big one for me. You can come up with strategies all day, but if the changes never go live online, it was all for nothing. So a good SEO knows how to push a project through. I recommend taking the following steps when you want to get a project approved and implemented quickly: Present the project along with analytics backing the potential gains. Create a compelling case that shows the return on investment. Submit technical requirements in a format that can be immediately used by developers. Set a timeline and follow up regularly. 4. They are always improving their skills and websites Whether they are looking to improve the quality of content on a website, the backlink profile, their technical knowledge or their communication skills, the best SEO experts never stop looking for ways to better themselves and their online search rankings. SEO is a very large and complicated field, demanding many skills, so the leaders in the field are naturally those who have continued to work hard over time.

The Federal Antimonopoly Service in September last year deemed Google in breach of a law on “protecting competition” after an investigation following a complaint by Russia’s largest search engine, Yandex. Yandex asked the FAS to prevent Android phones from being automatically bundled with Google’s search engine. The FAS said Google has two months to pay the fine. Yelena Zayeva, the head of its department for regulating communications and IT, was quoted in the statement as saying the ruling “will allow the development of competition on the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive effect for consumers.” All companies whose production is on sale in Russia have to observe the law on competition, “including transnational corporations,” Zayeva added. Google said in a statement sent to AFP: “We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps.” “In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia,” Google said. Google’s Android operating system takes 80 percent of the smartphone market.

The next time you start typing in the course domain you’ll see the actual URL you want in the omnibar list and can click on it. My own tactic is to use the bookmarks bar as a launcher for all my favorite web apps, by simply bookmarking the site and editing the bookmark to remove the name, so it’s just the favicon showing. The rest of my bookmarks are in folders and sub-folders, with the top-level folders well chosen so I can separate work from play and easily find whatever I need.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Another Key High-Ranking Google Executive Just Quit August 11, 2016 12:45pm Nasdaq:GOOGL ShareTweet The exodus of top-level talent from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues. This time, it’s Bill Maris, who founded and serves as CEO of Alphabet’s venture capital unit who’s hitting the bricks. From Bloomberg: David Krane, a managing partner at the firm formerly known as Google Ventures, will succeed Maris as head of the group, a person familiar with the matter said. Krane, a 17-year veteran of Google, will likely increase the firm’s investments in consumer products and services, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details aren’t public. Maris created Google Ventures in 2009. While the firm is funded entirely by Alphabet, GV operates like a traditional venture capital outfit by encouraging partners to make investments with the goal of big financial returns, not finding prospective acquisitions for its parent company. GV now has 14 partners, each of whom receive a piece of the returns from the funds they work on. This move is a huge loss for Google, which has had a lot of success in the venture capital arena under Maris. GV was the most active U.S. corporate venture arm in the first half of the year, according to research firm CB Insights. Its largest investment is Uber Technologies Inc., and its holdings also include Slack Technologies Inc. and Jet.com Inc., the e-commerce startup that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. agreed to buy for about $3 billion. GV manages $2.4 billion and has about 70 employees, most of whom help startups design, develop and market their products. Maris is the latest in a line of several high-ranking Google execs to leave the company recently. In recent months, Alphabet has lost several high-profile executives, including Chris Urmson, a key engineer at its self-driving car initiative, and Tony Fadell, who ran its Nest home appliance business. Maris is expected to discuss his departure with GV staff on Thursday, saying he plans to spend more time with his wife and baby, said the person familiar with the matter. Before joining Google, Maris worked at Swedish firm Investor AB managing biotechnology investments. He founded and sold Burlee, a web hosting business. The true reasons behind Maris’ departure weren’t immediately known, but he noted he’d be taking some time off before embarking on his next journey. It’s not a stretch to think that he’ll stick in the VC space, probably in a firm that will compete against Google for investment placements. Alphabet shares, which have gained 4% year-to-date, rose $0.94 (+0.12%) to $809.43 in Thursday afternoon trading.

But Google doesn’t really like building Google’s fast internet, because it costs a lot of money, takes a lot of time, and is logistically complicated to build and maintain. One answer to that problem? Taking the wires out of the equation. As Business Insider spotted, Google’s very much focused on going wireless if it can. And not in the sense of challenging AT&T or Verizon in the cell phone space (at least, not right now), but in the sense of making your home WiFi, well, truly wireless. The heavily-redacted, public version of a recent filing Google made with the FCC (PDF) seeks permission to test certainly wireless technologies in the 3.5 GHz wireless band, a stretch of the spectrum the FCC has set aside to be the “innovation band” for new and developing tech. A spokesperson for the company told Buisiness Insider that the company is testing the viability of a wireless network in that stretch of the EM band, and said, “The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers.” Specifically, Google will be testing [redacted] while operating [redacted] and investigating [redacted] and [redacted], which is less than useful information for us lay-people. They will, however, be doing the tests in Atlanta, Austin, and Provo — all current Google Fiber cities. Google also plans to deploy some kind of other kind of test technology in Atwater, Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Bruno, San Francisco, and San Jose, CA; Boulder, CO; Kansas City, KS; Omaha, NE; Raleigh, NC; and Reston, VA. Without specifically saying what they’re up to (publicly), Google writes in their filing that “Users of the spectrum might, for instance, deploy “small cell” networks that can carry heavy loads of data in high-traffic areas — such as crowded stadiums — or offer fixed wireless broadband services in rural areas,” and “requests authorization to transmit in a variety of locations and environments that meet several characteristics, including the radio propagation environment, height and variety of clutter (buildings and foliage), existence of suitable Google infrastructure and resources to support experimentation, and existence of partners who may participate in the tests.” If Google’s attempt to reduce the amount of fiber present in Google Fiber sounds familiar, it’s because this is the exact same issue happening in San Jose right now. The planned fiber build-out in greater Silicon Valley is on hold for now while Google investigates ways to use wireless tech instead of running hundreds of miles of (expensive, time-consuming) cable.

Updated August 11, 2016 10:45AM SHARE ALSO SEE Salesforce Customer Relationship Management CRM Cloud Computing Productivity Collaboration Microsoft Google Acquisition Technology News While Salesforce didn't shout from the rooftops about its recent decision to acquire the "living document" platform provider Quip, it clearly sees big potential in integrating Quip's offerings into its own. Quip, a four-year-old San Francisco-based tech firm with just about 40 employees, is on track to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Salesforce, which is paying an estimated $750 million for the company. Since news of the transaction emerged with Salesforce's August 1 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company has said little more about its plans. But Quip's platform promises to bring significant value to sales and marketing activities. Founded in 2012 by Facebook and Google veterans on a mission to "redefine productivity software," Quip offers a cloud-based platform for "helping organization work less dumb," the company said on its Web site. Its software enables business users to create living documents where they can share content, spreadsheet data, links, updates and chats from a single hub. Quip's 'Living Documents' "As part of Salesforce, we will be able to expand our service more quickly and reach millions of people all over the world -- which has been our mission since day one," Quip CEO Bret Taylor and head of engineering Kevin Gibbs wrote in a blog post when the acquisition was announced. By combining forces with Salesforce, "the possibilities of mixing data, content and communication are amazing," they said. Before launching Quip, Taylor was the CTO of Facebook and Gibbs was the tech lead for Google's App Engine. Taylor is also a veteran of Google, where he started the Developer product group. Quip launched the first version of its flagship offering in July 2013. At the time, Taylor and Gibbs described it as a "modern word processor that enables you to create beautiful documents on any device -- phones, tablets and the desktop." The company has since updated the platform with a variety of other features, including support for social interactions and search, chat rooms and, most recently, its living documents design. A living document, "tells you when your colleague updates the sales figures; it buzzes your phone when a task is assigned to you; it’s constantly bubbling with your team’s feedback; it’s always updated with the data you need," Quip staffers Nate Botwick and Edmond Lau wrote in a blog post in February. 'More To Come' After Close In its SEC filing, Salesforce described Quip as "a next-generation productivity platform designed for teams, combining communication and content to enable collaboration within documents or spreadsheets, on phones, tablets, wearables and the desktop." A spokesperson for Salesforce told us today that the company was not sharing any further details about the acquisition at this time, but said that there would be more to come following the closing of the sale, which is expected to happen sometime before the end of October. Salesforce's acquisition of Quip is "not only a shot across the bow at Microsoft (and Google) but has deep implications for the future of the entire colaboration and CRM market," Alex Gorbansky, CEO of the marketing-focused knowledge management firm Docurated wrote in a post on Venture Beat Saturday. The transaction is a sign of how CRM is converging with collaboration and document management, and of how document management is becoming increasingly relevant to sales, he said.

Giovanni Bruno Aug 11, 2016 11:59 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Alphabet's  (GOOGL) venture capital unit, Google Venture's, founder Bill Maris has told the company he will be leaving, CNBC's John Fort reported on Thursday's "Squawk Alley." Maris was responsible for overseeing critical investments such as Nest, Uber and coffeemaker Blue Bottle. Maris' departure is the most recent in a string of exits from the company. Nest CEO Tony Fadell left in June, and chief technology officer and former head of Google's self-driving car initiative Chirs Urmson left the company as well. "I'm not sure this strikes me as a big deal. Not because Bill Maris isn't a good guy, but we've had spades of executives of Google leave before. Marissa Meyer for example and yet the company has continued to do quite well," Fort said. Moreover, Fort believes that in some cases executives, such as Maris, acquire a large sum of wealthy from working with a company such as Alphabet and then say to themselves it may be time to move on to something new.

Even though they are one of the most important tools in everyday life, they can often pose security problems for users. To protect users, Google has released two new security features that attempt to make Gmail a little more foolproof place to be. The new features will rollout within a couple of weeks, Google says. On the Web and on the Android app, users will get see now red question marks instead of profile pictures of senders if they have not been authenticated by either Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or DKIM, the search giant said in its blog post. For the Web only, Google is extending its Safe Browsing feature from Google Search and Chrome to Gmail. When you receive an email with a link to website known to be associated with phishing, malware, or unwanted software, users will now see the below warning. It is important to mention that a sender who has not been authenticated or the link that has been shown as potentially dangerous might or might not pose any threat to the user. These warning signs have been added so that the users can take a moment to consider their safety before they fall prey to the hackers.Earlier this year, Google added a new security feature to Gmail - an upgrade to its Data Loss Prevention service with the inclusion of OCR. The feature reads email attachments with the aim of preventing a leak of confidential documents, and is meant only for Google Apps for Work Unlimited customers. Before that, Google started warning Gmail users about emails from unencrypted sources, flagging those email providers not using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) standard.

The man who founded Google Ventures – now known as GV – in 2009, Bill Maris, has decided to leave the search engine giant for reasons not known as of yet. A report from Recode says that he will be done with his employer by the end of this week and David Krane will reportedly be taking his place to head the Internet giant’s venture arm. A Middlebury student studying neuroscience, Mr. Maris, co-founded a Web hosting firm earlier on prior to his recruitment by Google, where he founded GV. Mr. Krane is currently a managing partner at the company’s venture arm, which he joined in 2010 after spending roughly 10 years as the director of global communications and public affairs at Google. This news comes at an interesting point for Alphabet Inc – the parent company of GV, Google, and many other units – as it adds on top of a series of high profile departures in the company recently. Rich Miner, the co-founder of the Android mobile operating system, recently said farewell to GV to initiate and work on an education related project within the search engine giant. The cofounder of Nest Labs (an Alphabet-owned subsidiary that Google acquired in 2014 for $3.2 billion), Tony Fadell, recently parted ways with Alphabet along with numerous high level employees and executives, including the technology chief Chris Urmson, who recently left Google’s autonomous car division. As the founder of the-then Google Ventures, Mr. Maris had a substantial amount of power at the unit. In February, he said – in an interview on stage – that he currently invests half a billion dollars a year on part of GV into various projects. Despite of the board of investors behind GV, Mr. Maris was ultimately in charge of every decision. With Mr. Krane replacing Mr. Maris, it isn’t yet known whether any changes would be made or that the top-down operations will be effected. However, an unidentified source close to the matter in GV claims that Mr. Krane will not be an acting CEO but a permanent one. Being promoted to managing director at GV nearly two years ago, the new chief executive at the venture arm has had enough experience to run the show as he was positioned at the most senior post under Mr. Maris. Mr. Maris had a child earlier this year and doesn’t seem to have any career plans following his departure. A source says that he has been having several ideas for the future but needs some time off before he can get back to business; but it most likely won’t be at Google. However, his departure is otherwise sudden. Recode suggests that disputes between GV and Google Capital could’ve played a key role behind Mr. Maris’s departure. Furthermore, Google has been pouring investments into companies off its balance sheet directly; GV has some substantial stakes in the Internet giant’s portfolio including the ride-hailing service, Uber. In 2013, GV led the $258 million funding Series C round for Uber at a $4 billion evaluation. The company is now reportedly valued at an estimated $60 billion. Mr. Maris noted in an interview last month that Uber was actually one of Mr. Krane’s investments and he also spearheaded GV’s investments in Blue Bottle Coffee and Nest Labs.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In GV Founder and CEO Bill Maris Resigns (GOOGL) By Shiv Mehta, CFA | August 11, 2016 — 11:32 AM EDT Bill Maris, the founder and CEO of Google's venture-capital arm, GV, has resigned from the company, according to a ReCode report on Thursday. People familiar with the matter said that Maris will be replaced by the current managing director of GV, David Krane, who has been associated with holding company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) for many years. Maris' exit is the third top-level resignation at Alphabet in recent weeks. Google’s Chief Technology Officer and former director of the company’s driverless car project, Chris Urmson, left the company last week amid reports he was unhappy with the direction of the car project. In June, Tony Fadell, CEO of the home-automation entity Nest, tendered his resignation. Who is Bill Maris? A trained neuroscientist, Maris founded Google Ventures in 2009, and built it into a reputable name in Silicon Valley. The company relied on data sciences to make investment decisions and received significant capital from Google. Maris also helped Google in forming Calico, which is Alphabet’s somewhat-mysterious health-and-wellness venture focusing on aging and related diseases. (See also: 5 Mega-Cap Technology Companies That Invest in Venture Capital.) Under Maris, GV managed more than $2.4 billion in assets in 2015. More recently, the firm has cut back on its investments in Europe and seed-stage companies, in response to prevailing market forces, Maris told ReCode on Thursday, “When you have a two-and-a-half-billion-dollar fund, a seed investment has to take time to move the needle," he said. " In terms of Europe, it was an ebb and the flow. I’m super optimistic there. In fact, one of the deals we did there— Kobalt Music Group— is one that I drove.” The venture capital firm rebranded itself as GV after Google reorganized itself to create parent company Alphabet Inc. GV has invested in more than 300 companies including the global ride-hailing app Uber, e-commerce company Jet, and Magic Leaf. According to venture capital research firm CB Insights, GV has been among the most active venture capital firms in the last six months. (See also: Why Alphabet Will Boost Google Stock Prices .) Quality Time Maris, who is well-known in Silicon Valley, did not elaborate on his future plans in his interview with ReCode, but, said, “I have an 11-month-old son and a wife. And I legitimately want to spend more time with them. It’s mission accomplished for me. Eight years is longer than I thought I would spend.” He added, “GV is seen as a premier venture capital operation around the world. If it weren’t in great shape, that would be the wrong time to leave. I’m leaving because everything is great. David (Krane) is a dear friend and completely prepared and the right person to take it on. I want to give him the room to use his imagination.” STOCKS: GOOGL Learn how to invest by subscribing to the Investing Basics newsletter Thanks for signing up to Investing Basics.

It's called "Dragon Spotting," and it uses Google's Cloud Vision technology to analyze your environment and blend the dragon Elliott into the scene as viewed through the phone's camera lens. "Dragon Spotting" is accessible via a mobile website starting today, with the film hitting theaters this Friday. The game uses Cloud Vision's label detection feature to "identify objects in the user’s field of vision, dubbed 'entities,'" according to product manager Ram Ramanathan and Google Zoo director Michael Yapp. (Google Zoo is the company's internal creative team.) From there, the software returns a number of potential entities identified within the shot. The objects can be items around your home, like a piece of furniture, or they can be outdoor entities like trees. Google software analyzes your surroundings and blends in Elliott the dragon "For example, if the user needs to identify 'couch,' the website checks against a list of possible responses: 'chair, futon, couch, sofa,'" the duo wrote. "As soon as the recognized entity matches the desired object, Elliot is revealed." Because iPhone owners can't tap into Google's Cloud Vision in the same way that Android users can, the iOS version of "Dragon Spotting" is less exciting. Instead of working automatically, it asks you to upload pictures of objects to the mobile site to see if Elliot is hiding nearby. Google is able to accomplish this feat by using machine learning to train its image-recognition algorithms, which Cloud Vision taps into before sending the data to the mobile website. This same technology is used to detect the emotions of people in photos, extract text from within photos, identify languages, and automatically moderate images on the web. It's a powerful form of artificial intelligence Google is now using in a variety of ways across its various web services and apps. (Coincidentally, the company's machine learning-focused Google Brain team is doing a Reddit Ask Me Anything later this today.) There couldn't be a more fitting way to promote the new film. Pete's Dragon is a remake of a 1977 classic that was popular at the time for mixing live-action film with animation, with Elliott resembling a cartoon character that exists in the real world. The original Pete's Dragon wasn't the first Disney film to use the technique — the company did it with Mary Poppins a decade prior and with Fantasia back in 1940. Yet the mixing of a virtual character with real world environments is a perfect description of modern-day AR, and the plot of Pete's Dragon specifically revolved around that theme.

By Conner Forrest | August 11, 2016, 7:40 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus The map of proposed locations for testing. Image: Google In telecommunications development, one of the biggest bottlenecks is often the "last mile," or the piece of a network required to deliver service to a consumer or business. In fiber optic deployments, like Google Fiber, that often involves laying additional cables to connect homes or offices to the network. However, a recent FCC filing seems to suggest that Google could be going after an additional strategy to help advance its last mile efforts—wireless broadband. In the filing, Google formally requested authorization to conduct radio experiments using "experimental transmitters" in up to 20 US locations for two years. More about Networking Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates How to deploy a Samba domain controller in under 10 minutes Real-world server room nightmares Subscribe to TechRepublic's Data Center Trends newsletter Specifically, Google wants to develop technology using Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) technologies in the 3.5GHz band. Particularly, testing will happen between the 3.4GHz and 3.8GHz bands, which will "ensure that Google has access to sufficient spectrum for experimentation while avoiding interference to incumbent operations," according to filing. While the additional tools could be helpful for Google Fiber itself, Forrester principal analyst Dan Bieler said it could also be a push to increase pressure on traditional telecommunications providers, which would also benefit Google. "The further mobile data charges fall and the more areas get decent mobile broadband coverage, the better for Google's core business," Bieler said. There will be a certain number of transmitters set up in each given area. So far, the filing has listed the following cities as potential test beds: Atwater, CA; Mountain View, CA; Palo Alto, CA; San Bruno, CA; San Francisco, CA; San Jose, CA; Boulder, CO; Kansas City, KS; Omaha, NE; Raleigh, NC; Provo, UT; and Reston, VA. SEE: Google's Fiber lottery: Predicting who's next and how Google picks winners According to Google's filing, the experiments would "advance radio technologies associated with the new CBRS service and be conducted without harmful interference to other authorized users." Many has noted that Google's latest filing comes on the heels of its acquisition of Webpass, a high-speed residential ISP. Webpass operates a fiber network and rooftop wireless network which could help with these experiments as well as speeding the development of Google Fiber, in general. Adding a wireless option to Google Fiber could help speed deployments of the service in more crowded or densely populated areas, where running individual fiber lines would be costly and complicated. Additionally, use of the 3.5GHz band, which is far less crowded than the traditionally used 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, could potentially alleviate bandwidth issues. However, it could also help Google in another area of innovation. "Fixed wireless is hardly a new technology, but it has lots of potential to reach people in low density areas," Bieler said. "Google maintains that it is looking at fixed wireless for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS). This could be interpreted as Google testing the waters for IoT connectivity in the context of its Brillo activities." Of course, Google isn't the first to try to develop a faster wireless alternative. Companies like Starry have built alternative wireless technologies leveraging different radio bands, or options like millimeter wave band active phased array technology to improve connectivity. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers A recent FCC filing suggests Google will test wireless broadband technologies in 24 US cities over the next two years, potentially advancing its efforts with Fiber. Wireless broadband could help with "last mile" development, making it easier to take advantage of existing fiber networks and get broadband into homes and businesses. A plethora of advances in wireless technology are being made by a host of vendors, include Google and Starry, paving the way for broader connectivity options in the future.

Home White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Calendar About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here Channels Featured Products White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Channels Customer Experience Digital Experience DAM Digital Workplace SharePoint & Office 365 Web CMS Mobile Document Mgt Google Follows Microsoft's Lead, Upgrades Email Inboxes By David Roe | Aug 11, 2016 CHANNEL: Document Management Is Google responding to Microsoft's latest email upgrades? Hard to say, but just two weeks after Microsoft upgraded its Outlook Inbox, Google announced an effort to declutter Gmail and help users rank importance of messages.  And Thijs van As, Zurich-based product manager at Google, claims there's reason for excitement. The changes enable the Inbox to interact with a project management application (Trello) and a software collaboration platform (GitHub), which will both enable users to improve their flow of email notifications. Those two additions alone add enterprise appeal as it puts Inbox at the heart of work processes and enables users to work directly out of their enterprise inbox. “You'll discover more integrations that make it easier to see what's happening and then act with organized Trello and GitHub project updates and Google Alerts previews. You'll also see updates based on your feedback, including Google Drive integration," he explained in a blog post.  Google is also introducing upgrades based on user feedback that will improve collaboration and processes. They include: The ability to insert Google Drive links directly into email and control who can access the content behind those links The ability to drag-and-drop contacts between to, cc and bcc in compose on web The ability to delete directly from the inbox Van As promises the Gmail team "will continue to improve the email experience so you can spend less time dealing with email and more time being productive.” This is all good for users and also reaffirms that reports of the death of email are greatly exaggerated. Akumina’s New Outlook Content Add-In Akumina still believes the inbox has an important role in enterprise work processes. Just this week, it announced the release of Content Approval Add-in for Outlook, which informs Outlook users by email when new tasks have been assigned to them from SharePoint. SharePoint, as we saw earlier in the week, is still used by a large number of enterprises, particularly for content management. So an inbox notification informing users about new assignments should prove useful. The new Add-In is specifically for users of Akumina’s InterChange technology,  a fully-extendable digital workplace platform built for Microsoft Office365 and Microsoft Azure. InterChange AppManager also includes purposeful apps that enable employees to quickly access the data and tools they need to get their jobs done. Box Expands Global Footprint Enterprise collaboration heavyweight Box has also been busy. Co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie announced this week that Box is expanding its Box Zones offering to Australia and Canada. Box Zones, launched in April, enables businesses globally to adopt Box as a content management platform while letting them store their data in the geographic region of their choice. Initially it offered customers the option of data centers in Germany, Ireland, Singapore and Japan, in partnership with IBM and Amazon.  This week it has expanded to two more major geographies — a reflection of the fact that at least half of its 62,000 client companies are engaged in business activity outside of the US. Box is also rolling out improvements to Box Accelerator, which will give businesses upload speed up to six times faster than current rates. “Box is now an average of five times faster in Japan, four times faster in Australia, and three times faster in the UK,” Levie wrote. Levie also indicated that Box would continue to develop its support for global compliance standards, which means getting in step with banks, healthcare providers, life sciences companies, law firms and governments. DocStar Improves Processes Finally this week, docStar introduced eclipse Forms, which it describes as the next step in its product evolution. Designed with drag and drop technology, eclipse Forms enables users to easily design any form, any time. By integrating with its line of business applications, it also enables users to auto-populate forms with data and receive email notifications, "ensuring efficient, accurate forms processing across the entire organization." Data entry is standardized through automatic formatting, calculations and validation with third party applications. Electronic submission of completed forms eliminates rekeying information and associated data entry errors. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Dropbox Is Reinventing Itself to Win More Love From IT 7 Big Problems with the Internet of Things Simplicity is the Future of Customer Engagement Standardized Processes: Great in Theory, Not in Practice Turn Off Your Printer: It's Almost World Paper Free Day Google Adds Slack Integration to G Suite, More News Dropbox Paper Enhances Collaboration, More Document News Adobe Updates Acrobat DC to Improve Document Editing, Signing Google Drive Search Gets a Natural Language Boost, More News Useful Article?

 Former EMC exec: Google's cloud efforts against Amazon are like 'a Microsoft phone' — too little too late Julie Bort Aug. 11, 2016, 11:37 AM 7,236 facebook linkedin twitter email print Justin Sullivan/Getty Images While much of the industry is bullish on Google's chances to snatch a big chunk of the growing cloud computing market away from Amazon, especially under cloud boss Diane Greene, one long-time tech exec doesn't think so: the guy that helped EMC buy Greene's first company, VMware. Mark Lewis was once EMC's CTO and chief strategy officer responsible for acquisitions. He led EMC's 2007 purchase of VMware. He left that role in 2012 to found a storage software startup, Formation Data Systems. He's also an advisor at private equity investment firm Silver Lake. He tells Business Insider that Amazon owns the cloud computing market so thoroughly, and is so far ahead in market share and features, that it's "game over" for other contenders, much the same way that Google owns the internet search ad market today. For example, a survey done by Pacific Crest last fall of about 300 IT managers showed 60% of them using cloud services, primarily Amazon, but also Salesforce, Microsoft Azure. And most of them predicted they would stay with Amazon three years from now. Market research also shows Amazon finished 2015 with 31% of the cloud infrastructure market, compared to Microsoft Azure's 9% and Google's 4%. And Amazon Web Services is still growing rapidly. AWS reported 31% year-over-year revenue growth last quarter. Game over? "Amazon won this round. It's game over," Lewis tells us. Formation Data Systems founder CEO Mark Lewis Formation Data Systems He says the time to have beaten Amazon was years ago, when the industry was still in denial as to how successful AWS could become. These days Amazon's cloud boss Werner Vogels likes to tout, "If you look at other cloud providers in the market, there's quite a few of them still sort of in the phase where AWS was five, six years ago — in 2010 — at the moment we were still much more focused on the infrastructure side of things than the sort of rich collection of services." Lewis agrees with Vogels. "Amazon can release new code into its stack in 11 seconds," Lewis says, describing how fast Amazon can roll out a new feature, or tweak performance. "Google is entering the market a decade late with me-too features. It's like Microsoft going after the phone market. They didn't have a chance and I don't think it will work for Google either," he says. Or early days? Google's Diane Greene would counter this by saying that its early days for cloud computing with many enterprises planning on increasing their spending on cloud, and a lot of them wanting to use multiple vendors. Google believes its cloud business could be bigger than its ad business by 2020. Google currently makes the majority of its $75 billion in annual revenue from ads. Google cloud boss Diane Greene Fortune Brainstorm Tech While Greene would not share the cloud unit’s growth numbers, during a recent interview with Business Insider, she told us that “growth is really good and we’re doing great stuff with some really big customers." Lewis does think that eventually, some company will come along and challenge Amazon, but it will be with completely new technology, new innovation, Lewis says.  That's what's happening to his industry, computer storage. An ecommerce site that started as a bookseller, Amazon, came out of the blue to offer cloud computing and today the storage industry is shrinking as more companies choose to rent storage on the cloud, largely from Amazon, instead of buying it from traditional vendors. "Someone is going to take down Amazon but it will be some new company I don't know the name of yet, nor do you. But it won't be one of the old guys, anymore than Myspace will kill Facebook," Lewis tells us. Google could not be immediately reached for comment.

After the ‘Explore Interests‘ card and autocomplete improvements, plus laying the groundwork for Assistant, the next new thing is a bottom row of tabs, with ‘Home’ and ‘Dashboard’ occupying it. While the Home tab is the expected Google Now homepage, Dashboard is new and therefore interesting. From the tips we’ve had on this it’s pretty clear it’s not really working properly yet, but what we can gather is this: it seems to only work with the Nexus Launcher, at least at the moment, and collects data from across the different Google services and pools them all in the tab.

Google has been fined a sum of $6.75 million for competition violations by Russia's antimonopoly watchdog on Thursday. The antimonopoly body accused U.S. technology company Google of forcing retailers to install and keep a suite of its app on mobile phones that were sold on the Russian market. SeekingAlpha adds: Google was found last October to have violated rules related to the objection. The fine amount was determined as a portion of Google Play sales in the country, though an exact breakdown has not been disclosed. An appeal of the case is set to continue August 16 and talks to settle the matter amicably are additionally said to be under consideration. Google has also run into antitrust issues with the European Commission in recent months. android business google ← You may like to read: → Hack of Democrats' Accounts Was Wider Than Believed, Officials Say Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

If Google fights the fine in court, they admit the Russian court has jurisdiction. It's a camel's nose in the jurisdictional tent, since they could just waltz into court, and say "The only reason they have the apps installed is because they want to use the 'Android' trademark; fine: call it 'Robotizirovannyy' or whatever the hell else you want to call it other than the trademark, and you're good to go". This is about Russia's recent laws on cryptographic communications being required to be able to be eavesdropped upon by the FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation) and SVR (Foreign Intelligence Service), and about device data being decryptable. The apps are relevant because the browser includes HTTPS, and GMail, YouTube, and other apps use strong encryption. They are basically trying to force the strong cryptography "gone", or (minimally) force it "off by default", or (preferably) backdoor the hell out of it.

Well, that officially went through on on August 8, 2016. If you are using the old spreadsheet format, Google will throw up errors and not be abel to update your business hours. Google added one column for each day of the week's regular hours and have new rules for formatting hours. You can see the new format for the spreadsheet over here and download it from there was well. Google said in November, "to gain better control over locations’ hours and avoid eventual formatting errors in Google My Business Locations, you should transition to the new spreadsheet format as soon as it’s convenient for you. In the future, the old format will stop being supported." Now, you have no choice but to adopt the new format. Forum discussion at Google+.

So Google, a week or so ago, announced quietly in an ongoing Google Web Search Help thread that you can now opt out of these trending searches. To do so, you must be on the Google Search App versions 6.1+. Then go to Google Now, click on the menu (three-bar icon) and select Settings. From settings choose Autocomplete and then toggle off the "Show trending searches." Here is what trending looks like in the search box: Forum discussion at Google Web Search Help.

Search Engine Roundtable     Home Browse by Categories Browse By Dates Search » Turn Off Mobile Site [X] Close Home > Google News > Google SEO > Bug: Google Search Console Links to Your Site Shows No Data Available Bug: Google Search Console Links to Your Site Shows No Data Available Aug 11, 2016 • 7:28 am | (38) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next Story There seems to be a bug with the Google Search Console's Links To Your Site report where many are saying it shows "no data available." In fact, I am able to replicate it on many Google Search Console profiles I have in my account. Although for this site, it seems to show data but the data is way below the typical links I have pointing to this site. Here is a screen shot showing no data available for one of the more popular sites I have access to in my Google Search Console account: As you can see, nothing is shown. There are dozens and dozens of threads on this at Google Webmaster Help, I just linked to one. Steve D. a top contributor in the forums said: it is a reporting glitch. Both the internal link report and the links to your site report are affected. Google is aware of the error. Again, it is a reporting glitch, there are no negative impacts to the website. Although, I have yet to hear official word from Google on the issue. I do still believe this is one of the many reporting glitches we have with Google Search Console over the years. Forum discussion at Google Webmaster Help. Update: John Mueller of Google confirmed they are looking into it: @rustybrick we're looking at it, thanks!— John Mueller (@JohnMu) August 11, 2016 Update 2: The links seems to have returned by August 15th for most. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Daily Search Forum Recap: August 10, 2016   Comments: Arpin Gajjar 08/11/2016 11:47 am There are also problem with google index data. sitemap submitted index and google index data is different. and Not even update after 8-10 days. Please confirm Chucktown 08/11/2016 01:04 pm Jeez, nobody has said this is a sign of Penguin coming? I'm disappointed. Anyway, this is a sign of Penguin coming. steve 08/11/2016 03:50 pm I see hacked displaying in serps looking at cache they will say last date being june or july. such as Google's cache of http://www.worcesterclassic.co.uk/?page_id=280. It is a snapshot of the page as it appeared on 13 Jul 2016 11:24:18 GMT or This is Google's cache of http://www.eye2eye.com.sg/component/content/article/343. It is a snapshot of the page as it appeared on 5 Jun 2016 22:44:02 GMT yesterday most these hacked were gone, today back again. Maybe they are working on some sort of update and keep rolling back to an old index mad.dda 08/11/2016 05:51 pm I think google was testing penguin last 3 weeks and was using their computing power to that test. Over 3 weeks there were not updates of index status in search console. Also googlebot was very lazy past three weeks. From Monday googlebot is crawling normally, but still there is no update of index status in search console, and now there is problem with "links to your site" and "internal links". But I think penguin didn't pass that test. Gary Barker 08/11/2016 08:14 pm Got this problem on my site about an hour ago and still showing no data available Gor 08/11/2016 09:45 pm Anyone else notice big serp changes at this moment?

Steve Bain 08/12/2016 07:57 pm I like a bit of Google bashing as much as the next man, but when I look at my search results I've got to wonder what I've done to upset Bing/Yahoo - I can't seem to get any traction with them at all. Over 95% of my organic traffic comes from GG (small site, 206 pages with about 20,000 search visitors per month) is this normal?

It clearly hit Google's radar, mostly because Matt Cutts took notice, and John Mueller from Google apologized about the issue and said the team at Google is investigating. John wrote, "We've been taking a look at this on our side, to see what all happened there. Sorry about the confusion there!" @gaberivera We've been taking a look at this on our side, to see what all happened there. Sorry about the confusion there!— John Mueller (@JohnMu) August 11, 2016 This is after Gabe Rivera from Techmeme complained about Google even labeling their internal links as having issues: There are even more absurd details to this saga. Google is throwing up warnings for internal page URLs that we use… https://t.co/ucVWTpsTiG— Gabe Rivera (@gaberivera) August 10, 2016 Good to know people, eh? Either way, I assume the way Techmeme is set up is a bit of a challenge for Google to handle. So they need to fix something on their end or make a whitelist of some sorts for them.

By Oliver Cragg August 11, 2016 16:28 BST HTC's rumoured Google Nexus Sailfish smartphone has been spotted on AnTuTu and Geekbench tests readouts.Getty Images The evidence is piling up by the day that HTC and Google are preparing to launch a new pair of Nexus-branded handsets by the end of 2016. Yet, while most of the attention has been directed at Marlin – the larger of the two smartphones – a pair of benchmark test readouts have now reaffirmed earlier reports relating to the slightly smaller device called Sailfish. With HTC reportedly on manufacturing duty for the Google Nexus-branded smartphones, leaks have been coming quick and fast, with recent reports claiming the duo are set to launch on 4 October. A source "close" to HTC's Nexus project expanded on Sailfish in late June, sparking claims that the 5in smartphone will replace the similarly sized LG Nexus 5X in Google's 2016 line-up. The specs listed in that report have been further substantiated by an AnTuTu benchmark result leaked by reliable smartphone tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer, a.k.a OnLeaks. The specification list – spotted by Hemmerstoffer on Chinese microblogging site Weibo – reaffirms that the Sailfish will run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, with Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 820 chipset and the Adreno 530 GPU under the hood. The 13 megapixel rear camera and 8 megapixel front camera, 4GB of RAM, 32GB internal storage and 1080p Full HD display listings also tally with previous reports, with only the 2770mAh battery, 5in screen size and USB-C support "unconfirmed" by the readout. With a Geekbench listing also backing up the AnTuTu readings, the Sailfish picture has become fairly clear and is now lacking only a retail-friendly name to go and a finalised design to go with its leaked specs. A recent render mock-up based on the leaks provided potential Nexus buyers with a peek at how both the Marlin and Sailfish smartphones could look. Speculation for the larger Marlin handset points toward a relatively similar specification list to the Sailfish – with the exception of its larger 5.5in QHD AMOLED display and a 3450mAh battery.

By Alison DeNisco | August 11, 2016, 7:18 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Google's new security warnings will display if an email sender is authenticated. Image: Google Google continues to make its Google Apps suite more business-friendly, with new security warnings added to Gmail to keep emails safer from phishing and other threats. More for CXOs Innovate like Amazon: Put values and tactics ahead of strategy How women in tech are making progress in Australia, and what the rest of the world can learn The top 6 reasons why employees leave, and how you can stop them Subscribe to TechRepublic's Executive Briefing newsletter The warnings, announced Wednesday, will impact Gmail use on the web or Android. If an email sender cannot be authenticated, Gmail will display a question mark in place of the sender's profile photo, corporate logo, or avatar. Users are authenticated with either Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records, or DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), a digital signature on outgoing messages that uses a private domain key to encrypt your domain's outgoing mail headers. If you receive a message with a link to a site known for phishing, malware, or Unwanted Software, you'll see a warning when you click on the link—an extension of the Safe Browsing protection already available on most browsers. The page that pops up will say: "Warning—visiting this web site may harm your computer!" The user will then be presented with the option to continue to the site, or learn more about the problems found as well as more information about keeping your computer safe. SEE: 5 tips for managing multiple Google accounts The security update should help combat email-spoofing that is frequently used in phishing attacks, and the scam known as business email compromise that has cost companies more than $3.1 billion since October 2013, according to the FBI. Gmail users were previously able to check whether an email was authenticated by opening the message and clicking the down arrow next to the sender's name. If it was authenticated, the message would display a "signed-by" header with the sending domain, and a "mailed-by" header with the domain name. The new update makes this information easier for users to see. "Malware and phishing continue to be the bane of email users," said Gartner analyst Mark Hung. "Although Google's new security warnings don't break any new ground from a technology perspective, they serve to help unsuspecting users from malicious attacks." Welcoming the enterprise The new warnings mark yet another effort by Google to aid all users, including businesses—a wise move as Google Apps gain more customers in the enterprise. Email security is a concern for many consumers, but is a crucial issue for corporations. If Google wants to hold onto its business users, and increase its audience, it must keep making safety improvements such as these. In 2014, Google announced a Chrome extension called End-to-End, which provides an easier way for two independent providers to maintain end-to-end encryption of emails. That year it also launched Inbox, a multi-platform app that threads emails into chronological chunks and categorizes them. Additionally, Google recently promoted Google+ from an "additional Google service" to a "core service" for Google Apps for Work customers, joining the other core services of Calendar, Contacts, Drive, Gmail, Google Talk/Hangouts, Groups for Business, and Sites. The company calls Google+ "a social network designed for business," and highlights how it makes it easier to communicate with other employees and customers. On Tuesday, Google integrated Trello and GitHub project updates into Inbox as well. That day, the company was also awarded a patent for a video conferencing drone, which could dramatically change the conference call experience if pursued. The company is also currently working to bring HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to google.com to strengthen its data encryption and protect against eavesdroppers, man-in-the-middle attacks, and hijackers who attempt to spoof a trusted website. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers On Wednesday, Google announced new security warnings for Gmail to keep emails safer from phishing and threats. If an email sender cannot be authenticated, Gmail will display a question mark in place of the sender's profile photo, corporate logo, or avatar. This information was previously available with a few clicks, but now it will be more obvious for the end user. The update is the latest Google initiative to make the platform better for enterprise users, along with email encryption efforts and the elevation of Google+ to a core service for Google Apps for Work customers, among other programs.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Plankton malware drifts into Android Market 14 Jun 2011 6 Android, Google, Malware, Mobile, Privacy, SophosLabs Post navigation Previous: IT administrators await mammoth Microsoft security patch bundle Next: Rapper Soulja Boy blames Facebook hackers for racist, homophobic rant by Vanja Svajcer 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit The rate at which we discover new malware samples for the Android platform is increasing. At the beginning of the year we got a few samples every month and today it is not uncommon to get a few every week. While most of the newly discovered samples are released outside of the official Android Market, some aren’t, and it is unfortunate that users cannot rely on Google to prevent malicious users from submitting malicious applications to the Android Market. Because apps are self-signed, there is no good way to verify that an application is coming from a trusted source. Theft of intellectual property is common, as rogue developers are repackaging versions of legitimate applications and selling them under their own names. Rants aside, the latest potential attack on the market comes in the form of Plankton malware. Plankton has been included in at least ten applications on the Android Market that have now been removed by Google. The malware was initially discovered by Xuxian Jiang, Assistant Professor at North Carolina State University. The applications that included the Plankton framework were published on the market for more than two months before anybody noticed anything unusual about them. Some of the applications became very popular and were downloaded over 100,000 times. I had a look at the functionality of Plankton and the available samples. The majority of existing Android malware is very obvious in its intention to provide some kind of benefit, usually financial, to the attacker. The best examples of this are the SMS Trojans that send SMS messages to premium rate service numbers. As soon as I started analysing the Plankton code I realized why the malware, if we can call it malware, has gone undiscovered on the Android Market for such a long time. Plankton is one of those borderline pieces of code whose malicious intent is not immediately obvious. The code suggests that it is a platform, but it does not disclose its purpose. Descriptions of the apps pulled from the Android Market contain the text This application is brought to you free sponsored by Choopcheec Platform. It adds a search shortcut on the home screen or application screen. Indeed, when I installed one of the affected apps, an additional shortcut appeared on the home screen. Initially, I assumed that the original intention of Choopcheec Platform was to serve adverts and make money from search referrals. It suggests users read the End User License Agreement, an old trick of PUAs (Potentially Unwanted Applications), and this paragraph hints at the real purpose of the Choopcheec Platform: If at our request you send content (e.g., postings, contest submissions, polling questions) or you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), such Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of Angry Bird Cheater. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Angry Bird Cheater, and Angry Bird Cheater shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions.

The behaviour exhibited by the apps that include the platform is outright suspicious. When an app that contains Plankton is installed, a service is launched in the background. The service checks the details of the installed application, including its security permissions, and sends the details to an HTTP server specified in the code. The server replies with a URL that is used to download an additional JAR file with custom code that is loaded by the downloader. At the time of writing, the server, hosted in the Amazon cloud, was online and serving requests. Once the JAR file is downloaded, Plankton uses the DexClassLoader object to load the Dex byte code from the downloaded file. This technique for loading additional code from non-Market websites was demonstrated by Jon Oberheide about a year ago. It provides a potential attacker with a method of circumventing checks of application functionality by Google or by another Android Market provider. If this is not enough to make you think that Plankton reeks of malware, let’s take a look at the downloaded file and its functionality. The downloaded Dex code launches another connection to the Command server and listens for commands to execute. The available commands are: These commands remind me of commands used by the early generation IRC spambots. Overall, although malicious intent is not immediately apparent, the mechanism of downloading additional code, the command-and-control system, and leakage of confidential information to the Plankton server were sufficient characteristics for us to add detection of Plankton framework as Andr/Plankton-A. The concern with Plankton’s approach of loading additional code is that even security software on Android will not get an opportunity to inspect the downloaded file in the usual “on-access” fashion, but only through scheduled and “on-demand” scans. The pressure on Google is building on two fronts. On one side, users are demanding better security and on the other side security vendors like Sophos are putting pressure on Google to provide better operating system interfaces so that security software can be more effective against the ever-increasing tide of Android malware.

What applications are the bad ones? Not enough to just tell us they're out there and that Google is doing something. Remember news stories are supposed to tell us who, WHAT, why, where and how. Reply vanjasvajcer says: June 15, 2011 at 11:54 am Sorry, we have not managed to acquire all affected applications so I could not verify the full list. The applications that contain the Chopcheec platform are allegedly: Gun Bros Cheat Unlock All Purchases Shake To Fake call Favorite Games Backup Angry Birds Rio Unlocker Angry Birds Multiuser Angry Birds Cheater Trainer helper Time limit kids users bring me back my Droid Chit Chat Robo Chat Bathroom Time Chat All the above applications have been developed and published by Crazyapps. In addition to the Crazyapps applications there were Android Snake (by Chopcheec) Guess logo (by Planktond) All the offending apps are taken off-line by Google. Reply wb1 says: June 15, 2011 at 1:21 am The question in my mind is would Google do the AppStore thing and clamp down, or would that tick off too many people who think open is the answer to everything? I have both Android and iOS and I have no issue using the AppStore, but I know this is a huge stumbling block to not only Google as a company (because they would have to admit they were wrong), but many individuals I know. Reply pastriesdan says: March 21, 2012 at 3:19 pm Also an ICS Launcher by Syndicate Apps is infected. Any ideas on how to remove this? Reply DianeC says: July 19, 2012 at 9:24 am I just downloaded application called Brightest Flashlight Free and it came up having Android.ads.plankton.b and said it was a threat. So I tried it on my tablet and the same thing. I reported it to Google market.

SUBSCRIBE Xperiel announces cloud-based platform so marketers can build apps for the Internet of Things The startup, led by engineers who created the tech behind Google Wallet, offers an app builder that it says is easy enough for a child to use. Barry Levine on August 11, 2016 at 11:00 am More Xperiel’s visualization of its platform The huge and growing archipelago of devices, screens and sensors represents an enormous opportunity for whichever companies best connect the pieces. Today, startup Xperiel is announcing its bid to be that connector — a new platform for marketers to quickly and easily build apps that link to GPS, audio signals, digital billboards, connected kiosks and other pieces of the growing Internet of Things. The platform is the first product from the Sunnyvale, California-based company, launched in 2013 by engineers who helped develop the technology that became Google Wallet. Xperiel is currently in a private beta with a few brands, notably the Los Angeles Dodgers, and a self-serve version is planned for release by year’s end. Along with the platform, the company is also announcing today its initial funding of $7 million from investors that include the Los Angeles Dodgers, Major League Baseball, Sun Microsystems’ co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, Intuit’s Scott Cook, Stanford President John Hennessy, Yankees owner Gary Green, Google Board member Diane Greene, Google Senior Vice President Shona Brown and Uber founder Garrett Camp. Xperiel says its platform is “an orchestration layer for the Real World Web,” the area where digital and physical realities meet to create experiential marketing. CEO and co-founder Alex Hertel pointed to the Uber and Starbucks apps, and to the Pokemon Go phenomenon, as pioneering implementations of digital plus physical. Xperiel, he told me, can be used to easily create such experiential marketing at scale. The platform contains three main components. First, there’s a graphically based, patented cloud-based language that enables the creation of mobile applications in less than a hour, without any software development. Here’s an authoring screen for the Xperiel programming language: The second component: the apps themselves, which live in the cloud and download their device-related elements when needed. Here’s a screen from an Xperiel-created app for the Dodgers: Hertel said the app downloads can sometimes be as lightweight as a few kilobytes, they act as native apps, and a marketer can create one app to work on both iOS and Android devices. While there might be a slight performance hit on initial download, he said, there is none on subsequent runs, and the app is kept updated via its cloud link. The third component: a “universal trigger fabric” that automatically connects sensors and signals to the cloud-based apps and thence to their device-based selves. This means that an individual app doesn’t need to create connections to all those inputs or outputs but can simply link to Xperiel in the cloud. Triggers can include GPS locations, audio or visual recognition, beacons, near field communication (NFC) or other signals, and output connections can include stadium video displays, digital billboards or screens on other devices. The current Xperiel test at the Dodgers’ stadium is “turning our park and everything in it into a giant physical-digital ecosystem,” Dodgers CFO Tucker Kain said in a statement, “where every inch of real estate can become digitally interactive… ” One typical use case, Hertel said, is a digital treasure hunt whose pieces are found in different physical places at the stadium. In such a location-based game, an attendee can get a digital puzzle piece by scanning a virtual loyalty card at the concession stand, scoop up other puzzle pieces at specific GPS points à la Pokemon Go, and, when the puzzle is assembled, have her name shown on a stadium video display. This kind of digital treasure hunt for iOS and Android devices, he said, might otherwise take three to four software engineers, three to four months and a budget of about $100,000. But Hertel contended that a marketer with no coding experience can employ the Xperiel platform and build such an app in about 15 minutes. The graphical language is flowchart-based, where the author draws the app’s logic. Hertel said it can program anything that can be developed in Java, adding that “a five- or six-year-old can learn this.” “If you have an infinite budget,” he noted, “we’re not helping you.” The “consumer-facing portion” of IoT Looking to the future, Hertel suggested the Xperiel platform could eventually connect directly into iOS or Android operating systems and that the apps could reside in cars, appliances and other connected devices, in addition to smartphones or tablets. While a subscription is planned for the use of the Xperiel platform, the company’s primary monetization will be a share of the revenue it generates, such as through loyalty cards or additional sales. Xperiel, of course, is not the only company recognizing that a world of countless connected devices, vehicles, displays and appliances, many with their own sensors, offers a huge opportunity. Cisco, for instance, has been building its IoT platform, as have other startups like Evrythng (which is spelled like that). And IFTTT (If This Then That) has built a business around consumers’ ability to create simple “recipes” that link one device’s function to another. But, Hertel said, while others are building different pieces, there is no single platform that allows marketers to easily build and run fully functional apps for users, as Xperiel does. “We’re building the consumer-facing portion of the Internet of Things,” he said.

By Liam Tung | August 11, 2016 -- 10:52 GMT (03:52 PDT) | Topic: Networking Blue dots indicate where Google wants to test 3.5GHz wireless tech. Image: Google Google is urgently preparing a new round of secretive tests of wireless broadband delivery in the US, where it's angling to sidestep incumbent telecom operators. In a new filing with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Google has sought a special license to test wireless broadband technologies in the 3.5GHz band across 24 US locations for two years. Special Feature Next Generation Networks The rising tides of big data, video, and cloud computing are driving tremendous demand for faster and more efficient networks. We delve into how things like software-defined networks (SDN) and new wireless technologies are enabling business transformation. Read More Google said the experiments would support the development of technologies for the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which operates in that band and will be used as a test bed for spectrum sharing. Execs from Google Access, the unit responsible for Google Fiber, have been exploring fixed wireless broadband for low-density areas where costs prohibit laying fiber. Google has requested the authorization be "granted expeditiously" for tests between 3.4GHz and 3.8GHz, the space that has been made available for small-cell spectrum sharing by CBRS devices. It notes that existing licenses for ongoing tests in this band at several locations are set to expire in December. The 24 locations in the new application are spread across cities in California, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia. Google plans to test base stations as well as end-user devices with approved staff and contractors. Google also intends to use the test to improve its Spectrum Access System (SAS) database, which may eventually be used to manage spectrum sharing in the 3.5GHz band. Google had previously developed the SAS database for TV white-space spectrum sharing. News of the application followed a report from the San Jose Mercury News that Google's Fiber rollout has been delayed in some cities, including San Jose where a plan to lay fiber was abruptly brought to halt last month. With its recent acquisition of the small ISP Webpass, Google does have another option now to roll-out high-speed broadband without necessarily digging up streetscapes to lay fiber cable. The Webpass technology is suited to high-density areas with an abundance of apartment blocks, whereas small cell networks in the 3.5GHz range could also be used to provide fixed wireless broadband in rural areas.

According to an FCC filing published last week, the Web giant plans to test wireless broadband tech in 24 US locations, as was first reported by Business Insider. As the report notes, Google has been moving away from traditional fiber pipes in favor of new wireless-transmission technology on the 3.5-GHz band, which it's currently testing in Kansas City. Now, the company has even grander plans: The FCC filing indicates that Google wants to test "experimental transmitters" in California, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia for two years. "We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum," a Google spokesman told Business Insider. "The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to customers." Google did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment; the Federal Communications Commission declined to comment. If approved, this program would mark another step toward a cheaper wireless future—one that got a lot closer since Google Fiber acquired gigabit provider Webpass in June. The San Francisco-based ISP uses point-to-point wireless Ethernet as well as fiber to connect business and residential customers to speeds up to 1Gbps. //Related Articles Google Introduces 3 New Fiber Data Plans for Small Businesses Google Fiber launched in July 2012 offering 1 gigabit Internet access and TV service in select cities across the country. In the years since, it has expanded access to more areas. But while folks in Atlanta, Austin, Kansas City (Missouri and Kansas), Nashville, and Provo are already surfing the super-fast Web, users in San Jose will have to wait. The Mercury News this week reported that Google has halted plans to provide fiber Internet to San Jose, while it explores other (i.e. cheaper) options. Other California towns affected include Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Google's own hometown of Mountain View, the News said.

Photo: A man walks past a building on the Google campus in Mountain View, Calif. Source: AP Russian Federal Antimonopoly Agency (FAS) determined a fine in the amount of $6.7 million as a penalty for the U.S. Google Corporation, the regulator said on Aug. 11. "The fine for breach of antimonopoly laws amounted to 438 mln rubles ($6.7 millions) for Google. We hope the company will perform our decision and pay the fine shortly," Deputy Head of FAS Alexei Dotsenko said. Consultations on a settlement agreement with Google continue despite the announcement, said FAS press service. In March 2016, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) initiated administrative proceedings against Google to determine the amount of the fine under part 2 article 14.31 of the Russian Code of Administrative Offences. Russian State Duma passes bill on 'Google tax' According to the law, Google, being the owner of the Android OS, must pay a fine ranging from 1 percent to 15 percent of its revenues on the Russian market in 2014 for abuse of dominant position on the market of operating systems for mobile devices in Russia.   In January 2016, Head of FAS Igor Artemyev said Russia’s competition law violation penalty for U.S. Google Corporation will most likely amount to 7 percent of the turnover in 2014. According to Artemyev, the fine will most likely be 7 percent of the annual turnover, subject to various factors and aggravating circumstances, such as process protraction. On September 14, 2015, the Federal Antimonopoly Service ruled that Google Inc. and Google Ireland Ltd. had breached the competition protection law under the complaint of the Russian Internet company Yandex. According to the regulator, Google obliged manufacturers of Android OS-based devices to pre-install its applications together with Android platform. FAS said that Google’s policy restricted installation of applications by other developers. Google did not agree with FAS decision and appealed to the court. On February 5, 2015, the Court brought Yandex as a third party in the case and decided to hold hearings behind closed doors. On March 14, the Moscow Arbitration Court has dismissed the lawsuit Google filed against Russia’s FAS.

The fine was determined as a share of Google Play’s domestic sales, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said on August 11. The U.S. tech giant said it would study the decision before determining further action. Following a complaint by Russian search engine Yandex, FAS found in September that Google violated Russian laws by requiring mobile-device makers to install its services as a precondition to getting Google Play on gadgets powered by its Android operating system. The world’s leading phone software supplier also didn’t allow third-party services, such as Yandex’s search, to be preinstalled, the regulator said.

After announcing a $50 million round of funding supported by Goldman, Sachs & Co. in October, the Ann Arbor-based company said it was acquiring a South African competitor a month later. The company's latest move is a literal one, as employees packed up their stuff and moved into the space formerly occupied by Google in the McKinley Towne Centre building at 401 E. Liberty in downtown Ann Arbor. Google is building its own new campus on the city's north side. LLamasoft officially moved in at the end of June and, while the company and the employees are still getting settled in, CEO Don Hicks says the move was a no brainer. "We were damn lucky to get the opportunity to get here, plus, because of the financing moves we made last year, we were able to make the commitment," Hicks said. "Those came together right at the same time, so I feel we were lucky." LLamasoft took over the second and third floors of the building, covering 60,000 square feet of space. Some renovations are complete in the space, while a portion of the office is still being worked on. "The experience has been fantastic. The move was challenging because we did it right in the middle of our summer conference," Hicks said. "For us, this is a huge statement that we're going to continue to grow and we wanted to make this the absolute best destination." LLamasoft moved from its previous offices at the First National Bank Building on Main Street in Ann Arbor, where it occupied 24,000 square feet. Hicks said the company employs nearly 400 people globally with more than 150 people working in the Ann Arbor offices. Having a new facility that is top of the line in terms of location, amenities and atmosphere puts LLamasoft at another level when it comes to talent recruitment, Hicks said. "Now we compete with other software companies throughout the Midwest for talent," Hicks said. In the new space, the company has several new offices and conference rooms available for staff to work in, while also using an open office concept in other portions of the building. There are three kitchens spread out over the two floors with sandwiches and salads provided by Babo Market. "I'm very happy with the feel of the place. The employees seem to really love it," Hicks said. Hicks said a bar is being built in the employee break room that will accompany the ping-pong table, pool table and pinball machine. There are significant portions of the two floors that are not being used by the company right now, so Hicks says he plans on sub-leasing the space to smaller startups in the area. "We're looking for partners who want to come in," Hicks said. "A lot of tech companies, what they can't get is office space in a really nice location for two to three years." Two tenants are already working out of the extra space, both of which are part of investments that Hicks is involved with. Those companies have access to the same team of people at LLamasoft when the startups have questions about challenges they're facing. Locking in for a 10-year lease on the space wasn't a difficult decision to make Hicks said because the company is strong financially following the Goldman, Sachs & Co. investment last year and the revenue streams in place for the coming years. Because its software is offered via subscription service, customers agree to use to the service for a certain number of years when they acquire rights to the software. Because of that, LLamasoft already knows where much of its revenue will come from in the next two to three years. "We are really confident that this is now a company that is a long-term important company in the industry," Hicks said. "Success doesn't depend on doing something wildly different or new, success at this point depends on executing on a commitment to customers and being a well-run business." That's not to say the company isn't working toward introducing new features and programs for customers. Hicks says LLamasoft will soon release new products that will significantly help its customers. If those services are as well received by customers as LLamasoft anticipates, Hicks says the company may grow even quicker than imagined. And luckily for him he knows exactly where he can put new staff members. "This is the premier tech space in Michigan. I don't think you can come up with anything better," Hicks said.

The Federal Antimonopoly Service in September last year deemed Google in breach of a law on “protecting competition” after an investigation following a complaint by Russia’s largest search engine, Yandex. Yandex asked the anti-trust authorities to prevent Android phones from being automatically bundled with Google’s search engine. The FAS said that Google has two months to pay the fine. Yelena Zayeva, the head of its department for regulating communications and IT was quoted in the statement as saying the ruling “will allow the development of competition on the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive effect for consumers.” All companies whose production is on sale in Russia have to observe the law on competition, “including transnational corporations,” Zayeva added. Google said in a statement sent to AFP: “We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps.” “In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia,” Google said. The tech giant’s Android operating system dominates the smartphone market with a share of around 80 percent, which enables Google to offer search and other services to handset users. Russia’s anti-trust authority had been holding consultations with Google aimed at reaching an amicable agreement, but this required Google to admit guilt. Google has insisted that consumers are free to choose whether to use its services. Google has been hit by similar anti-trust charges in other countries, particularly in the European Union, which has launched three cases against Google, one of which is specifically about using the dominance of the Android mobile phone operating system to restrict competition. Russia’s anti-trust authority this week also launched legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of resellers’ prices for iPhones in the country. Apple said in a statement sent to AFP: “Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world.” Share to: Next Newer Post Previous Older Post Post a Comment Default Disqus nigerianeye 218168578325095 Nigeria News Comments are Moderated.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Alphabet Another High-Profile Executive Is Leaving Google Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Alphabet Another High-Profile Executive Is Leaving Google The departure comes on the first anniversary of the tech behemoth’s radical corporate restructuring. by Abigail Tracy August 11, 2016 9:48 am Email Facebook Twitter From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Exactly one year after Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin unveiled the radical corporate restructuring that created Alphabet, the parent company that now includes both Google and its more audacious “moonshot” projects, one of the company’s most notable execs announced his departure. Bill Maris, who built the Alphabet subsidiary Google Ventures into one of the most formidable venture-capital firms in Silicon Valley, is stepping down as C.E.O. of the finance arm. Maris, who founded GV in 2009 amid skepticism that it could become a prominent player in the V.C. world, said that he is leaving the company after eight years because he wants to spend more time with his family. “GV is seen as a premier venture capital operation around the world,” Maris said in an interview with Recode, which first reported news of his departure. “If it weren’t in great shape, that would be the wrong time to leave. I’m leaving because everything is great.” Maris’s decision to leave GV comes at an interesting time. Under Google’s curious new corporate structure, executives at Alphabet subsidiaries—which include the company’s more ambitious, speculative endeavors—are reportedly facing increased financial pressure under C.F.O. Ruth Porat. Citing anonymous sources, Recode reports that the reorganization “has rankled executives at these arms.” Maris will be the third high-profile executive to leave Alphabet in recent months, joining the ranks of former Nest C.E.O. Tony Fadell and Chris Urmson, previously C.T.O. and head of Google’s self-driving-car project. Maris, however, stressed that this had nothing to do with his decision to leave. “It has nothing to do with Alphabet. Because the change to Alphabet had little impact with us at all. We’ve been independent since day one.” David Krane, a managing partner at the venture division, will reportedly replace Maris, whose last day is this Friday, according to Recode. With Maris at the helm, GV clocked some notable wins including early investments in Uber, Slack, and Jet.com, which Walmart just acquired for $3 billion. A stand-alone firm under the Alphabet umbrella, GV currently manages $2.5 billion in capital.

The regulator has reviewed a complaint from the local search engine Yandex, which had filed a lawsuit against the US firm in 2015. Yandex is Google’s direct rival on the Russian market. Read more Google to face another European monopoly charge Yandex accuses Google of obliging smartphone producers to pre-install its services on gadgets and not allowing third-party services, such as Yandex’s search facility, to be pre-installed on Android-run devices. Google has 60 days to pay the penalty. The FAS says it intends to continue to hold settlement talks. "We have received a notification from the Federal Antimonopoly Service on the imposition of the fine. We will carefully review the decision before making next steps,” Google’s office in Russia told RT. Presidential adviser on the development of the internet, German Klimenko, has criticized the decision, calling on the FAS to fine Google each day until the violation is addressed, the way it is done in the US. "Our task is not to raise money but to ensure that the violation is eliminated. For Google, this fine is very small. It has much greater costs around the world, in particular, in the patent wars. Any figure smaller than $10 million is absolutely insignificant for Google,” he told TASS. Google services are used by 20.5 million Russians every month, while Yandex has 20.4 million users. However, Yandex is more popular as a homepage (12.3 million), while Google is only in third place, with 11 million users, behind social network VK.com’s 12.1 million.

SADA’s Public Cloud Survey also found a lot of promise for both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Services as the industry continues to grow. Among 200+ IT professionals surveyed, SADA says nearly half currently use Google Cloud Platform.  Other surveys shows comes in third worldwide. Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service also earn a significant portion.  This indicates many companies are using multiple platforms. Overall, SADA found 84% of those surveyed are using cloud infrastructure right now.  As always, security continues to be the biggest concern, but most are comfortable with utilizing off-site services. “All signs point to public cloud adoption growing and enterprise IT becoming more comfortable with the prospect of running their most sensitive data on public cloud infrastructure,” says Tony Safoian, president and CEO at SADA Systems. “Security and reliability will always be primary concerns – as they should – and companies should lean on expert consultants and integrators to guide them in addressing these issues. The convenience of public cloud, coupled with easy access to proven resources for managing these environments, make the option of moving to public cloud too compelling to ignore.” Explosive Growth Forecast Morgan Stanley predicts worldwide spending on public cloud services will double to $141 billion in 2019.  Those taking part in this survey agree, with nearly 75% saying they will increase use of cloud services by 25% to 50% in the next 2-3 years. With tens of billions of dollars at stake, the competition is fierce.  With Microsoft, Google and Amazon vying for that cash, they are spending a lot to get their share.  Just this week, Google launched a new price war with Amazon, slashing prices on off-site computing power.  The company also bought out a startup competing against Microsoft’s app services within the cloud. And familiarity could be Google’s secret weapon.  Because the vast majority of smartphones in use today run Android, IT leaders are naturally eyeing Google’s cloud services.  Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed say they’re likely to choose Google Cloud Services over Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. The bottom line, consumer and professional cloud services is the next great battleground for the “big 3.” As revenue in this sector climbs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, Microsoft and its competitors will feel the pressure to not only compete, but win decisively.

Special Report: Walkable Streets Site Plan for 560 Grays Road and Multi-Use Path - Updated The City's head of planning has clarified that the site plan for a new development planned at Grays Road and Frances Avenue will not replace the existing paved multi-use path with a sidewalk, forcing cyclists into vehicle traffic. By Viv Saunders Published August 11, 2016 This article has been updated. Editor's Note: Jason Thorne, the General Manager of Planning and Economic Development for the City, has clarified in a response to RTH that the multi-use path will not be affected by this development. The city giveth and the city taketh away. The development is planned for the block bounded by Grays Road, Frances Avenue, Drakes Drive and North Service Road (Image Credit: Google Maps) At this week's Planning Committee meeting, a new Conceptual Plan for a development at 560 Grays Road was presented. When the applicant's representative displayed the plan, the public learned for the first time that the existing multi-use path on Frances Avenue will be replaced with a sidewalk. Paved multi-use path on the side of Frances Avenue (Image Credit: Google) Multi-use path on Frances Avenue (right side) at intersection with Grays Road (Image Credit: Google) The Zoning Amendment Application (Item 6.2 in the Planning Committee agenda) states: New 1.5 m wide concrete sidewalks will be required to be constructed by the developer on the north side of Frances Avenue between Grays Road and Drakes Drive and along Drakes Drive southerly to the north limit of the proposed driveway entrance. An internal sidewalk is also recommended which would provide a connection from the proposed building to the intersection of Drakes Drive and Frances Avenue. This particular multi-use path is the result of years of pleading to address the safety concerns associated with the previous gravel shoulder. It is now a paved route that is used continually by cyclists and pedestrians. This is a heavily-used cycling path that is used by hundreds of cyclists to enter Confederation Beach Park for recreational cycling and is the desired path for Ontario Waterfront Trail users in order to avoid the narrow and congested Drakes Drive. The Waterfront Trail runs along the paved multi-use path on Frances Avenue This particular path also provides connectivity to the QEW pedestrian overpass, Cannon bike lanes, and Skyway Bridge for those who choose to cycle to work. While not a designated route, for safety reasons and travel time, it is definitely the desired route and is well used. Approval of the rezoning at 560 Grays Road approved the removal of this path with a sidewalk replacement, which will result in cyclists having to once again share the road. The road network is also a designated truck route in this section of our residential streets. Now cyclists will be forced to share the road with vehicle and truck traffic. This appears to be a big step in the wrong direction. It is counter-intuitive to Vision Zero and other Council-supported mandates. Approval of this rezoning plan places the city's desire for infill development ahead of the public's need for safe active modes of transportation. Proposed Site Plan: Planning Report PED16158, Appendix D We originally supported this development after having great dialogue with the developer's representative, but now we're finding out health and safety remedial measures have not been adequately dealt with during the planning process. We believe approval is premature and the motion to approve rezoning of 560 Grays Road should be tabled at this Friday's Council meeting. Good land-use planning should include enhancement to existing infrastructure, not its reduction or removal. A concrete plan should be worked out during the public process of rezoning, not behind closed doors and without public input during the Site Plan process. Generally speaking, cycling paths are the first things to be axed when dealing with limited infrastructure resources. Experience has taught us a "let's wait and see" what is agreed to after the fact (by people who do not live in our community)is likely to be a lunch bag we're disappointed with. Lakewood Beach Community Council is a neighbourhood association located in Hamilton/Stoney Creek. Our advocacy efforts are focused on enhancing a community that is healthy, safe and respectful of our natural environment. Update: According to Jason Thorne, General Manager of Planning and Economic Development for the City, the approved site plan for 560 Grays Road will not impact the multi-use path on Frances Avenue: The proposed development at 560 Grays Road does not affect the multi-use path on Frances Avenue. The development approval for 560 Grays Road includes our standard requirement to add sidewalks, which would occur around the perimeter of the site, and the details of this are done through the site plan approval process. The multi-use path on Frances Avenue isn't affected by the development. That said, the Cycling Master Plan has identified Frances Avenue for possible cycling improvements that may include a dedicated bike lane, separate from a walking path or sidewalk for pedestrians. That will be determined through the Cycling Master Plan update. Viv Saunders has loved living in six different wards of Hamilton.

That would be where North Service Road gets a "Proposed 6.0M road widening." Permalink | Context By Suburbanite (anonymous) | Posted August 11, 2016 at 12:42:52 in reply to Comment 119789 Kevin, what am I missing? Do you mind expanding. The road widening is likely going to accommodate a turning lane into the new Confed Park entrance that will be located just west of Grays Road; assuming it will fit under the Gray's road bridge/overpass which was just rebuilt. Permalink | Context [ - ] By Suburbanite (anonymous) | Posted August 11, 2016 at 15:14:46 The perimeter of the property is the south side of Frances Avenue. The Staff Report clearly states a sidewalk on the north side of Frances, which is where the existing multi-use path is located. Appears decisions are being rushed through at Council based on misinformation and confusion. Mistakes happen, but even the developer thinks he has to put a sidewalk in where the path is.

Meet the Contributors → As U.S. Looks to Launch Precision Health Study, Google’s Role Emerges Alex Lash August 11th, 2016 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  The U.S. government has ambitious plans for a long-term health study with one million Americans, and one of the world’s most powerful tech companies has a big part to play, including the storage of all the data on its “cloud” servers. Google’s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and its wholly owned biotech R&D group, Verily Life Sciences, are helping build a secure center where health records, genomic data, and other personal information from hundreds of thousands of people can be collected, analyzed, and shared with health researchers. The federal initiative is expected to generate a trove of health information, to be gathered from “a rich diversity” of volunteers across the country, as National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins noted last month. While many details remain vague, Google’s deep involvement comes as other key participants in the national effort—called the Precision Medicine Initiative—are raising concerns about the growing reach of tech giants like Google and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) into healthcare. Those concerns are shared by the public. In a survey published this summer by digital health investment firm Rock Health, respondents were generally positive about sharing their health records and genetic data. But they did not view tech companies as trustworthy stewards. In fact, tech companies shared the lowest marks along with government, which underlines one of the national study’s big question marks: how quickly will people sign up for an effort whose premise—the more volunteers, the deeper the insights into ever-more tailored medical treatments and preventive health—requires mass participation? Collins, whose organization is overseeing much of the initiative, raised the question last month, even as he announced a goal to start recruitment by November, only four months away. “We’re curious to know whether we’ll be deluged or have to work harder to get the word out,” Collins said. PMI officials acknowledged the importance of gaining the public’s trust. “It’s front and center in every decision we’re making,” said Gwynne Jenkins, the chief of staff for the PMI cohort program, the team building the volunteer database. To be clear, health data that citizens contribute to the study will be open for research under the purview of the government—not held privately by Google or the other two dozen entities that are building and running the four cornerstones of the PMI. Only a few of those entities are for-profit companies; Google, via Verily, is the highest-profile. Its participation was first publicly revealed in February, when the Obama administration unveiled a pilot project run by Vanderbilt University and Verily to test volunteer attitudes and potential recruitment strategies. The two organizations were going to build an online “portal”—a term from the old dot-com days that described the efforts of Yahoo, Microsoft, and others to attract Web surfers with search, news, and other information. Verily chief medical officer Jessica Mega said in June her group was well suited to help because of its experience with user interfaces and “the right cadence of engaging people.” Verily’s role has since shifted, however. When Collins announced in July the four multi-million-dollar cornerstone PMI projects, the Vanderbilt-Verily group was put in charge not of recruitment but of an entirely different piece: a coordinating center, headquartered at Vanderbilt’s medical center in Nashville, TN, that will gather all the data generated by the nationwide study and make the information available to researchers. The first year of the grant for the Data and Research Support Center is worth $13.6 million, with potentially $72 million over five years. Vanderbilt is the lead contractor. It was “always the plan” to apply for the coordinating center job, said Vanderbilt associate professor of biomedical informatics Joshua Denny, the school’s PMI point man. Vanderbilt had a head start stumping for it. A top spot for health informatics research, the school already houses a national research center for electronic medical records and genomics, funded by the NIH’s National Human Genome Research Institute. Joining Vanderbilt and Verily is the Broad Institute of Cambridge, MA. The Broad will contribute its expertise generating and working with vast genomic data sets, as well as sophisticated tools to help researchers make sense of the data the PMI aims to collect. So where does Verily fit in? Its parent company does data infrastructure and analytics like few other entities on Earth. Vanderbilt’s Denny told Xconomy that the PMI data center would use the Google Cloud data storage platform. (Google has a division of its cloud business tailored to genomics data. It even has a price guide.) But Verily itself is best known as a kind of blue-sky lab for device-centered health projects, such as a “smart” contact lens to monitor a diabetic’s glucose level, or electro-implants to rewire a patient’s disease. It’s the life science version of the Google X think tank that has produced Google Glass and the self-driving car initiative. Verily also aims to run its own long-term health study, called Baseline, which is not affiliated with the PMI. But why it, and not Google, needs to be a front-facing entity on the PMI data center project—even one dedicated to healthcare data—is less clear. Verily officials insist that their group, not Google, be identified as the PMI contractor. When asked what health expertise Verily would bring to the table beyond Google’s data management systems, officials with Verily (and everyone else Xconomy interviewed for this article) were quick to caution … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 3 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor.

The move made sense from a consistency point of view, considering that DuckDuckGo had been the default search engine for some time in Pale Moon. That was not the only reason however why the team made the decision to switch the search engine of the browser's start page to DuckDuckgo. According to the announcement, another reason for making the change was a conflict with Google over policy violations on the start page. As you may know, the search engine traffic on that start page is a big portion of what gives me the income to make Pale Moon work at no cost to its users. Unfortunately Google has been pretty much cutting me off with claiming it is "invalid traffic" and that it would be a policy violation just because the browser is downloadable software. Users who prefer Google over DuckDuckGo could switch to Google using the pulldown menu, or simply change the homepage of the browser to google.com as the new start page. This was not the end of the story though for the Pale Moon team. Three days later, the team stated that it made the decision to remove Google Search completely from Pale Moon. Further communication with Google's ad traffic quality team caused the issue to escalate. As a follow-up to the problems indicated in our previous announcement, Google's "Ad Traffic Quality Team" has decided to interpret their policies that are geared to preventing toolbars and external programs from changing user settings for home pages and similar as "you may not have a Google Search box on the default home page", basically trying to determine for us what our out-of-the-box-experience (OOBE) should be. Pale Moon's solution to Google trying to force them to modify the out of box experience is a complete removal of Google Search from the browser. This has not happened yet, and it is unclear how the removal will look like. Pale Moon users may still go to Google and run searches manually there, or use the !g bang of DuckDuckGo to redirect searches to google. We asked Moonchild, owner and lead developer of Pale Moon and will update the post as soon as we get an answer. Update: Moonchild told us that users will still be able to add Google Search manually to the browser by adding it as a search plugin to Pale Moon. Also, users are free to set the home page to any address they want, including Google's.

DaveyK August 12, 2016 at 1:49 pm # The engine is getting a little old now admittedly, although v27 is already available in alpha with a much more up-to-date Gecko back end, so this should be improved in due course. But "too much restrictions"? Compared with what? It's far more flexible and customisable than Edge, Firefox, Chrome or IE. That's the main reason I use it. That and the devs typically only make a functional change to the browser if there's a good reason to do so, as opposed to Mozilla that keep adding and removing things on a whim every time the wind changes direction. ask August 11, 2016 at 3:54 pm # it can still be added to search box manually right?

OK, that's a lie, I remove it from the list of Search Engines (and disable automatic Search Engine updates) as soon as I install PM. But, to my simple thinking StartPage is a better Search Engine. StartPage claim (but who can you trust with money involved?) to be fully transparent and logging-free. Using DDG does not free you from some tracking, albeit non-personalized, but your search request and results are scanned by DDG on behalf of data miners. They have to monetize, I understand that, but I think there are better options. Having said that, I have been wrong before. :) Try using WireShark while browsing and prepare to be amazed. For now anyway, StartPage is my go to search. Reply Liv August 11, 2016 at 6:52 pm # I have tried many search engines in PM but nothing comes even remotely close to ever replacing DDG for me. I even have to switch the search provider on other web browsers to DDG I'm so used to it being default. Reply Tom Hawack August 11, 2016 at 5:39 pm # If I ever switch back to Pale Moon knowing that Google is no longer in the default search engines list would definitely be good news. Users know Google from the sunny side of the street but I've often heard site admins complain of how ferocious Google is when it comes to business, to the point of positioning those who bring the company big money as lucky to have been accepted : power allows reversing the charges. Free of Google, account as well as search (only maps and sometimes images), cookies blocked for all Google sites, strong filters to limit as much as possible the GQuest, I nevertheless respect the excellency of its services even if I deplore its universal tentacles : too much is why I've put a space between them and I. Bravo Moonchild for having the necessary determination. I'm not surprised. Remains the loss of income. Reply RG August 11, 2016 at 7:01 pm # I just want a browser that works well with modern standards but doesn't eat my CPU. For over a decade from XP to Fedora, Mint, Win7, Win10 using everything like Pentium 4 to Core Duo to i5 ... still waiting. PM isn't it either. The search continues. Reply Birmingham August 11, 2016 at 8:11 pm # Google search has always been overrated. Who needs a billion results that are increasingly unrelated and poor from page 4. I'm fine with alternatives like DuckDuckGo and not supporting Google's godfatherism. One more reason to use Pale Moon. Reply gh August 11, 2016 at 8:28 pm # duckandgo just never cuts the mustard each time I give it a try. Its results pages seem to continually steer me toward yahoo-owned sites.

Reply Birmingham August 12, 2016 at 12:09 am # I didn't say DDG is my dream search, but I am FINE with Google alternatives, who don't give me many shopping results on the first pages and track all my searches and clicks. - Didn't notice this Yahoo Answers thing yet. Anonymous August 12, 2016 at 1:57 am # That's exactly why I don't use DDG. Private or not, Yahoo search results suck and are weighed heavily towards advertisers.

Tom Hawack August 12, 2016 at 2:19 pm # DDG has many nice features and has added a time filter (the 'Anytime' button), unfortunately includes only Day, Week and Month : why not Year as well?! DDG remains my favorite together with Startpage (Google only) and Ixquick (other search engines without Google) and, exceptionally (when I'm on such a good mood that I forget the falcons and hear but the birds' whistling) I call Encrypted Google Web Search (I'm seldom on such good moods).

Reply PM4NOW August 13, 2016 at 8:51 pm # PM or not-the-latest-FF, this is the way to browse. This cutting edge mania is really obnoxious and is either misunderstood by those who "upgrade" - no matter what will be broken - or even pushed... as if a latest-greatest version could give you internet points as a bonus. Does it work? Good, do NOT change it. Reply wonton August 14, 2016 at 6:51 pm # @PM4NOW there is a difference between "cutting edge" and "current web standards" the engine used in pale moon was forked from firefox 24 esr their have been extensive improvements in web technologies that pale moon lacks in ones that have being used all over the internet for years. now they have to race to re fork the browser on a new engine as they finally admit they are very behind in the tech with bad web compatibility just like windows xp to windows 7. but the same will happen after this coming re branch 27 base from 38 most of this is not cutting edge as it was released in Firefox a year or more ago but pale moon is yet to catch up. without re branching pale moon based from firefox 24 esr will simply be completely unusable in no time with a slow death. this whole google thing started when ask to remove a post in there forums http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=12193 that blatantly falsely accuses them of malice typical slander moonchild refused so they stopped paying ad revenue until resolved he refused so now has no google ads. how the google custom search was used is against its tos if used correctly there is no issue. two sides to a coin so far we only heard moonchilds were is googles official response @Martin Brinkmann should ask google for a comment.

Reply clas August 14, 2016 at 1:22 pm # to old coot: i believe a browser is a personal choice. most are like any other program and you have to work with them and get used to them and make your own little changes and tweaks with fonts and sizes and addons. only after using one for a while can you really make an informed decision. just because you have used one for years does not make it the best one, maybe only the best one for you. i have tried them all and given all of them a good and fair run. i have decided that pale moon is the one for me. its not cutting edge, but then thats one of the things i like. i have been keeping up with this rat-race of constant change for decades and i am tired of doing it. palemoon gives me a break. everything works for me and its a constant in my life. so why not give it a try. its free. it only takes a little effort. set it up and make the changes you want to get it to be yours....then use it a couple times a day...and go from there. Reply Moon Child August 14, 2016 at 7:58 pm # @wonton: "Current web standards" as HTML5? That's the only one. This cutting edge madness has to be stopped. Reply jm August 16, 2016 at 11:53 am # I tried Palemoon some years ago and found that it didn't work with all or only worked partially on some sites like banking and some webshops. Palemoon has moved forward and now supports all sites I want to use so it's now my only browser. PM developers seems to aim at security for the user rather than to feed large companies that spy on us. I have been looking for that for years. It hit me that the sites it didn't work on was usually sites that wasn't safe to use anyway. No, I don't mean adult one's but rather sites loaded with complex scripting that would run and download all kinds of stuff onto my computer. Maybe it's time for all us who are using and enjoying Palemoon to show our support to keep development going. If all PM users donated 5$ or whatever one large coffee cost in your country I'm sure we will get rewarded with an even better browser.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 11, 2016 9:02am   Comments Share: Related AEO Pre-Thanksgiving Rally In Abercrombie 'Full Of Stuffing, Not Meat' Watch These 5 Huge Put Purchases In Wednesday Trade Margin improvement lights a candle in retail (Seeking Alpha) Google Trends data indicates that American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO) is poised to beat 2Q expectations, despite challenging comps, Wunderlich’s Eric Beder said in a report. He upgraded the rating on the company from Hold to Buy, while raising the price target from $13 to $22. Upside Potential In 2Q Google Trends data indicates upside potential for American Eagle in 2Q. “Of the 10 brands we analyzed via the statistical/linear-regression process, American Eagle posted the highest YoY growth in search-term interest, with Google search popularity for the teen retail brand increasing 7.9% YoY,” analyst Beder wrote. This would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of positive y/y gains for the brand, and the seventh straight quarter of sequentially better y/y search-term trends. There appears to be a 52 percent probability of American Eagle generating at least 6 percent revenue growth in the quarter, which is significantly higher than the consensus expectation of 2.6 percent growth. There is also a 95 percent probability of the company reported at least 2.1 percent sales growth for 2Q, Beder mentioned. The data highlights that the company is “moving even closer to a lifestyle brand focused business with an emphasis on denim and innovation,” the analyst commented, while adding, “Given that 2Q faces the toughest comparisons (a +11% comp in the corresponding quarter) for the fiscal year, by far, we believe a result this strong would lead investors to view AEO even more favorably.” Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga? Please email feedback@benzinga.com with your best article ideas.

The Split View and Slide Over feature that Apple introduced last year with the iOS 9 made multitasking on the iPad a whole lot easier. Soon after, many developers including Google began updating their apps to support Split View and Slide Over multitasking. Google has been slowly updating its iOS apps over the months. It began by updating Chrome to support Split View multitasking feature for iPad back in October, and also added the support for apps such as Google Photos and YouTube. In March, Google updated the Google Docs app for iPad Pro that brought native resolution support but was still missing the multitasking features.The Slide Over feature allows users to see an app over other running apps, while the Split View feature allows the user to run two apps side-by-side in equal or adjustable windows. These features for Google Docs means iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4 users can now simultaneously edit their documents and browse the net or social media apps like Twitter without having to close one or the other. The multitasking feature will make editing, researching and browsing a whole lot smoother and convenient. Apart from the Split View and Slide Over support, the update also includes some bug fixes and improvements. The update also supports inserting images and page breaks in Docs. All three updates app are available on the App Store. In the meanwhile, Google has also updated its Docs, Sheets, and Slides apps for Android, bringing improved table and chart functionality, reports Android Police. Users can now copy cells from a Sheets worksheet to Docs or Slides, and get a formatted table as a result. This new functionality applies to copied cells not more than 400 in number. Sheets' chart functionality has also been improved, specifically with they way they are drawn. The updated apps will roll out gradually to all users.

"There are no words that could tell the story of how you illuminated every life you touched," Ashley McNiff, a longtime friend of Marcotte, posted Tuesday on Facebook. "I don't want to believe you're gone. I will never be able to comprehend why this happened to you." Marcotte, a 27-year-old Google account executive, was killed Sunday while out for a run in Princeton near her mother's home. She was a former Leominster resident who was living in New York City. McNiff wrote that her friend was the best daughter, niece, cousin and friend in the world. Vanessa Marcotte Sentinel and Enterprise staff photos can be ordered by visiting our SmugMug site. "I am devastated and numb," she wrote, "but I promise when I think of you I will always try to find joy in remembering your beautiful and spunky soul, your infectious smile and laugh, our philosophical conversations, and how you taught me to reclaim my mornings and focus on gratitude. I love you always and forever." Carolyn Lavin, a Needham resident who worked with Marcotte for two years at Vistaprint, said Marcotte "never had a bad day." "She was beautiful and was loved by her peers," Lavin said. Lavin recalled when Marcotte joined Vistaprint in November 2012 as a paid search specialist. "Vanessa was probably the warmest person I have ever worked with," she said. "She was incredibly warm. She would just look at you and smile. Advertisement She was just the nicest person in a corporate world." Several of Marcotte's childhood friends responded to requests for comment by deferring to the family's request for privacy. All of Leominster was in mourning Wednesday evening at a vigil in support of Marcotte's family, including her father, John, who still lives in the city. The vigil, which included prayer and musical selections, took place on the city common outside of City Hall on Wednesday, starting at 7 p.m. Leominster Mayor Dean Mazzarella asked that residents "take time out of their day to show the family our city's support" by attending the vigil. "You can''t comprehend the feeling of this," Mazzarella said. "The feeling has been shock." Mazzarella said he knows the family, but he didn't want to get too personal because the family has requested their privacy following the murder of their daughter. "Just hard-working, honest, dedicated, loyal, good people," Mazzarella said describing the Marcotte family. "The best of the best in any way or value you could imagine." Other people who knew the family attended the vigil to support them and make everyone aware of the person Vanessa was and the type of family the Marcotte's are. Mary Brooks, of Fitchburg, bows her head in prayer during the vigil in memory of Leominster-born Vanessa Marcotte. Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. confirmed during a press conference on Monday that the body of missing jogger and former Leominster resident Marcotte, 27, had been found in Princeton and that her death is being investigated as a homicide. SENTINEL & ENTERPRISE / Ashley Green "Knowing the tragedy this family is going through and the heartbreak and the loss," said Brenda Giambrocco, who knows Vanessa's mother. "Support is all we can ask for in this crazy world we live in." Leominster resident Debra Phillips came to the vigil to offer the Marcotte family support and a gift. She brought a framed picture of Vanessa Marcotte that included words of prayers and thoughts to her family. "She is from Leominster so we support her," Phillips, who does not know the family, said. "We support anyone who comes into our life." The tragedy of Marcotte's murder also sent shock waves beyond Central Massachusetts, illustrating the impact she had on all those who knew her. Both her employer, Google, and her alma mater, Boston University, released statements on their "shock and sadness" in response to Marcotte's death. Tom Fiedler, dean of the College of Communication at Boston University, wrote in a Tuesday statement that "Vanessa's bright future and impact in the industry was only just beginning." "Her vibrant spirit will continue to shine the way for all of our future students," Fielder wrote. Communications professor Steven Quigley, who knew Marcotte as a student, said she was "kind, very bright and unfailingly gracious." "My heart is broken, and my thoughts are with her family," Quigley said. The statement from Google said Marcotte was "a much-loved member of the Google team . .. known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports." Lavin said she remembered when Marcotte left Vistaprint for Google at the end of 2014. "We were really close," Lavin said. "We really were super-excited for her. I was also really sad because we were leading a project together. I was sad to watch her go because I enjoyed working with her so much. She was just good. She was just warm." Lavin was sad to see "people and data person" leave their company, but Lavin was also losing her shopping partner. Vistaprint allowed employees to have packages shipped to the office. "Amazon was there every week for Vanessa Marcotte and Carolyn Lavin," she said recalling their shopping sprees. "We would just walk by each other and say, 'Oops.'" Lavin's mother called while she was on her way home from work Monday. When her mother asked if she knew Marcotte, she pulled over and began to "cry hysterically." "I was sick to my stomach," she said. "It was horrific what happened to her because she was going to leave an impression on the world that there is goodness in everyone. In the corporate world, she never had a corporate persona. She was just good." Marcotte's killer has not yet been caught. David Procopio, the spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police, said Wednesday that the police had no new information. He urged anyone who may have information related to the homicide to contact the State Police tip line at 508-453-7589. On Tuesday, investigators in Massachusetts were working with New York City police to determine if there is a connection between Marcotte's murder and the murder of Karina Vetrano, 30, who was killed while jogging in the Queens borough of New York City on Aug. 2. It was unknown Wednesday if they are still investigating a possible link.

State-owned telecoms company Sputnik spent the whopping sum – employing more than 25% of the population – since being launched in May 2014. Today Russian Government department the Federal Antimonopoly Service announced it was fining Google 438 million rubles – £5,200,908 – "for violation of competition in the market for mobile applications". President Vladimir Putin launched Sputnik after saying privately-owned Russian search engine Yandex is subject to "western influence" and not a true national search engine. But Yandex is massively popular, with millions of page visits in the country every day. Sputnik, which was developed over two years by Rostelecom and has no links to the state news agency that shares its name, receives just 4,000 searches a day in comparison to Google's 40,000 every second, according to online statistics.

In the early years of his rule, Putin dismissed the internet as "50% porn". In 2014, the Russian parliament passed a law requiring foreign social media websites to keep their servers in Russia and save all information about their users for at least six months.

Blogger and Kremlin critic Rustem Adagamov told the Times: "Rostelecom has pilfered more than two billion roubles through this search engine project, which absolutely no-one needs."

By Liam Tung | August 11, 2016 -- 10:19 GMT (03:19 PDT) | Topic: Security Google is rolling out profile alerts for email that hasn't been authenticated. Image: Google Google is enabling new security warnings in Gmail to combat phishing and other threats posed by spoofed email accounts and malicious links. More security news Catastrophic botnet to smash social media networks in 2017 DoD, HackerOne kick off Hack the Army bug bounty challenge ATM hacks in 'more than a dozen' European countries in 2016: Group IB Windows 10 tip: Keep your Microsoft account secure with 2-factor authentication The new warnings should go some way to countering email-spoofing tactics that are frequently used in phishing and the multi-billion dollar scam known as business email compromise (BEC). Over the next few days, Gmail on the web and on Android devices will display a question mark next to a sender's profile pic, corporate logo, or avatar if the message can't be authenticated. The checks are done against Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records or the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) standard, which allows the sender to sign legitimate email digitally. Gmail users can currently check whether an email is authenticated by opening the email and clicking the down arrow next to the sender's name. If it is authenticated, the message will display a 'signed-by' header with the sending domain, and a 'mailed-by' head with the domain name. The new warnings make these details more obvious to end users. The new avatar warnings follow Google's decision last year to adopt the DMARC protocol, which is short for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance, also to combat phishing. DMARC allows domain owners to tell Gmail how to handle unauthenticated messages from that domain. However, to put this measure in place, domain owners first needed to configure SPF and DKIM on all outbound email. The end-user warnings rolling out on Gmail may apply more pressure on domain owners to authenticate outbound email. Google notes that not all emails that display the warnings will necessarily be dangerous, but warns users to take extra caution when opening them. The other security warning is rolling out only to Gmail on the web and is an extension of Google's Safe Browsing technology, which is used by Chrome, Safari, and Firefox to alert users to potentially malicious web pages. Now, if a message in Gmail contains a link to a site that's known by Safe Browsing as bad, users will see a full-page security alert, warning them not to proceed.

(Reuters/Mike Blake, Reuters/Mike Blake, AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong August 11, 2016 Leaving a top spot at Alphabet is all the rage these days, it seems. Bill Maris, who oversees Alphabet’s unit for early-stage venture capital investments, GV (formerly Google Ventures), is the third senior executive at the tech conglomerate to leave since June, Recode reported. GV’s website now lists David Krane, a partner who invested in Nest and Uber, as the fund’s chief executive and managing partner. Maris no longer appears on the fund’s executive profiles page. We have contacted GV for confirmation and will update this post when it responds. Maris’s exit follows the departure of Chris Urmson, who led the technical team on Google’s self-driving car project, on Aug. 5, and Tony Fadell, chief executive of the home-appliance maker Nest, who left in June. Under Maris, GV had a remit to invest in a wide range of companies, using the $400 million its corporate parent gave it annually. It put that cash to work with consumer technology companies like Uber and Nest; health and life sciences firms (a Maris favorite) like genetics-testing firm 23andMe; enterprise software companies like messaging app Slack; and robotics companies like commercial 3D-printing firm Carbon3D. Maris had notable investing successes, like Uber and Jet.com, which was recently sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion. His background in life sciences (he studied neuroscience and helped develop a lens for cataract blindness) helped him avoid pumping money into Theranos, a once heralded blood-testing startup gone wrong (paywall). But GV also had some rough patches under his watch, like the closure of its European venture fund a year after it launched. The fund’s London-based partners clashed with Maris, who insisted on calling the shots (paywall) from Mountain View. Business Insider also reported that European partners were expected to have their investments vetted by an in-house algorithm, potentially leading to fewer deals. Google announced a reorganization into a conglomerate called Alphabet a year ago. The idea was to give each Alphabet unit greater autonomy from the ad-driven Google search business. While Google has flourished under Sundar Pichai, who was handed the reins when Alphabet was created, the conglomerate’s “Other Bets” unit hasn’t fared so well. Alphabet’s revenues are still overwhelmingly dependent on Google, with its other subsidiaries suffering heavy losses. The latest high-profile departures suggest that the executives who once ran Alphabet’s riskiest ventures see better odds elsewhere.

A group of former Google executives and early investors have teamed up in a bid to revolutionize mobile advertising and — they hope — make it more enjoyable to attend baseball games. Xperiel, a Sunnyvale, California-based start-up, introduced itself to the public on Thursday and announced $7 million in financing from some heavy hitters in technology and sports, including the Los Angeles Dodgers and Major League Baseball. Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim and early Amazon.com executive Ram Shriram — two of the first investors in Google — joined the party. The founders of Xperiel are brothers Alex and Philipp Hertel, who previously created software that became the basis for Google Wallet. Xperiel's technology is designed to link all the data from the many sensors that surround us and combine that with a consumer's interests in order to create personal experiences on mobile phones. There are all sorts of web-connected devices everywhere we go, but they don't talk to each other, and certainly don't talk to ordinary people. Why not take advantage of that data and use the information to present more relevant offers and incentives to smartphone users, replacing the annoying internet-like ads that we currently see on our devices? Source: Xperiel Alex Hertel, co-founder of Xperiel The Hertel brothers gave a demo to a group of reporters in San Francisco earlier this week, using the Dodgers as an example of a customer. Dodger Stadium's ticket scanners, concession stands, iBeacons, scoreboards and Jumbotrons all have sensors. Surely those devices can connect in a way that makes sitting through a nine-inning game more tolerable. "There's a huge amount of technology in a stadium, bit it's all siloed right now," said Alex Hertel, the CEO. "We take all the technology in a stadium and we unify it." At Dodger Stadium, that could mean getting a digital puzzle piece after scanning a ticket and another for buying a drink. Get all four pieces and collect a bobblehead. Hertel was quick to emphasize that sporting events are just one application. The company has created a platform for designers and marketers to easily create and customize experiences for their clients. Pepsi executives were also at the launch and talked about using Xperiel for events with big corporate clients. Like with any early-stage start-up, Xperiel faces a laundry list of challenges. After all, the technology to date has only been tested by select companies. But Xperiel has collected quite the roster of support. Additional investors include VMware co-founder Diane Greene (who now runs Google's cloud), Intuit co-founder Scott Cook and Stanford University President John Hennessy as well Golden State Warriors part owner Dave Scially and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp.

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store.

On the one hand, it helps test Google’s technical abilities as well as its clout in the Internet provider industry. On the other hand, the company seems to be doing a “two steps forward, one step back” dance and it’s almost impossible to predict where lightning will strike next. Well, according to an uncovered FCC filing, lightning will actually strike 24 locations in the US where Google has requested permission to test its newer, faster wireless technologies. 24 locations, which includes 12 cities, is no small number. That’s even more than the currently supported Google Fiber locations spread throughout the country. Indeed, some locations are already enjoying Google Fiber, while others, like Provo, Utah and Reston, Virginia, are totally new targets. Here’s the full list of those 24 locations: • Phoenix, Arizona • Atwater, California • Los Angeles, California • Mountain View, California • Palo Alto, California • San Bruno, California • San Francisco, California • San Jose, California • Boulder, Colorado • Tampa, Florida • Atlanta, Georgia • Chicago, Illinois • Des Moines, Iowa • Kansas City. Kansas • Omaha, Nebraska • Las Vegas, Nevada • New York, New York • Raleigh. North Carolina • Oklahoma City, Oklahoma • Portland, Oregon • Austin, Texas • Provo, Utah • Blacksburg, Virginia • Reston, Virginia The reason for the sudden jump in numbers is believed to be two-fold. The first is that Google is seeking to test its new wireless transmission technology that courses through the 3.4 to 3.8 GHz bands, which, while considerably bumps up speeds, also puts it in a collision course with other users of those bands, including military radar systems. Google’s confidence in those numbers is also due to its acquisition of the Webpass service provider last June. Webpass already delivers fiber Internet to a lot more locations than Google Fiber covers, and piggybacking on Webpass’ existing infrastructure allows it to bypass many regulatory processes. As to when the tests will begin, that will, of course, depend on FCC approval. It will be a closed party anyway, so consumers will just have to wait for Google to get its act together.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social QuadRooter Security issue: Google says most devices are protected QuadRooter Security issue: Google says most devices are protected Google has responded to the QuadRooter vulnerability, saying devices with Apps Verification are protected. By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 4, 2016 9:56 am Google said it is aware of the Quadrooter issue, and Android phones running the latest security patch are already protected against it. (Source: Reuters) Google has responded to the QuadRooter vulnerability, that is believed to affect over 900 million Qualcomm chipset-powered Android phones.  The Search giant said it is aware of the issue, and Android phones running the latest security patch are already protected against three of the security flaws pointed out. Google issued a statement to AndroidCentral and a spokesperson for the company said, “The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2016-5340, will be addressed in an upcoming Android security bulletin, though Android partners can take action sooner by referencing the public patch Qualcomm has provided.” Google also added the Verify Apps and SafetyNet protections are designed to block any such application which has malware and can block apps, which choose to exploit vulnerabilities like QuadRooter. The apps verification feature has been part of Google’s Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and is enabled by default. Apps Verification is useful because it ensures that downloads from outside the Google Play Store are scanned for malware before and after you install them on your device. Google says this works for all apps and ensures the QuadRooter vulnerability is not exploited by any malicious app. The security issue was revealed security firm Check Point Software Technologies at the annual security conference DEF CON 24 in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to the report, QuadRooter is a set of four vulnerabilities affecting Android devices running on Qualcomm chipsets. Using any of these four vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit a device by gaining root access to a user’s phone, or trigger privilege escalation by the use of a malicious app. Also read: QuadRooter vulnerability leaves 900 mn Qualcomm-powered Android phones at risk Genelia Deshmukh On Being A Mother And Bollywood Career Bigg Boss 10 November 22 Review: Bani Lashes Out At Swami Om, Manoj Punjabi Demonetisation: Supreme Court Refuses To Stay Proceedings Why Is Jammu Kashmir’s Machil Sector Seen As A Safe Passage For Infiltrators Amartya Sen No Longer Part Of Nalanda University Board Government Plans To Bring GST Bills As Money Bills: Here’s Why Demonetisation: Relief For Common Man: Find Out More Salman Khan And Family Celebrate Helen’s Birthday At Galaxy Apartments Demonetisation: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Defends Government’s Move Aamir Khan’s Dangal Pales In Comparison To Surroundings Of Mahavir Singh Phogat’s Village J&K: 3 Soldiers Killed, Body Of One Mutilated In Machhal Sector PM Narendra Modi Asks People To Rate Demonetisation Ex-Gujarat Energy Minister Has Financial Interest In 8 Onshore Oil Blocks: Find Out More US President-Elect Donald Trump Lays Out Agenda For First 100 Days Modi Keynote Prank App Spurns Several Clones The security firm had found the issue existed with Qualcomm’s software drivers that come with its chipset, and it can only be fixed with a software patch from the carrier, who can only push it after receiving a patch from Qualcomm.  Qualcomm was told about these vulnerabilities by the team in April this year. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

Lifestyle London Life How to free up space on your iPhone without deleting your apps Because you couldn’t possibly part with Pokémon GO… Gabby Martin Thursday 11 August 2016 11:36 BST Don't sacrifice your apps Shutterstock There's nothing worse than seeing the ‘not enough storage’ warning pop up on your iPhone during a prime photo opportunity. Sure, we all know to delete pointless apps, but what about when you've whittled down your home screen to the essentials? Luckily, you don't have to strip back your smarphone to be able to snap away to your heart's content. Try these five space-saving tips instead: 1. Google Photos Photos are generally the guilty party that dominate the lion's share of your storage. The solution? Donwload Google Photos. This space-saving app gives you 5GB of extra storage to file away your endless stream of selfies for free. 2. Get hacking Read more I’m a recovering alcoholic - now I get a fix from playing Pokémon GO Reddit user eavesdroppingyou has revealed a sneaky tip for freeing up storage: simply attempt to rent a film from the iTunes store that is larger than your available storage. You don't want to accidently rent something that will fit on your phone as then you'll be charged, so choose something hefty like Cleopatra (10.3 GB) or Lawrence of Arabia (8.19GB) to be on the safe side. Your iPhone will then pop up with a message advising you that you don’t have enough available storage to rent the film. When this happens, click on ‘Settings’ and your iPhone will automatically do a spring-clean of data, freeing up some space.  3. Avoid burst photos Have a quick scroll through your photos and check if you're harbouring any burst photos.  Burst mode is a handy feature that takes up to 10 frames per second so you don't miss the best shot, which is especially useful when taking an action photo.  However, it may also mean that you're be sitting on hundreds of indentical images, taking up valuable space on your phone.  Save the best of the bunch and delete the rest.  The best apps for Londoners 12 show all The best apps for Londoners 1/12 Zip car ‘Join, reserve, unlock and drive’ — it really is that simple.

Free 4/12 Santander Cycles Launched this summer, the official app for Boris’ fifth child can be used to search for nearby docking stations and check bike availability. There’s also a journey planner featuring easy, moderate and fast routes to satisfy all cycling tribes. Free 5/12 Plume Air Report This new app has been downloaded by 3,000 Londoners. Sensors gathering air pollution data submit updates every hour, resulting in a scale that ranges from ‘fresh’ to ‘extremely polluted’. Free 6/12 Nightcapp Here’s an app that will have booze hounds raising their glasses. NightCapp is a map that pinpoints more than 1,500 London watering holes that stay open past 11.30pm. It also shows users when a bar is about to close by highlighting it in orange. Better get moving. Free 7/12 Money Dashboard An award-winning budget planner, this helps you keep track of personal spending across multiple accounts, pay off credit cards and even makes suggestions on how to manage your finances better. Free 8/12 Her Promising to introduce women to ‘a lesbian that hasn’t slept with any of your friends’, this revamped dating app includes queer-themed news and blogs, upcoming event notices and an improved algorithm-matching system. Free 9/12 FoodMood This new startup, which reckons it’s ‘Tinder for food’, pledges to narrow down your choice of lunchbreak destinations. Hit ‘yum’ or ‘yuk’ on photos of dishes in your area. Juvenile, but strangely addictive. Free 10/12 Daily Yoga This offers more than 50 yoga sessions, as well as a database of 500 yoga poses.

There’s even a beard-rating option for aficionados. Free 4. Delete your deleted photos Read more Pokémon Go player 'walked 140 miles and lost two stone while collecting characters' Sadiq Khan immortalised in new emoji keyboard for Londoners The best tech to take on holiday We’ve all been there - you need to free up some space on your phone, you trawl through hundreds of photos, you delete as many as you can bring yourself to.  Half an hour later, your phone is still prompting you to check your available storage.  This is because Apple like to store your deleted photos for 30 days as a ‘just in case’ feature. So, you’ll need to delete your deleted photos before you'll see any change in your available storage:.

I focused on the moment and story in front of me.” Fugen Xiao/www.ippawards.com 2/15 Siyuan Niu, Overall Winner “The brave and wise Khalkhas live along the mountains in the south of Xinjiang and are companions with the eagles. They regard eagles as their children and train them for many years to hunt. This 70 year old man is rigid and solemn in front of family and friends, but when he is with his beloved eagle, the corner of his mouth would curve up. When the eagles reach mating age, although he is very reluctant, the man releases the eagles back into nature so that they can thrive. A mild heart and exquisite love are covered by his weather-beaten face. He is a tough man with a tender heart.” Siyuan Niu/www.ippawards.com 3/15 Robin Robertis, 2nd place, Overall Winner “I was on a iPhone workshop and reunion with a friend and teacher in Cape Cod. We all went out to photograph the the perfect sunset. I tend to bring a few things when I travel, one being this wonderful red umbrella. When others shoot the sunsets and beautiful scenery, I like to photograph some human aspects in these scenes.” Robin Robertis/www.ippawards.com 4/15 Carolyn Mara Borlenghi, 3rd Place, Overall Winner “This image was taken as part of a series I did for Instagram’s #WHPwonderland. Each weekend when the hashtag project comes out I try to come up with an idea and this particular weekend, the weekend before Christmas, was wonderland. For this one I went on a little adventure with my son to the beach and we wore the reindeer masks.” Carolyn Mara Borlenghi/www.ippawards.com 5/15 Yuki Cheung Hong Kong, 1st Place, Lifestyle “I and a group of friends went to Iceland last year, the dream destination for every photographer. It was amazing and we enjoyed every moment.” Yuki Cheung/www.ippawards.com 6/15 Erica Wu, 1st Place, Animals “I started traveling around Japan 3 years ago and have visited all 47 prefectures to discover all kinds of animal spots, including cat islands, cat temples, zoos and farms. My photo was taken in the Miyagi zao fox village while I was feeding the foxes, it was a very a dramatic scene when they all stared at me at the same time so I took out my iPhone to capture the moment immediately.” Erica Wu/www.ippawards.com 7/15 V-J Rithwik, 3rd place, Lifestyle “This photo is taken from top of the light house in Chennai in India.” V-J Rithwik/www.ippawards.com 8/15 Jian Wang, 1st Place, Architecture “The photo “China Red” was taken in Beijing Olympic Park, in front of this traditional Chinese red wall. I was fascinated by the great visual effect which was created by the lights and shades.” Jian Wang/www.ippawards.com 9/15 K K Changsha, 1st Place, Children “The photo was shot in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province in China. Two children were playing with a home-made sled on the frozen Songhua River.” KK/www.ippawards.com 10/15 Jian Wang Beijing, 3rd Place, Landscape “I took this picture when I was about to walk back to hotel after a whole day’s shooting. The sun was going down and the sky was slowly fading into darkness. It was quite a unique landform.” Jian Wang/www.ippawards.com 11/15 Xia Zhenkai Guangdong, 1st Place, People “I was filming some empty lens reflex for my documentary on the riverbank of the Indian Ganges River, then happened to see this man who was bathing in the river and immediately use my mobile phone to take this moment.” Xia Zhenkai/www.ippawards.com 12/15 Paddy Chao, 3rd place, Portrait “This photo was taken in the evening at The Temple of Kom Ombo, Egypt. An Islamic street cleaner was taking a short break while falling into some deep thought. Time seemed stopped completely and irrelevant to him; I immediately took out my camera and captured this beautiful scene before it was gone.” Paddy Chao/www.ippawards.com 13/15 Yongmei Wang, 2nd place, Sunset “This picture was taken in Guilin in July 30th 2015. When I arrived in the village Xingping, I was deeply attracted by the natural scenery, the river, the mountain, the bamboo and the tranquility. I rented a bicycle and idled along the Li River the whole afternoon, talking with the local people and taking pictures. I stayed in Xingping for a few days and found out the right place and right time to see the sunset and sunrise with the help of some local people. It has proven that all the effort and waiting are worthwhile, I was lucky to have met one of the most beautiful sunrises in my life with the splendid clouds and the fisherman in Xingping.” Yongmei Wang/www.ippawards.com 14/15 Lone Bjørn Zurich, 1st Place, Flowers “I took this Photo on a warm day at the end of May 2015. On my way home from work I saw this field full of red back-lighted poppies, catching the last daylight. A perfect end to a good day.” Lone Bjørn/www.ippawards.com 15/15 Mette Lampcov, 2nd Place, Animals “Milly is happiness on four very short little legs, wagging her tail all day long, but as the day is long Milly thinks she is a ferocious hunter, regardless of her miniature size.” Mette Lampcov/www.ippawards.com 5. Check your e-mail attachments While your e-mails may not take up much room, the attachments will.

The CO2 tank powering its primary weapon ruptured, sending his droid skittering into the spikes lining the arena. Moments later, the bot’s nemesis, Tazbot, flipped it over and landed six blows with a pickaxe before judges called the fight. Vogt, who was 13, didn’t know it, but that Battlebots match in Las Vegas would be instrumental in determining his career path and, possibly, the future of transportation. As his father slogged along the highway stretching across the prairie toward their home in Kansas City, Vogt thought, “This seems like something a robot could do.” Cruise Automation CEO Kyle Vogt. Drew Kelly for WIRED Today, Vogt is 30 and the CEO of Cruise Automation, the self-driving car outfit General Motors bought for about $600 million in March. The San Francisco startup is the lynchpin of GM’s bid to build a network of autonomous cars. The Detroit giant got plenty of competition. Ford, Nissan, BMW, Volvo, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and others are working on autonomy, too. They’ve all got the manufacturing capability and scale needed here, and most have set up research centers in Silicon Valley to build up their software skills. Then there are the tech companies, who don’t have the factories but are sharper when it comes to code: China’s Baidu, Uber, Apple (maybe), and of course Google, whose 58 cars have driven nearly two million miles, and clock another 20,000 each week. GM’s improving its lineup by signing Cruise as a free agent, rather than waiting for the farm system to bubble up talent. That makes sense, says John Maddox, an auto industry veteran who’s now CEO of the newly formed American Mobility Center, a soon to be built autonomous vehicle testing center in Michigan. The automakers working on autonomy know they don’t have all the technical know-how in-house, he says. “They realize that because it is so new, they can all benefit in one way or another from fresh eyes.” New blood brings new capabilities. Vogt, who also co-founded Twitch, launched Cruise in 2013. He wanted to create a drop-in system for making luxury cars drive themselves on the highway, where wide roads and few variables like pedestrians make the task relatively simple. He did it, too. But less than a year after announcing a $10,000 retrofit kit for Audi’s A4 sedan, Cruise went silent. Vogt decided highway autonomy wasn’t enough. He wanted to challenge Google and everybody else in building cars that never need humans. Re-Routing The shift pushed Cruise in a new direction and provided a greater sense of purpose, but yielded a new question: How do they make it a business? The retrofit kit  offered a clear plan: “We would build this product, sell it to people,” Vogt says, had they brought it to market. How the company might make money with fully autonomous vehicles wasn’t so clear. GM isn’t entirely sure, either, but it thinks ridesharing might be an answer. The company knows the idea of one person, one car is giving way to services like Uber. That’s why it invested half a billion dollars in Lyft in January. The next step is ditching the fleshy driver. What motivates us is the chance to achieve massive social impact, and that takes lots and lots of vehicles. Cruise Automation CEO Kyle Vogt “The traditional rideshare business is sort of interesting, and autonomous vehicles are kind of interesting,” says GM President Dan Ammann. “It’s when you put the two together that things get really interesting.” Google gets all the attention when it comes to autonomous cars, but GM is no stranger to the technology. It joined Carnegie Mellon in building a robo-Chevy Tahoe for the Darpa Grand Challenge in 2007, and is developing a semi-autonomous system called Supercruise that will handle highway driving. But it trails in the race to create the software needed to navigate complex urban environments. It wants Cruise to close that gap. Tag Team Cruise’s office, in what was once a fabric store, is typical of San Francisco startups. About 100 engineers use large, shared tables as desks, some use standing desks. The day I visited, a caterer was preparing papusas for lunch; bananas and oranges were laid out for snacking. A pride flag hangs on one wall under the high, wooden ceiling. What looks like an American Gladiators jousting stick sits on a cabinet in the corner. Vogt likes to run his company like a startup, he says, and GM’s been mostly hands off. Still, there are hints of the automotive giant. There’s the GM-provided screen Vogt usually uses to video chat with Detroit colleagues, but today plays the YouTube clip of Decimator’s demise. And there are the dozen Chevrolet Bolts in the garage two floors below, some of the earliest pre-production units of the car GM created to beat Tesla to the mass market for electric vehicles. The Race to Automation Clever AI Turns a World of Lasers Into Maps for Self-Driving Cars Mercedes’s New E-Class Kinda Drives Itself—And It’s Kinda Confusing Tesla’s Autopilot Has Had Its First Deadly Crash Cruise rigged the Bolts with the requisite cameras, radars, and LIDaR sensors (mounted on twin stalks, as opposed to Google’s “KFC bucket” setup), and sends them out to traverse the city’s streets daily. The gear sits on top of the car, near the windshield, with wires running along the roof and down to the wheels. The company’s only accident thus far occurred in January, when a Cruise-powered Nissan Leaf (the ride of choice before the GM deal) moved left within its lane, then right, according to a DMV accident report. The human engineer took control, but still managed to hit a parked Toyota Prius at 20 mph—the company calls it human error. Vogt rides along a few times a week to keep track of progress, but he won’t say much about what his team has accomplished so far. And he’s reluctant to speak to the most pressing questions about the tech: the need for high-res 3D mapping, the ethics of autonomy, how to prove these cars are ready for the public. That’s understandable. Cruise has been at this problem for less than two years. Google was equally quiet at the start of its project, which is nearly a decade old. “We’re still very heads down,” Vogt says, but he’s confident. “Everything’s a matter of time and work.” But with GM on its side, Cruise knows it can stay in the marathon—and that once it’s ready to go to market, the automaker could prove a vital ally.”What motivates us is the chance to achieve massive social impact, and that takes lots and lots of vehicles,” Vogt says. “We’re very pleased so far with their progress,” Ammann says, both in building the system and collaborating with the mothership. He says Cruise’s  work will link with GM’s interest in ridesharing, but how that will work and when it might happen are TBD. As for the competition, Google, Ford, Nissan, and Mercedes are all aiming to get autonomous cars to the public by 2020. BMW says 2021, Baidu 2019. Vogt won’t reveal when he thinks his technology will be ready for GM’s mass-market touch, beyond saying he’ll be out of a job if he can’t do it within 10 to 15 years. In the meantime, he’ll settle for driving admiral blue Corvette he picked up with his employee discount.

I had work to do, but couldn’t remember if I’d saved the right Google Docs to work offline. I had a movie, but the last time I tested a Chromebook on a plane it couldn’t even play back 1080p. The biggest knock on Google’s Chrome OS always has been that it’s useless offline—it’s just a browser, after all, and what good is a browser without an Internet connection? Luckily, I’d been upgraded to first class (Gold Medallion FTW), so worst-case I’d stash the computer and pound bad wine for an hour. When I opened the Chromebook 13 and entered my password, the computer sprang to life. All my docs and files were there. Interstellar played beautifully on the gorgeous high-res screen. When I selected a Google Doc, it opened in a tab, and the only sign that I was offline was a small lightning bolt alongside the document’s name. Forty-five minutes later, I closed the lid and returned my tray table to its upright and locked position. I’d barely tapped the battery. The $499 Chromebook 13 is, in many ways, the Chromebook you’ve been waiting for. It falls between Google’s glorious, preposterously expensive Chromebook Pixel, and everyone else’s craptastic Chromebooks. Google and HP desperately want to prove Chromebooks can be more than cheap, student-friendly laptops. This is a Business Laptop, a Primary Device, a laptop to use as your only machine. They kind of pulled it off. The machine looks high-end: Brushed metal, monochrome logos, just one or two stupid stickers that take entirely too much effort to peel off the palmrest. It’s a half-inch thick and a bit less than three pounds, which isn’t small but doesn’t feel any bigger than a MacBook Air. The Chromebook 13 is understated and polished. It looks like an upper-middle-class Windows PC, which I suspect is exactly what HP was going for. It uses low-power versions of Intel’s latest Skylake chips, which are more than adequate for keeping up with the three dozen or so browser tabs I usually have going. (My review unit sports a Core M5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. At $819, it’s the most expensive model, and overkill. Get the cheapest one with the great screen.) Most of the processor’s effort goes toward powering the 13.3-inch screen, a gorgeous 3200×1800 panel that looks just a bit oversaturated but is as good as any laptop screen out there. It’s not a touchscreen, which you’ll hardly notice now but will almost certainly miss later. The speakers are fine, and the webcam isn’t a total horror show. The battery lasts eight to nine hours. The $499 Chromebook 13 is, in many ways, the Chromebook you’ve been waiting for. Switching to the Chromebook 13 might be easier than getting used to, say, Apple’s new MacBook. For one thing, it has ports, plural: two USB-C and one USB 3, along with a microSD slot. You can charge your computer and connect a hard drive at the same time. What a world! The keyboard, too, is so much deeper and more tactile that you’ll figure it out long before your adapt to the MacBook’s membrane mashers. The keys do bottom out harshly when you whack ’em hard, but at least you’re hitting the right keys. The trackpad is the only truly bad thing about the Chromebook 13. It’s often so rough and jumpy that I end up clicking daintily, making a face I’d probably make if I ever had to defuse a bomb, hoping I don’t accidentally delete something while trying to click “Bold.” When I do click, the trackpad crunches, like there’s a Cheerio under there. Still, the Chromebook 13 is more than enough laptop for most people, at a price most people can stomach. Chrome OS is the same deal: If you don’t think you can do everything in a browser, well, you’re probably wrong. You probably do everything in a browser already, unless your life requires Photoshop or Premiere or some other $800 software. (In that case, you could buy an iPad and a Chromebook 13 and still save money, but I digress.) I absolutely could switch to a Chromebook. I spent more than a week using this one for work, for Netflix, for everything. It could do anything I needed. What I missed, coming from the Macs I’ve used for a decade, was the fiddly stuff—the keyboard shortcuts, the crazy file system, the superpowered multitasking and window management. I hated not being able to type “ship” and have it populate my shipping address. Most of all, I missed having 1Password, but then 1Password launched a web app! Big day. Yes, switching to a Chromebook takes work, and Chrome OS feels less powerful than macOS or Windows. But almost nobody cares. Yes, switching to a Chromebook takes work, and Chrome OS feels less powerful than macOS or Windows. But almost nobody cares. Most people don’t use Alfred or Atext, or go to great lengths to master Evernote’s global keyboard shortcuts. They just want a good computer at a good price. The HP Chromebook 13 is exactly that. There are cheaper Chromebooks (the Asus Chromebook Flip is a good one), but they’re ugly and compromised. There’s a cooler Chromebook with a better trackpad, but it’s much more expensive. HP threw this one right down the middle and nailed it. If you’re looking for a new computer and have $500 to spend, this is the one to buy. For now, anyway. This is where things get sort of weird. Right now, you don’t really need a touchscreen on a Chromebook. But this fall, when Chrome OS and Android begin their conscious coupling and the Google Play store comes to Chrome OS, you’ll have literally millions of reasons to want one. (HP says the next Chromebook 13 will have one.) Over the next few months, Android apps will force Chromebook makers to reconsider absolutely everything about their devices. We’ll see new form factors, new sensors, new ideas about what a laptop even is when a laptop can run smartphone apps. If you can wait to buy a Chromebook, sit tight. If you can’t, buy this one.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents FTC sues 1-800 Contacts for attacking competitors’ search ads 1-800 Contacts demanded search-engine silence from 14 competitors. by Joe Mullin - Aug 11, 2016 11:00 am UTC Login to bookmark 37 Library of Congress The Federal Trade Commission has sued online retailer 1-800 Contacts, saying the company illegally restrained competitors from buying search advertisements. It's a dramatic move that could mold the shape of online trademark law for years to come. In the administrative complaint (PDF) filed Monday, FTC lawyers say that 1-800 Contacts reached deals with at least 14 competing contact lens sellers, in which they agreed to limit their advertising on search engines like Google and Bing. In the FTC's view, those agreements constituted unfair competition, because they limited truthful advertising and restrained price competition. The 14 competitors aren't named in the FTC's lawsuit, but some of them are likely to be companies that Utah-based 1-800 Contacts sued in court. In 2008, 1-800 Contacts filed a lawsuit (PDF) against LensFast.com, saying their keyword advertising violated trademark law; in 2010, ContactLensKing.com got sued (PDF) on similar grounds. The FTC complaint is scheduled to be heard by an FTC administrative law judge in April 2017. In a statement, 1-800 Contacts General Counsel Cindy Williams said her company "strongly disagrees" that its settlement agreements are anticompetitive. "Our settlement agreements were specifically designed to protect our intellectual property rights," she said. "1-800 Contacts strongly believes in a competitive contact lens marketplace and will continue to be a leading advocate for providing consumers with more choice, greater convenience, and lower prices." Contentious Marks The role of trademark law in online search advertising has been contentious since the very inception of online search, although the matter has settled out somewhat in recent years. To understand the importance of the FTC's claims, it's worth reviewing a very brief history of the issue. Search engines like Google and Bing make money from selling ads that are keyed to search terms. Some trademark owners have long disliked the fact that when a potential customer types in their trademark company name into Google—say, "American Airlines" or "Rosetta Stone"—the user will see ads from competitors. Some companies, including both companies cited above, chose to sue search engines, saying that selling such ads without their permission constitutes trademark infringement. Google fought those cases hard, and no trademark owner has ever convinced a court that selling trademarked keywords violates the law. Not only did Google not back down, it expanded the practice to Europe after winning a court case against luxury brand owners including France's Louis Vuitton. While lawsuits against search engines wound down to nothing, some trademark owners were persistent about suing competitors who purchased ads keyed to their trademarks. However, those types of cases also mostly went in the advertiser's favor. In the past several years, US court cases in which an advertiser buys a trademarked keyword but does not use the trademark in the text of the ad have universally been resolved in favor of the advertiser, according to Prof. Eric Goldman of Santa Clara University, who has tracked and blogged about such cases for years. A third type of keyword-ad litigation involves advertisers that buy a competitor's trademark and also use that trademark in the ad copy. Those can't be easily generalized about, because the outcome is dependent on factors beyond just buying online ads. However, even in those more aggressive examples, many of the cases are resolving in favor of the advertiser, Goldman notes. Back in 2004, 1-800 Contacts began sending cease and desist letters to competing online stores, telling them that the mere appearance of their ad in response to a search query that contained "1-800 Contacts" constituted trademark infringement. "1-800 Contacts threatened to sue its rivals that did not agree to cease participating in these search advertising auctions," write FTC lawyers in the complaint. "Most often, rivals quickly acceded to 1-800 Contacts' demands in order to avoid prolonged and costly litigation." Only one competitor, Lens.com, litigated against 1-800 Contacts for the long haul. That case ultimately went up to the US Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which rejected 1-800 Contacts' trademark claims. Between 2004 and 2013, at least 14 competing stores stopped bidding for ads. That left 1-800 Contacts, already the titan of the industry with more than 50 percent market share, free to bid on its own trademark with little or no competition. Long battle ahead For those who believe, as Goldman does, that competitive keyword advertising is beneficial and pro-consumer, the FTC case is potentially a big win that could create lasting change by getting a crystal-clear endorsement of keyword advertising. A legal opinion from a judge who favors the government's view will hold more weight going forward than one favoring an embittered competitor. But, Goldman warns, don't start the party quite yet. First of all, a complaint is just a complaint. "It hasn't been battle-tested," said Goldman. "No court has agreed with it, and it's possible no court will ever agree." The FTC's complaint goes ahead and assumes that competitive keyword advertising is not only okay, but indisputably legal. They're saying that the "no bidding" agreements distorted the marketplace. But if buying such ads is actually trademark infringement and can confuse consumers—as some large trademark owners continue to believe—then all 1-800 Contacts was doing was making sure the market worked correctly. "It's not really being distorted if the people bidding are infringing trademarks," said Goldman in an interview with Ars. "You have to not only believe that competitive keyword advertising is legitimate, but believe it's not even in doubt." And of course, the FTC case could utterly backfire and make the landscape more murky than it is now. But the way FTC cases work, that's not likely, at least in the near term. The administrative law judge who will hear the complaint is essentially an FTC employee; a party who loses a case to the Federal Trade Commission can appeal, but the appeal then gets heard by the full Federal Trade Commission. Only after that can a party appeal to a "regular" federal appeals court with a non-FTC judge. That's right—for two long rounds of legal battles, the FTC will get to be both prosecutor and judge. That's why some private practice lawyers have ridiculed the FTC as a kind of "kangaroo court." For 19 years, from 1995 to 2014, the agency did not lose a single administrative lawsuit with unfair competition claims. That's why one of the big questions going forward is how hard 1-800 Contacts is going to fight this case. The company is years away, millions of dollars away, from having its fate heard by an independent judge. For those looking for a deep dive into the subject, Goldman, a longtime critic of 1-800 Contacts, ponders some other questions in a lengthy blog post published yesterday. That includes the complex issue of what kind of "vertical" restrictions on keyword ads can be legally put in place for affiliates and franchisees.

It’s a suggestion that’s caught fire – a five-month-old online petition demanding Palestine be labeled and bordered in Google Maps has gained more than 250,000 signatures just over the past few days. The issue is far more nuanced than the instantaneous outrage about Google “wiping Palestine from the map” would suggest. Google has never actually labeled the country, which isn’t officially recognised by the US or much of the west. The swiftness of the backlash, though, is not just about the wish for justice on behalf of an occupied people, but about the belief – now punctured – that our technology is neutral, that it presents an unbiased, infallible version of the world. Prior to the sailing expeditions that began with the Renaissance, humanity had no map of the world. In 1891 a German geographer called Albrecht Penck proposed and set out to lead an International World Map project, by which all maps would be designed based on a single international standard. According to Jerry Brotton’s book A History of the World in Twelve Maps, Penck bemoaned a lack of consistency among scales and even styles of extant maps, and dreamed of collaborating with the cartographic agencies of the world to create a great atlas of 2,500 maps, all where one inch would equal 15.78 miles, or one centimetre per kilometre. Penck’s standardised world atlas would never be finished. Although the UNplanned to carry it on in the 20th century, commitment waned during world war two. Despite the sunk cost, relatively significant in its time, only a few hundred maps were created. Still, it remains the closest humanity has ever come to a global mapmaking standard. Despite the common notion of maps as universal and inarguable, they remain a riot of inconsistent measures, evolving coastlines, and constantly shifting ideas about nations and their sovereignty. Not even Google can do what Penck could not: create a vision of the globe that is true for all who see it. But in fact it has tried – one thing many of us are learning for the first time off the back of the Palestine controversy is that Google Maps sometimes shows disputed borders differently depending on where the user is searching from. An ongoing project called Disputed Territories has documented this: for example, it reports, America and much of the west views Crimea in the Ukraine as a site of Russian occupation, and it appears on the map as such. However, to map users in Russia, the boundary is solid, an official annexation. While it might seem imperialistic for Google to decide how the US should see the rest of the world, perhaps it would be equally troubling to see the company wade into global verdicts on the righteousness of every international occupation. That it allows its sketch of the geopolitical climate to reflect the perspective of who is viewing it, rather than impose the prevailing popular opinion in the west, may not be neutral or unbiased, but it is probably the most fair. Where we wade into difficulty is the lack of transparency that average users have about how these services work. We frequently assume technology has no preference, but it often does, even something such as hiring by algorithm doesn’t necessarily remove human discrimination, as many believe. During high school, our history and social studies teachers had us bring in multiple newspaper clippings of the same news story from both liberal and conservative outlets, and taught us to identify bias in headlines, word choices and chosen angles. It was impressed on us how important it was we know that “the news” was not a single trustworthy monolith, and that we should learn to compare different sources and perspectives as critical readers in order to understand the world. We need similar education – for adults as well as young people on the opacity and capriciousness of privately owned technology platforms, and how the things we assume to be standardised utilities are hugely influenced by biases in the data used to build them. Until researching this article I didn’t know that there had never been a single, standardised world map project but of course it makes sense that the project fell apart during the second world war. And many people don’t know that there is more than one standard Google Maps (or Apple Maps, which doesn’t show Palestine either, or Microsoft’s Bing Maps, which does) depending on where in the world you are. Or that there are different search results for different people, and that those search results can be biased, even discriminatory. Our many digital maps must account for multiple views of the world – but their existence also must inform us that ours is only one among them. An expanded mapping utility that encouraged users to view the world from many different perspectives, complete with current facts, could be a marvellous educational tool. But no matter what, we need far more transparency from tech companies about the way biases affect what we see when we use their services - and about how the reliable neutrality of a trusted machine is as impossible as Penck’s dream of an international world map.

Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides Get Updates on Android and iOS The updates have already started rolling out Aug 11, 2016 11:00 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has just pushed out a new update to the iOS versions of some of its most popular applications, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slide. The update allows users to multitask more easily on their iPads and brings the Docs and Slides apps to versions 1.2016.30204. The new feature provides the tools for using any of Google's productivity applications side by side with another application so that users can chat and edit a document at the same time. This can prove quite useful when working on a document for work and getting indications from co-workers. The update also comes with some general bug fixes and improvements to the Slides and Sheets apps, as well as with the option to insert images and use page breaks for the Docs app. The new features would work on the iPad Air 2, mini 4 and even Pro. In addition, Android versions of the three applications have also been updated. Google has updated Docs, Slides and Sheets for Android with some new features regarding tables and charts, according to Android Police. Now, users will be able to copy cells from the sheets app and paste them into either Docs or Slides so that a fully formatted table would be produced. The feature won't work with tables that have more than 400 cells. The updates are set to roll out in the following days, and they might take some time before they reach all end users. #Google#Google Docs#Google Sheets#Google Slides#Android reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Keep Gets Intelligent Organization Feature, Inbox Receives Direct Sharing Google Docs for Android Updated with Research Tool, Voice Typing, More Google Updates Drive for Android with Ability to Download Multiple Files, More Google Adds Branding Logo to Its Apps to Better Counter Microsoft's Assault iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Google updated Docs, Sheets and Slides New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Here Is How Nokia Will Release Android Smartphones in 2017 more on: Nokia smartphones i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

That could benefit Microsoft's search engine. Sam Mattera (TMFMattera) Aug 11, 2016 at 6:22AM Image source: Apple. Later this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release macOS Sierra, the next version of its Mac operating system. Sierra will bring a number of notable improvements to Apple's PCs, including support for Apple Pay and deeper integration with iOS devices. It also brings Siri, Apple's digital personal assistant. Siri made her debut back in 2011, but it's taken Apple a full five years to bring her to the Mac. Nevertheless, her introduction could dramatically improve the productivity of Mac users, and give them a new way to interact with their machines. It could also pose a threat to Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Siri comes to the desktop Once they've installed Sierra, Mac users will be able to call on Siri by speaking to their machines. It's a bit of a shift from the familiar mouse and keyboard, but impressions have been generally favorable. Wired's David Pierce described the process of using Siri on the Mac as "almost natural" and "definitely useful." Ultimately, he concluded that Siri may be better on the Mac than she is on the iPhone. In addition to her standard functionality, Mac Siri can conduct special Mac-related tasks, like searching local files or changing settings. iPhone users often find Siri most useful when they aren't actually using their phones at all -- Apple has trumpeted Siri's hands-free features as a key selling point in recent years. But on the Mac, she offers the prospect of improved multi-tasking. A Mac owner can use Siri to change a setting, play a song, or find a file without leaving their current application. The inclusion of Siri probably won't help Apple sell that many more Macs, as competing machines running Windows 10 have something similar. Still, it does enhance Apple's offerings and ensures that the company is keeping pace with its rivals. Cortana has helped Bing capture share Perhaps more interesting is what Siri could do to the search market. Beyond finding files and changing settings, Siri can be used to scour the web. Since 2013, she's relied on Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing to do so. Unless you specifically request Google, simple commands such as "find me chicken recipes" will result in Siri conducting a Bing search. Last December, research firm Kantar found that Siri relied on Bing frequently. Analyzing the behavior of 3,000 different Siri users, Kantar found that Bing powered 63% of the searches Siri conducted. Microsoft's share of the U.S. search market has been rising in recent quarters. In July, 2015, Bing captured 20.4% of the U.S. desktop search market, according to comScore. Google's share was more than three times higher, at 64%. But over the last year, the gap has closed a bit. In June, comScore reported Bing's market share at 21.8%. Meanwhile, Google stood at 63.8%. That shift has been driven by Windows 10 -- last quarter, over 40% of Microsoft's search revenue came from Windows 10 devices. Like macOS Sierra, Windows 10 includes a digital personal assistant: Cortana, which, unsurprisingly, is also powered by Bing. Cortana is integrated directly into the Windows 10 taskbar, and on many PCs can be summoned with a quick voice command. To date, Windows 10 users have asked Cortana more than 8 billion questions, and 100 million Windows 10 users rely on her each month. Siri's addition to the Mac could have a similar effect. There are fewer Mac users than Windows users, obviously, but Siri could shift some search queries to Bing in the months ahead. If Bing's share of the search market continues to rise, Microsoft may have Apple to thank. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

By Liam Tung | August 11, 2016 -- 10:52 GMT (03:52 PDT) | Topic: Networking Blue dots indicate where Google wants to test 3.5GHz wireless tech. Image: Google Google is urgently preparing a new round of secretive tests of wireless broadband delivery in the US, where it's angling to sidestep incumbent telecom operators. In a new filing with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Google has sought a special license to test wireless broadband technologies in the 3.5GHz band across 24 US locations for two years. Special Feature Next Generation Networks The rising tides of big data, video, and cloud computing are driving tremendous demand for faster and more efficient networks. We delve into how things like software-defined networks (SDN) and new wireless technologies are enabling business transformation. Read More Google said the experiments would support the development of technologies for the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which operates in that band and will be used as a test bed for spectrum sharing. Execs from Google Access, the unit responsible for Google Fiber, have been exploring fixed wireless broadband for low-density areas where costs prohibit laying fiber. Google has requested the authorization be "granted expeditiously" for tests between 3.4GHz and 3.8GHz, the space that has been made available for small-cell spectrum sharing by CBRS devices. It notes that existing licenses for ongoing tests in this band at several locations are set to expire in December. The 24 locations in the new application are spread across cities in California, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia. Google plans to test base stations as well as end-user devices with approved staff and contractors. Google also intends to use the test to improve its Spectrum Access System (SAS) database, which may eventually be used to manage spectrum sharing in the 3.5GHz band. Google had previously developed the SAS database for TV white-space spectrum sharing. News of the application followed a report from the San Jose Mercury News that Google's Fiber rollout has been delayed in some cities, including San Jose where a plan to lay fiber was abruptly brought to halt last month. With its recent acquisition of the small ISP Webpass, Google does have another option now to roll-out high-speed broadband without necessarily digging up streetscapes to lay fiber cable. The Webpass technology is suited to high-density areas with an abundance of apartment blocks, whereas small cell networks in the 3.5GHz range could also be used to provide fixed wireless broadband in rural areas.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Google's got you covered for Android QuadRooter protection By Mark Wilson Shares The discovery of QuadRooter is one of the biggest security threats to Android users since Stagefright. Security firm Check Point Software has released a tool to help people determine if their phones are at risk, but Google says that it is already able to block apps with the QuadRooter exploit. The Verify Apps feature of Google Play Services is able to detect and block any apps that feature QuadRooter. As the exploit has to be delivered via an app, this effectively protects the vast majority of handsets that are threatened. QuadRooter is actually a series of four individual vulnerabilities, and Google currently offers protection against three of them. An update will roll out shortly that shores up defenses even further, but of course this is dependent on individual handsets being eligible for security updates. In a statement to Android Central, Google said: "We appreciate Check Point's research as it helps improve the safety of the broader mobile ecosystem. Android devices with our most recent security patch level are already protected against three of these four vulnerabilities. The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2016-5340, will be addressed in an upcoming Android security bulletin, though Android partners can take action sooner by referencing the public patch Qualcomm has provided. "Exploitation of these issues depends on users also downloading and installing a malicious application. Our Verify Apps and SafetyNet protections help identify, block, and remove applications that exploit vulnerabilities like these."

By Liam Tung | August 11, 2016 -- 10:19 GMT (03:19 PDT) | Topic: Security Google is rolling out profile alerts for email that hasn't been authenticated. Image: Google Google is enabling new security warnings in Gmail to combat phishing and other threats posed by spoofed email accounts and malicious links. More security news Catastrophic botnet to smash social media networks in 2017 DoD, HackerOne kick off Hack the Army bug bounty challenge ATM hacks in 'more than a dozen' European countries in 2016: Group IB Windows 10 tip: Keep your Microsoft account secure with 2-factor authentication The new warnings should go some way to countering email-spoofing tactics that are frequently used in phishing and the multi-billion dollar scam known as business email compromise (BEC). Over the next few days, Gmail on the web and on Android devices will display a question mark next to a sender's profile pic, corporate logo, or avatar if the message can't be authenticated. The checks are done against Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records or the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) standard, which allows the sender to sign legitimate email digitally. Gmail users can currently check whether an email is authenticated by opening the email and clicking the down arrow next to the sender's name. If it is authenticated, the message will display a 'signed-by' header with the sending domain, and a 'mailed-by' head with the domain name. The new warnings make these details more obvious to end users. The new avatar warnings follow Google's decision last year to adopt the DMARC protocol, which is short for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance, also to combat phishing. DMARC allows domain owners to tell Gmail how to handle unauthenticated messages from that domain. However, to put this measure in place, domain owners first needed to configure SPF and DKIM on all outbound email. The end-user warnings rolling out on Gmail may apply more pressure on domain owners to authenticate outbound email. Google notes that not all emails that display the warnings will necessarily be dangerous, but warns users to take extra caution when opening them. The other security warning is rolling out only to Gmail on the web and is an extension of Google's Safe Browsing technology, which is used by Chrome, Safari, and Firefox to alert users to potentially malicious web pages. Now, if a message in Gmail contains a link to a site that's known by Safe Browsing as bad, users will see a full-page security alert, warning them not to proceed.

Her story takes in the arguments of Clive Sheldon, acting on behalf of the NEC and Labour general secretary Ian McNicol. She writes: Labour’s national executive committee must have the power to determine who is eligible to vote in a leadership election, depending on the circumstances surrounding the poll, the court of appeal has heard. The party is appealing against a high court ruling that the NEC was wrong to block 130,000 new members from voting in the leadership election by imposing a retrospective six-month freeze. Clive Sheldon QC, acting for the party’s general secretary, Iain McNicol, told Lord Justice Beatson, Lady Justice Macur and Lord Justice Sales that the party’s rulebook gave the NEC the power to define the eligibility criteria. The NEC was “the guardian of the constitution”, he said. “What we have done is consistent with the rules framework, but even if it were not, the NEC still has the power to go against the rules framework.” There was “nothing in the [party] rulebook which says a freeze date cannot be retrospective,” he went on. “That is entirely an operational matter which must be left to the NEC to determine because it knows the state of the party.” NEC is guardian of Labour constitution, appeal court told Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.23am EDT 09:23 Questions are already being asked about how Unison went about its consultation, with some pointing out that the 20,190 members who took part in the union’s online consultation constituting just a tiny fraction of its 1.3 million membership. *Gez Sagar* (@brilliantname) @damiengayle Would love to know how @unisontweets consulted members. Only ~20,000 took part out of 1.3 milion https://t.co/O2e4VBvMfl August 11, 2016 The questions asked were: Would you like the Labour Link committee to nominate a candidate in the forthcoming Labour Leadership election? And: If the Unison Labour Link committee decides to nominate a candidate, do you have a preference on which candidate they should nominate? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.18am EDT 09:18 Unison general secretary Dave Prentis has said that the views of those members who backed Owen Smith “will always be respected in our union”, obliquely addressing the constant accusations of bullying and so-called “uncomradely” behaviour that have dogged the campaign - and indeed the Labour party since Corbyn won the leadership last year. In his statement, Prentis warned that Labour risked winning from the Tories the unwelcome sobriquet of the “nasty party” if such behaviour continued: Jeremy Corbyn retains the backing of a majority of Unison’s Labour-supporting members. That’s why the committee supported his nomination again. However, a significant minority backed Owen Smith. Their views will always be respected in our union - that’s our proud tradition. It’s healthy for people to hold alternative views on the future direction of the party. What’s toxic though is for abuse, threats and aggressive language to be considered acceptable, or the norm. Labour is in danger of becoming the new ‘nasty party’ if this behaviour continues unchecked. There’s no place in the party for witch hunts against MPs, councillors and party staff. The decent, hard-working people we represent don’t want a party riven by in-fighting. They want a united opposition that stands up for public services which are facing intolerable pressures. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.08am EDT 09:08 Unison backs Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader News just in: Unison has given its supporting nomination for the Labour leadership to Jeremy Corbyn, according to the Labour leader’s campaign. Britain’s second-largest trade union, with 1.3 million members, says its membership voted 58% to 42% in favour of Corbyn over the challenger, Owen Smith. Particularly relevant in light of Jess Phillips’s comments today, the union notes that women are in the majority among its membership. In response to the news, Corbyn said: I am proud to have the support of Unison members. Their incredible work, against the backdrop of cuts, privatisation and outsourcing of public services, keeps the services we all rely on running - from the NHS to local government. We need a Labour Party that gives them a voice - that halts and reverses the cuts, privatisation, and outsourcing that are ripping Britain’s communities and services apart. The next Labour government will create a million new jobs and build a million new homes - and we will end the public sector pay cap overnight. In the NHS and across the public sector, we will push back against outsourcing and privatisation, and invest properly in staff and infrastructure. Our plan to rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and nowhere is left behind will restore dignity, jobs and quality to our public services. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.01am EDT 09:01 The court of appeal is just about to get going again after its lunchtime recess. In the meantime, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP, who has been vocal about her opposition to Corbyn and what she believes is male-domination in the Labour party, has written for the Guardian about the lack of female candidates for forthcoming mayoral elections. Phillips accuses Corbyn of placing more importance on securing jobs for his “brothers in arms” than advancing the cause of women and says he failed to respond to her attempts to discuss the issue with him. She says: People tell me I should just get behind Jeremy, work with him. On this, I tried. I would have gladly organised events in the regions for women members and councillors. I would have gone with Jeremy, stood shoulder to shoulder on platforms, encouraged women to give it a go, and offered tips and mentoring about being a representative and standing for selection. I was willing to work hard to do something that would have made Jeremy look good. I’m left disappointed and deflated again. I don’t know why Jeremy didn’t answer. I don’t know why his office ignored my advances. They never ignored me before and haven’t since. He told me he was a feminist. I suppose feminism is out of the window when your brothers in arms want the jobs. The Labour party is becoming a movement of words not deeds. There are no female Labour mayoral candidates.

The '100 Richest Tech Billionaires In The World 2016' list is topped by Microsoft founder Bill Gates (bottom) with an estimated fortune of $78 billion. Premji ranks 13th on the list with a networth of $16 billion and Nadar comes in at the 17th spot with $11.6 billion of net worth. Two Indian-American technology czars Symphony Technology Group CEO Romesh Wadhwani (bottom) and founders of IT consulting and outsourcing company Syntel Bharat Desai and his wife Neerja Sethi are also on the list. Forbes said Premji, who heads India's third-largest outsourcer Wipro, has been on a buying spree in the past year to boost growth. Premji's son Rishad, who heads strategy and sits on the board, also oversees Wipro's $100 million venture capital fund. Nadar co-founded HCL, which is reportedly mulling a US listing, Forbes said adding that Nadar also owns HCL TalentCare, a skills-development firm that provides training to new graduates. His latest venture is a $500 million fund to invest in startups and US healthcare tech firms. Wadhwani is at 67th position with $3 billion net worth. A recipient of the 2013 Forbes India Non-Resident Philanthropist Award, Wadhwani announced in 2015 that he plans to commit up to $1 billion to fund entrepreneurship initiatives in India. Forbes said despite a tumultuous year for the stock market, "it was a good time to be a tech billionaire". The titans on Forbes' second annual list of the world's richest in technology are worth a combined $892 billion, six per cent more than a year ago. Just over half of the 100 richest in tech are from the US, including eight of the top 10 richest on the list. China has the second highest number of tech tycoons, with 19 people worth a combined $132.7 billion. The richest Chinese member is Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who is on the 8th spot and has an estimated net worth of $25.8 billion. Canada has five tech billionaires and Germany has four. Forbes said the second richest person in tech Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos (bottom) is also the biggest gainer on the list this year and has an estimated $66.2 billion fortune, an increase of $18.4 billion since this list was released last year. That puts him ahead of Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, who comes in on the 4th spot. Ellison was also beaten by Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (bottom), who climbed from fourth to third place thanks to a 30 per cent jump in the value of Facebook's stock; he is now also California's richest person, another title that previously belonged to Ellison. Only five women rank among the world's 100 richest in tech, including Zhou Qunfei on the 33rd spot. She became a billionaire in 2015 after Lens Technology's IPO, and has a net worth of $6.4 billion. America's richest self-made woman in tech is health care software firm Epic Systems founder and CEO Judy Faulkner (bottom), who has a net worth of $2.7 billion and is ranked 79th. The only other American woman on the list is Hewlett-Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, who has a net worth of $2.2 billion. She ranks 93rd. These 100 billionaires have an average age of 53, a decade younger than the average age of the entire 2016 Forbes Billionaires List.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Security Google’s Verify Apps feature protects 90% of Android devices against QuadRooter Security Google’s Verify Apps feature protects 90% of Android devices against QuadRooter By Bindu Nair - QuadRooter, the name given to a set of 4 vulnerabilities in Qualcomm-based Android devices, has been spooking the world with claims that over 90% of Android products are vulnerable to being attacked thanks to the flaw. The panic has reached such heights now that Google itself has stepped into the fray to assure people that their phones are safe. To recap, security firm Check Point first highlighted QuadRooter in a report earlier this week. According to the company, these 4 vulnerabilities can be manipulated by hackers via a malicious app which could gain root access and remotely control a person’s handset. Google has now issued a statement regarding the QuadRooter scare, telling Android Central that its most recent security patch protects against 3 out of 4 of these flaws. The last one, dubbed CVE-2016-5340, is set to be beamed out in an upcoming Android security bulletin. Also Read: Android encryption flaw puts millions of Qualcomm-powered devices at risk Handset makers don’t even have to wait for Google to send out the fix, since they can reference the public patch Qualcomm has supplied. The search behemoth also pointed out that attackers can only exploit QuadRooter if people download and install a dangerous app from shady sources. Furthermore, Google’s own Verify Apps and SafetyNet protections specifically identify, block and eliminate applications which take advantage of vulnerabilities like QuadRooter. The former is notably switched on by default for devices running Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and up, which translates to almost 90% of active Android gadgets. Verify Apps basically makes sure that even if a user does download a malicious app designed to exploit QuadRooter, the tool would display an ‘Installation has been blocked’ message with no option to dismiss the alert and force install it. The feature has been around for 4 years now, so the chances of an application slipping through the cracks are slim.

Both the smartphones bought a lot of praise for the search engine giant as the Nexus 6P was the best Android smartphone till the release of OnePlus 2 and the Galaxy S7. And, this year, Google might be following the same trend of releasing two new smartphones under the Nexus lineup. As of now, the smartphones are dubbed as the Nexus Sailfish (S1) and the Nexus Marlin (M1). The Nexus Sailfish will be the successor to the affordable Nexus 5X, whereas the Nexus Marlin will be the successor to the premium Nexus 6P. Both the smartphones will come with high-end hardware and the latest Android 7.0 Nougat software. SEE ALSO: Pokemon Go Gets Updated: Here are 6 New Features You Can Play With Having said that, the Nexus Sailfish is in the news for a quite some time now and there are benchmark leaks for the smartphone from the popular AnTuTu and GFXBench. Check out the sliders below to know what Nexus Sailfish will be powered with as per the leaked reports. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! The same 5.2-inch screen? The Nexus 5X arrived with a 5.2-inch FHD display which was pretty decent and the Nexus Sailfish also might arrive with a 5.2-inch 1080p screen as per the earlier GFXBench report. Powered with Snapdragon 820 Snapdragon 820 was the flagship chipset for the chipmaker. And, all the benchmark reports confirm that the smartphone will be powered by the Snapdragon 820 chipset and the GeekBench reports that it will be a quad-core chip with all the cores clocked at 1.59GHz. 4GB of RAM and 32GB of Internal storage Google might ditch the 16GB base model for the Nexus Sailfish as the company didn't achieve much success with the 16GB Nexus 5X. So,we might see the Sailfish arrive with 32GB of onboard storage along with 4GB of RAM. 13MP Primary Camera and 8MP Selfie Camera The camera resolution might be the same, however, Google might be updating the camera sensor. The smartphone is touted to come with a 13MP rear camera along with an 8MP front facing shooter. Android 7.0 Nougat This is an expected feature. The Nexus Sailfish will surely come with the latest Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box as the company always releases a new smartphone along with new iteration of Android. According to the AnTuTu leak, the smartphone is running Android NMR1 which is known as the 'Android Nougat Manufacturer Release 1'. HTC-the Manufacturer There is a lot of hype going around the world regarding this. But, all the leaked rumors till date suggested that HTC will be manufacturing the two Nexus smartphones for the year 2016. It is worth noticing that the first Nexus smartphone was manufactured by HTC back in 2010 and they also have Nexus 9 under their Nexus product portfolio. Release date and pricing The much-anticipated question is the release date and pricing.

The company unveiled its Daydream VR project at this year's I/O developer conference, revealing a new software platform alongside specs for a VR headset, and guidance notes for third-party manufacturers to create 'Daydream ready' handsets. And while it has since emerged that Google is working on its own version of a Daydream VR headset, it seems that's not all the firm has been up to. A new post on the Google Developers blog details how Daydream Labs has been testing ways to prevent trolling in virtual reality environments. Related: What is VR? Posted by Robbie Tilton, UX Designer at Google VR, the post states: "As developers and designers, we are excited to build social experiences that are fun and easy to use—but it’s just as important to make it safe and comfortable for all involved." So, what exactly is Google doing to ensure the virtual world is adequately protected against trolling? Firstly, Tilton explains how a virtual shopping experience built by the company resulted in users attempting to block other user's vision by placing hats over their line of sight. Pretty amusing stuff, but Google's having none of it. Tilton writes: "Everyone should feel safe and comfortable in VR. If we can anticipate the actions of others, then we may be able to discourage negative social behavior before it starts." Related: Best VR headset The team, eager to live up to this philosophy of a 'safe and comfortable' VR, built a virtual poker game where, if players left their seat at the table, their environment turned black and white and their avatar would disappear from the other player’s view. What's more, a glowing blue personal space bubble would appear around the seat itself, to encourage the player to return to the table. The idea is to stop players stealing chips or otherwise interefering with other players – which, while undoubtedly well intentioned, all seems a bit too much like spoiling the fun. Still, the company is intent upon promoting positivity, with Tilton explaining how 'people loved' a fireworks animation which appears when two players high-five, but that punching someone yielded no virtual reaction of any sort.

By Shira Ovide. Added by Agency Staff on 11 August 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Facebook, Google, Mark Zuckerberg Tweet Mark Zuckerberg Facebook collects less than the 5% of the US$500bn spent on advertising each year. To achieve the deepest, darkest dreams of Mark Zuckerberg, the company must become the first one that dominates both the kind of precision ads that built Google and the emotional ads that made TV the world’s dominant marketing force. Facebook has so far cracked the first half of that equation, following in the footsteps of Google by locking down what’s called “direct response” advertising. If I own a store in Brooklyn that sells running shoes, I naturally want to find people who are in the market for what I’m selling. If someone types “running shoes Brooklyn” into Google, the company has a pretty good clue that is a person I want. My store can pay to show a link to my website to this probable Brooklyn runner. Largely because Google became an efficient way for many businesses to find people who are looking for exactly what the businesses are selling, direct response ads make up the majority of online advertising. Facebook is pretty good at this type of advertising, too, again because we tell Facebook who we are and what we like. But dominating direct response ads with Google isn’t enough for Facebook. About $200bn is spent each year on TV commercials, mostly on direct response’s handsome brother, branded advertising. Brand ads are those TV commercials of a smiling couple driving an Audi through a snowy mountain range. The next time we go car shopping, Audi wants us to have this innate feeling that its vehicles will make us happy and beautiful. Away from the Internet, brand ads make up a majority of advertising. And they’re lucrative. The average cost to reach a thousand people with a prime-time TV ad was $50 in 2015, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. The comparable ad price on Facebook was $5. Facebook wants these pricey brand ads desperately. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg is fond of saying that for advertisers and their $500bn budgets, the social network is like the Super Bowl every night. She’s wrong. Facebook is way bigger than the Super Bowl. More than 1,1bn people use Facebook daily. About 110m people watch the Super Bowl telecast. Sandberg’s pitch is about convincing advertisers to think of Facebook as a place that is even bigger than TV’s biggest stage but with the stockpile of personal information to target ads only to people who are most likely to buy an Audi. In Facebook’s view, it is the best of Google’s bloodlessly efficient direct response advertising with the mass reach and charm of TV commercials. It sounds beautiful, but it turns out it can be hard to be both Google and television. The world’s biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, told the Wall Street Journal that it found targeting niches like teenage shavers on Facebook generated too narrow an audience for P&G brands that need to sells millions of bottles of Tide and Gillette razors. This seems, I don’t know, blindingly obvious? P&G said it won’t spend less money on Facebook, but it and some other big advertisers seem to be falling back in love with TV. The top 100 marketers spent 1% more on TV ads in the first quarter of this year compared with the amount in the period a year earlier, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis published in May. That was a lift from a 2% decline in their combined TV ad spending last year. P&G was among a handful of top brand advertisers — also including GM, Pepsi and Verizon — that sharply increased their TV ad spending this year after pulling back in 2015. “Investors should feel better about TV’s place in ad budgets today than they did a year ago,” Morgan Stanley wrote. What’s good for TV is probably not good for Facebook’s ambitions in brand advertising. Still, the winds are at Facebook’s back. Younger people in particular are spending more free time on their phones, including on Facebook, and less on TV. Facebook is expanding the pool of potential advertisers to small businesses that never advertised beyond the Yellow Pages. Facebook’s commitment to online video — which looks a lot like TV — helps it lure brand ads, too. It won’t be easy for Facebook, but the company knows it won’t crack the next 95% of that advertising spending unless it figures out how to become the perfect advertising medium for companies hunting for the best blend of TV and the Web.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Why SA Connect tender was cancelled 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 7A radical proposal for state-owned fibre 5MTN’s Mteto Nyati takes the fight to No 1 5One day I will tell you the truth – Zuma Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 11 August 2016 | MYT 11:00 AM Self-driving cars could force insurers to shift gears by james f. peltz Putting on the brakes: Although completely self-driving cars are already being developed by several automakers and Alphabet Inc's Google unit, the insurance industry, regulators and consumer advocates caution that myriad questions have to be answered before it's known exactly how those driverless cars will be insured. — Reuters As the driverless car gets closer to reality, so too does the dilemma of how to insure the car and its owner.  The auto insurance industry faces upheaval in the next 25 years as the migration to autonomous safety features – and ultimately a self-driving car – shifts more of a car's accident risk from the driver to the vehicle, analysts said.  The number of accidents is expected to drop sharply because more than 90% of crashes now are caused by driver error. That could lower insurance bills for consumers. The US market for personal auto insurance policies, which generates US$200bil (RM798.31bil) in premiums a year, could shrink substantially, some experts predict.  "There are going to be dramatic changes," said Joe Schneider, a managing director at KPMG who's part of the accounting firm's task force studying the issue.  A number of cars already have collision-avoidance features, such as blind-spot detectors and front-end crash-warning systems. The auto industry and federal regulators also have agreed to equip nearly every new car with automatic emergency braking systems within the next six years.  Completely self-driving cars are being developed by several auto manufacturers and Alphabet Inc's Google unit.  But the insurance industry, regulators and consumer advocates caution that myriad questions have to be answered before it's known exactly how those driverless cars will be insured.  For instance, although a driverless car might cut the risk of accidents, it still would share the road with drivers behind the wheel. How would insurance for both types of vehicles be written, and what would it cost?  "We don't want to see an environment created where you have vehicles that might not be nothing more than glorified golf carts autonomously operating among big-rig tractor trailers," said Jim Whittle, assistant general counsel for the American Insurance Association, a trade group for the insurers.  And don't expect a price cut in auto insurance any time soon. In fact, prices have been climbing in recent years because of a rise in the number of crashes that reflects more miles being driven, higher car sales and an increase in texting and other driver distractions, among other factors.  The average annual spending for car insurance nationwide was US$841.23 (RM3,357.81) in 2013, the most recent year available, up 7% from US$786.65 (RM3,139.95) in 2009, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In California, it rose to US$782.63 (RM3,123.91) from US$756.16 (RM3,018.25).  The number of crashes rose 10% to 6.06 million in 2014 from 5.51 million in 2009, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Cars with autonomous safety features are "certainly not the majority" of vehicles on the road because "the features themselves, while important in adding safety, aren't such that every use and operation of the car is now automated," California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said.  "So far, we haven't seen significant changes in claims or experience that would warrant changes in (customer) rates," Jones said.  But KPMG estimates that over the next 25 years, the number of accidents could plunge 80% from current levels, which "will go right to the core of the business" of providing car insurance, said Jerry Albright, a KPMG principal also on the task force.  Insurance bills aren't coming down yet, but "over time do we think that is going to happen? Yes," Schneider said.  Allstate Corp chairman Thomas Wilson – who has dubbed the move to driverless cars "The Jetsons," after the cartoon with spaceship-like cars – said in a speech last year that the shift could have "the most detrimental impact on auto insurance" and one "we don't want to wait" to figure out.  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Corp owns Geico insurance, told an automotive forum last year that "we would not be throwing a party at our insurance business" when self-driving cars arrive, even though that day remained "a long ways off."  Jones has ridden in Google's driverless car and held hearings to see, as he put it, "how this will impact consumer protection and how it will impact insurance markets in California. We're watching it very carefully."  All of this is careening down the road a little too fast for Jamie Court, president of the public advocacy group Consumer Watchdog.  "These technologies shouldn't be rushed to market without hearing voices from all sides" about insurance, Court said. The "robot car shouldn't be developed without a formal process for the public to weigh in with their concerns."  For instance, "our big fear is that in accidents in driverless cars, the human being is still going to be considered at fault because robots are presumed not to make mistakes," Court said.  Indeed, Buffett raised a question about accident fault that's key to the insurers' future: Exactly how much would the liability for crashes shift from drivers to the vehicles that are making most – if not all – of the safety decisions?  If it turns out that the automakers and their suppliers end up shouldering most of the liability, they might offer insurance themselves, said Donald Light, director of the North American property/casualty practice at the research firm Celent. They might even add the insurance premium to the sticker price of new cars.  "That's another big threat to the current insurance industry," Light said.  In the meantime, British company Adrian Flux Insurance Services this month launched what it said might be the first "driverless car policy" in the world.  The policy would cover existing cars using autonomous features such as self-parking and autopilot systems and would cover drivers for things such as satellite failures that disrupt the systems or hacking by outsiders.  "We wanted to help provide confidence and clarity around the ongoing debate of 'who is liable?'" Adrian Flux General Manager Gerry Bucke said in a statement.  As that debate continues, analysts agree that consumers probably still will need insurance even if they one day own self-driving cars. If a tree falls on the car or it's vandalised, for instance, they'll need coverage.  And just because the driverless car seems closer to reality doesn't mean the vehicles will be commonplace, as in The Jetsons, for many years.  One reason, as Whittle of the American Insurance Association put it, is "the simple reason that a lot of people like to drive." — Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Fido getting fat?

In addition to looking better on the Apple tablets, Google's suite of productivity tools will also introduce the auto-formatting of cells.  ( Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images ) Advertisement The latest update to the Google Docs, Sheets and Slides interface is just that simple and straightforward, yet owners of the iPad Pro still had to wait for it for months. Finally, the Split View is now available for Google's suite of documentation tools. As a result, the apps now look better on the iPad Pro. Plus, the nifty auto-formatting feature now on Google Sheets will make copy-pasting cells easier on Docs and Slides. Here are two of the latest features: 1. Split View On Google Docs, Sheets And Slides As the name suggests, the Split View will enable users to work on two different applications placed side by side on their tablet screen. It is important to note, however, that the update is exclusive to the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro as well as the iPad Air 2. Split View was first introduced to the public by way of iOS 9, but it will continue to support apps across Apple tablets when the iOS 10 is released in the fall. Today, owners of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can breathe easy knowing they don't anymore have to contend with documents and spreadsheets viewed only through the portrait mode. This is especially hard when navigating between cells and tables on a mobile platform. Bear in mind, Google did try to fix the problem a few months back, but it forget to throw in that much-loved splitscreen mode. The update this week solves all that and more. Of course, users who work on projects via a mobile device know how difficult it is just switching between apps and tabs and files. While the device's portability and touchscreen functionality make the tablet a prized tool for those on the go, having the Split View option takes the device a step further toward becoming a legitimate alternative to the laptop. Now, with a few more tweaks, mobile productivity becomes easier, faster and more polished on this new interface of the well-loved Docs and Sheets. 2. Easy Formatting Of Cells On Google Docs And Slides That's not all there is to the update, though. Users who rely heavily on Google's documentation tools will now find it easier to copy cells from Google Sheets onto Google Docs or Slides because the entries will automatically transform into a fully formatted table once pasted. Remember, however, that only up to 400 cells can be pasted onto the documents at a time. Users should also update all three Google Drive applications to maximize the new automatic feature, Android Police notes. 3. Other Google Docs And Sheets Add-Ons On top of Google's own updates, third-party developers are also lending the company a hand in producing add-ons suited for Google Docs and Sheets. In July, eight developers stepped in and introduced nifty features that complement the two apps. The range of add-ons include the digital signature tools DocuSign and PandaDoc, the QR code and barcode scanning app Scanbot, and the bibliography tool EasyBib, among others.

Amanda Schiavo Aug 10, 2016 11:52 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- It has been a year since technology giant Google rebranded itself and became Alphabet.  (GOOGL) Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin made the decision to re-brand the company in an attempt to separate its search engine business from its other tech initiatives such as cars and virtual reality. Shares of Alphabet are just coming off of fresh 52-week highs, CNBC anchor Jon Fortt reported on "Squawk Alley" on Wednesday morning. Fortt and anchor Kayla Tausche discussed Alphabet's first year. "From a core Google perspective, absolutely they've done fantastically well. Investors have gotten a clearer look into the profitability of the business," Fortt said. Looking beyond the Google segment there are a few things that haven't happened in terms of what people were expecting a year ago, such as a split and spinoff of YouTube. One thing that has come to pass is the discipline that Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat continued to talk about, Tausche said. The anchor called discipline a "buzzword" that was reoccurring throughout the quarters on the company's earnings calls. "She just did a bond deal last week to help the company mature its capital structure," Tausche added. "Unless, do you think that expenses have gone down dramatically, they really haven't. [Alphabet] is just spending them differently." Alphabet's M&A initiatives haven't slowed down, in the last 12 months it spent about $1.8 billion in about 20 deals between the two entities. Pointing out that the last year hasn't "been all sunshine and roses" Fortt noted that Alphabet's cloud direction is still unclear, calling the structure under Diane Green "odd."

 GM expands self-driving car testing to Arizona BI Intelligence Aug. 11, 2016, 1:30 AM 696 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Nexar's new app uses vehicle network and AI to avoid accidents nuTonomy will start testing self-driving vehicles in Boston Marine General 'Mad Dog' Mattis got Trump to rethink his position on torture in under an hour This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. GM will expand testing of driverless car technology to public roads in Arizona, reports TechCrunch. The tests will utilize the all-electric Chevy Bolt, developed in the wake of GM’s acquisition of Cruise Automation earlier this year. The tests will provide GM and Cruise with additional driving data to fine-tune their autonomous driving technology. GM has partnered with Lyft, and together they're aiming to begin usage tests with self-driving taxis by mid-2017. The tests will take place primarily in Scottsdale, which already hosts Google’s self-driving car testing. Elsewhere, GM and Honda are joining the License on Transfer (LOT) patent network, according to Fortune. The network, which includes Google, Hyundai, Ford, and Uber, is intended to combat patent “trolling,” in which companies with portfolios of patents that do not make products threaten to or file lawsuits. By joining the LOT network, these car companies enter into a mutual nonaggression pact, which should serve to foster development as carmakers transform into technological innovators with the advent of autonomous driving technology and ride-sharing services. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on self-driving cars that examines the major strides automakers and tech companies have made to overcome the barriers currently preventing fully autonomous cars from hitting the market. Further, the report examines global survey results showing where fully autonomous cars are highly desired. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Three barriers have been preventing fully autonomous cars from hitting the road: 1) high technological component prices; 2) varying degrees of consumer trust in the technology; and 3) relatively nonexistent regulations. However, in the past six months, there have been many advances in overcoming these barriers. Technology has been improving as new market entrants find innovative ways to expand on existing fully autonomous car technology. As a result, the price of the components required for fully autonomous cars has been dropping. Consumer trust in fully autonomous vehicle technology has increased in the past two years. California became the first US state to propose regulations. California's regulations stipulate that a fully autonomous car must have a driver behind the wheel at all times, discouraging Google's and Uber's idea of a driverless taxi system.
