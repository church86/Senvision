News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Security Google to Operate Its Own Root Certificate Authority for a More Secure Web By Rafia Shaikh Jan 26, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit HTTPS is the foundation of a more secure web, Ryan Hurst from Google’s Security and Privacy Engineering wrote in a blog post today. And to support Google’s work to implement HTTPS across all of its products, Google has been operating its own subordinate Certificate Authority (GIAG2), issued by a third-party. Google announced that the company will now be operating its own Root Certificate Authority to further support the implementation of HTTPS across all of its products. Google to operate its own Root Certificate Authority to increase product security The company has also established Google Trust Services to operate these Certificate Authorities on behalf of Google and Alphabet. GTS will be responsible for authenticating the identity of websites to ensure rapid handling of SSL/TLS certificate needs of its products. “It is clear HTTPS will continue to be a foundational technology,” the announcement read. “This is why we have made the decision to expand our current Certificate Authority efforts to include the operation of our own Root Certificate Authority.” Google has bought two existing Root Certificate Authorities, GlobalSign R2 and R4 to be able to immediately begin independent certificate issuance. Today’s announcement is another confirmation that the company is taking a keen interest in the security structure that is used to verify a website’s identity. However, some are already talking about putting all eggs in one basket. “I have no love for most the major CAs I’ve interacted with, but this feels wrong, though I can’t quite pinpoint why,” algesten wrote on Hacker News. “Perhaps just a general feeling that all the internet eggs are being put, one by one, in one single alphabet basket.” Advertisement “You can now have a website secured by a certificate issued by a Google CA, hosted on Google web infrastructure, with a domain registered using Google Domains, resolved using Google Public DNS, going over Google Fiber, in Google Chrome on a Google Chromebook. Google has officially vertically integrated the Internet,” another user quipped. Google Pixel Security Flaw Could "Facilitate Tracking" - Fix Releasing on Tuesday While this doesn’t mean any changes for the end users, developers who are building products that interact with Google service will have to include the new Root Certificates. The announcement is shared below for more information. In support of our work to implement HTTPS across all of our products (https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/https/) we have been operating our own subordinate Certificate Authority (GIAG2), issued by a third-party. This has been a key element enabling us to more rapidly handle the SSL/TLS certificate needs of Google products. As we look forward to the evolution of both the web and our own products it is clear HTTPS will continue to be a foundational technology. This is why we have made the decision to expand our current Certificate Authority efforts to include the operation of our own Root Certificate Authority. To this end, we have established Google Trust Services (https://pki.goog/), the entity we will rely on to operate these Certificate Authorities on behalf of Google and Alphabet. The process of embedding Root Certificates into products and waiting for the associated versions of those products to be broadly deployed can take time. For this reason we have also purchased two existing Root Certificate Authorities, GlobalSign R2 and R4. These Root Certificates will enable us to begin independent certificate issuance sooner rather than later. We intend to continue the operation of our existing GIAG2 subordinate Certificate Authority. This change will enable us to begin the process of migrating to our new, independent infrastructure.

Artificial intelligence that diagnoses skin cancer as well as a dermatologist could one day rest in the palm of your hand. A team from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory set up a machine-learning AI to teach itself to diagnose cancer by looking at skin lesions just as a doctor would during an exam. The team tested the algorithm against 21 board-certified dermatologists, and it performed just as well as its human counterparts. "We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist," Sebastian Thrun, an adjunct professor in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said in a statement. "That's when our thinking changed. That's when we said, 'Look, this is not just a class project for students, this is an opportunity to do something great for humanity.'" Thrun is perhaps better known as one of the founders of both Udacity and Google X. A paper on the system co-authored by him and his colleagues appeared in the journal Nature Wednesday. The researchers envision making the algorithm compatible with smartphones, putting skin cancer diagnosis into the hands of just about anyone anywhere. "Early detection is critical, as the estimated five-year survival rate for melanoma drops from over 99 percent if detected in its earliest stages to about 14 percent if detected in its latest stages," the paper reads. "We developed a computational method which may allow medical practitioners and patients to proactively track skin lesions and detect cancer earlier." The AI is a convolutional neural network, the same type of system Google uses to wallop masters of the ancient game Go. The researchers used one of Google's AI systems -- the GoogleNet Inception v3 CNN architecture, which had already been taught to visually identify different objects. But it hadn't yet been trained to tell the difference between a malignant carcinoma and a harmless skin lesion, so the team pulled together a dataset to transform the neural network into a digital dermatologist. "There's no huge dataset of skin cancer that we can just train our algorithms on, so we had to make our own," said Brett Kuprel, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab. "We gathered images from the internet and worked with the medical school to create a nice taxonomy out of data that was very messy -- the labels alone were in several languages, including German, Arabic and Latin." The coders collaborated with dermatologists and others in the medical field on the project. "Advances in computer-aided classification of benign versus malignant skin lesions could greatly assist dermatologists in improved diagnosis for challenging lesions and provide better management options for patients," said Susan Swetter, professor of dermatology and co-author of the paper. "However, rigorous prospective validation of the algorithm is necessary before it can be implemented in clinical practice, by practitioners and patients alike." Last year, Google announced that it trained an algorithm to spot diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness. Fortunately, while we wait for these sort of "doctor's helpers" forms of A.I. to hit hospitals and clinics, we can bide our time by letting the same sorts of systems kick our butts at Go and all sort of other games.         LATEST STORIES (35) Taliban’s Military Commission Chief Killed in Zabul Province 4 Palestinians Injured by Israeli Forces during Clashes in Jenin Refugee Camp Russia to Redeploy Forces, Military Equipment to Syria 10 Militants, Including ISIL Members Killed in Nangarhar Ansarullah: Saudis Attacks on Yemen to Prove Servitude to US Masters Syrian Cargo Plane Drops More Arms, Munitions over Deir Ezzur Airbase Aleppo: Syrian Gov't Forces Inch Closer to Turkish Troops near Al-Bab Muslim Advocacy Group to File Lawsuit Challenging Trump's Muslim Ban Order Yemeni Forces Foil Saudi Army's Attempt to Capture New Regions in Ta'iz Province Iranian President Blasts Trump for Building Wall along Mexico Syrian Armed Forces Launch Fresh Anti-ISIL Operation in Deir Ezzur with Russian Aerial Back up Militants in Seven More Regions End Battle against Syrian Army Syrian Analyst: Al-Nusra Deploys Forces in Western Aleppo after Astana Talks IRGC Official: US, Terrorist Groups' Supporters Marginalized in Astana Peace Talks on Syria 18 ISIL Terrorists Killed in Clashes with Iraqi Forces Taliban’s Military Commission Chief Killed in Zabul Province TEHRAN (FNA)- The military commission chief of the Taliban group was killed during an ambush of the Afghan security forces in Southern Zabul province. 4 Palestinians Injured by Israeli Forces during Clashes in Jenin Refugee Camp TEHRAN (FNA)- Four Palestinians were injured and beaten by Israeli forces during a raid in the Jenin refugee camp in the Northern occupied West Bank city of Jenin.

GoogleÕs head-on rival to the iPhone, the Pixel, is off to a modest but promising start. It is Google's first step in what it says will be a years-long effort to take on Apple where itÕs strongest. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. SAN FRANCISCO — The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. “This was probably a really good learning experience for them,” says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Doshi estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period. Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 phones that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. “Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success,” says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. “It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung,” says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer.

Mark Bergen Google CEO Sundar Pichai slammed Donald Trump’s move in a note to employees, telling them that more than 100 company staff are affected by the order. Photo: Reuters San Francisco: Alphabet Inc.’s Google delivered a sharp message to staff travelling overseas who may be impacted by a new executive order on immigration from President Donald Trump: Get back to the US now. Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai slammed Trump’s move in a note to employees on Friday, telling them that more than 100 company staff are affected by the order. “It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,” Pichai wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. “We’ve always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.” The comments underscore a growing rift between the Trump administration and several large US technology companies, which include many immigrants in their ranks and have lobbied for fewer immigration restrictions. Pichai’s note echoed similar statements from tech peers voicing concerns about the harm such policies could have on their businesses. Trump signed an executive order Friday prohibiting entry by people from seven majority-Muslim nations for 90 days. Citizens of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya would be banned from entering the US for the period, while the government determines what information it needs to safely admit visitors. The Department of Homeland Security issued a directive on Friday afternoon ordering the Customs and Border Control agency to enforce the order, the New York Daily News reported. Late Friday, some green card and visa holders were already being blocked from boarding flights to the US, the newspaper said. Also Read: Facebook’s Zuckerberg ‘concerned’ by Donald Trump immigration moves “We’re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,” a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. “We’ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.” Some Google employees were travelling abroad and were trying to get back to the US before the order took effect. The company asked them to reach out to Google’s security, travel, and immigration teams for assistance, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person asked not to be identified talking about internal company communications. The employees in question normally work in the US but just happened to be abroad either on work assignments or vacations. The concern is that even if Google staff have valid visas, they may still be at risk if they’re from one of the seven countries and they’re outside the US when the order kicks in, the person also said. One employee rushed back from a trip to New Zealand to make it into the US before the order was signed, Google’s Pichai wrote in his memo. Also Read: Donald Trump freezes refugee program, orders new vetting for entry “We are advising our clients from those seven countries who have green cards or any type of H-1B visa not to travel outside the US” said Ava Benach, a partner at immigration law firm Benach Collopy LLP, while noting that the order takes effect immediately. “No one is really sure whether a green card holder from these seven countries can return to the US now. It’s fairly clear that an H-1B visa holder can’t,” Benach said. The H-1B lets US companies employ graduate-level workers from other countries in technical occupations such as technology, engineering and science. “If anyone in these situations has the misfortune to have gone abroad recently, it’s a treacherous moment, possibly for green card holders too,” Benach said. Other technology companies are likely in a similar situation, she added. Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said Friday he was “concerned” by Trump’s recent moves to restrict immigration. Microsoft Corp. inserted language in a securities filing on Thursday on the issue, cautioning investors that immigration restrictions “may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts.” Bloomberg Mark Bergen Topics: GoogleDonald TrumpImmigration OrderGoogle Recalls StaffSundar Pichai More From Livemint READ MORE L&T Q3 rises 39% to Rs972 crore 5 soldiers trapped under heavy snow along LoC, army launches rescue operation Donald Trump’s trade-policy wild card puts US growth momentum at risk First Published: Sat, Jan 28 2017. 01 15 PM IST Editor's Picks Why we should be wary of ‘viral’ narratives about economic policy BSE listing: Sebi sets process to address potential conflict A portrait of a soldier’s wife Latest News 5 soldiers trapped under heavy snow along LoC, army launches rescue operation Donald Trump’s trade-policy wild card puts US growth momentum at risk Sunanda Pushkar’s death: Medical board fails to make any conclusion in report Pakistan hopes to host Saarc soon, accuses India to impede process Google recalls staff to US after Donald Trump immigration order Mint On Sunday How India chased off the run-chase blues Why Kamaraj does not have to wake up early this year The humanity of intelligence Dangal: Do we celebrate a father like this?

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google's Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. "I definitely think we're going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," the research firm said at the time. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company's productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter. "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy," said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. That's because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel's fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company's AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. "Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud," Moerdler said.

By Agamoni Ghosh January 28, 2017 08:04 GMT Both the upcoming watches will come pre-installed with Android Wear 2.0 Google Speculation has been rife on who will build the upcoming Android Wear 2.0 watch for Google. Fresh photo leaks now show off two round dial smartwatches with LG's seal, which look like the next Android Wear 2.0 wearables. Google confirmed weeks ago that it will launch the first of the Android Wear 2.0 watches scheduled for 2017 but its branding will neither be Nexus nor Pixel-backed. Instead it will be a Google conceptualised product manufactured by another company, which we now know is LG. Both the watches are expected to come pre-installed with the Android Wear 2.0, a crucial update that has been delayed for months now and was originally scheduled to be rolled out last year. Google wanted its wearable firmware updates to go through beta tests like the Android OS versions to have a smooth rollout to Android Wear watches with as few bugs as possible. As for the design of the two watches leaked, both have round dials with one seeming a little larger than the other. The first and clearer of the leaks is by famed tipster Evan Blass who shows off the smaller LG Watch Style in both silver and rose gold colours. The second is a photo accessed by TechnoBuffalo showing a grainy sporty styled smartwatch in black dubbed the LG Watch Sport. While the Style is expected to sport a 1.2in display, the Sport will be 1.38in thus having the larger dial. The Sport will also have NFC, cellular data, and be IP68 water resistant. The Style will also be water resistant but only IP67. Both watches are scheduled to launch in February with some rumours pointing to an MWC 2017 launch and others saying it may be as early as 9 February. It is still not clear if Google will release these smartwatches first or the Android Wear 2.0 upgrade. Check out this list to see if your Android Wear is compatible for the upcoming update.

GET IN TOUCH Nana Addo appoints Joe Anokye as acting NCA Head       Ghana News Ghana News, Ghana Politics, Ghana Sports, Ghana Business           Home 2016 Election Results Business Politics Sport Showbiz Odd But True Opinion Relationship Lifestyle Infographics TV Google parent Alphabet miss profit target Saturday 28th January , 2017 7:46 am Google parent Alphabet’s latest profit figures have missed forecasts, sending the tech giant’s shares falling in extended trading on Wall Street. Profits rose 8% to $5.3bn (£4.2bn) for the last three months of 2016, fuelled by more advertising on mobile phones and YouTube. But analysts had expected more, and Alphabet’s shares fell almost 3% . However, revenue for the quarter topped $26bn, up 22% from the same period the year before. Google’s advertising revenue, which accounts for the bulk of its business, rose 17.4% to $22.40bn in the quarter. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36%, compared with a 33% increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. “Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional,” Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a statement. “We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.” ‘Tremendous potential’ For earnings purposes, Alphabet separates operations such as self-driving cars and broadband into its Other Bets category, which nearly doubled revenue to $262m in the quarter but still posted a loss of nearly $1.1bn. Under its new structure, Alphabet is seeking to expand beyond its role as a search engine and develop new revenues streams. Ms Porat pointed to growth app sales, hardware and the cloud business. “We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube,” she said. – Source: BBC Alphabet parent company Google Tech news Jonas Nyabor Tagged with: Alphabet parent company Google Tech news More on citifmonline.com Alibaba’s Ant Financial buys MoneyGram for $880m January 27, 2017 Mark Zuckerberg dismisses presidential bid January 26, 2017 Three jailed over Taiwan ATM hack January 25, 2017 Online dating fraud victim numbers at record high January 24, 2017 Samsung blames faulty batteries for Note 7 fires January 23, 2017 Facebook just replaced your desktop inbox with Messenger January 22, 2017 General News Parliament rubbishes Ayariga’s bribery claims, but he insists it occurred January 28, 2017 Bribery allegations against Agyarko fabricated – Osei Owusu January 28, 2017 We’ll ensure Nana Addo succeeds – Osafo-Maafo January 28, 2017 Police bias against Alavanyo fanning tensions – Togbe Atakura January 28, 2017 Stopping fertiliser smuggling is key for agric – Dr. Afriyie Akoto January 28, 2017 Advertisement Recent Posts AFCON 2017: Black Stars arrive in sleepy town of Oyem Expansion of health professionals training critical – Lecturer Minerals Commission inaugurates training fund management committee E/R: Chinese Ambassador donates farming inputs to communities Google parent Alphabet miss profit target Bafta-winning actor, Sir John Hurt dies aged 77 Trump suspends US refugee programme and bans Syrians indefinitely Parliament rubbishes Ayariga’s bribery claims, but he insists it occurred Bribery allegations against Agyarko fabricated – Osei Owusu We’ll ensure Nana Addo succeeds – Osafo-Maafo Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2017 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign.” He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon.—Agencies Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleBanks ponder the meaning of life as Deutsche agonises Next articleYusuf Zafar takes over as new Chairman of PARC Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Economy Watch PIA needs well-envisioned business plan for revival Economy Watch KSE-100 benchmark dips by 228 points Economy Watch Private sectors vital to improve Pak-Spain bilateral trade Digital Newspaper Social Diary Signing ceremony of Share Purchase Agreement of PSX with the Consortium of Chinese Exchanges and local financial institutions Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor-in-Cheif: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: Khalid Butt E-Mail: obslhr@pakobserver.net Resident Editor Peshawar: Tariq Saeed E-Mail: obspwr@pakobserver.net Group Director : Khurram Jaffrani E-Mail: khurram_jaffrani@hotmail.com Director Marketing : Naveed Ahmad Khan Cell # 0300-5129008 Contact Us Online Edition : Q Malik / Ch Imran Zafar E-Mail: webmaster@pakobserver.net Islamabad: 051-2852027, 051-2852028 E-Mail : observer@pakobserver.net Karachi: 021-35308446-49 E-Mail : obskhi@pakobserver.net Lahore: 042-36306666, 36303333 E-Mail : obslhr@pakobserver.net ABOUT USHead Office Address: Daily Pakistan Observer, Ali AKbar House , Markez G-8, Islamabad Contact us: observer@pakobserver.net FOLLOW US Home Health Voice of People © Copy Rights Reserved .

Photographer: Anindito Mukherjee/Bloomberg Alphabet Inc.’s Google delivered a sharp message to staff traveling overseas who may be impacted by a new executive order on immigration from President Donald Trump: Get back to the U.S. now. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai slammed Trump’s move in a note to employees Friday, telling them that more than 100 company staff are affected by the order. "It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues," Pichai wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. "We’ve always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so." The comments underscore a growing rift between the Trump administration and several large U.S. technology companies, which include many immigrants in their ranks and have lobbied for fewer immigration restrictions. Pichai’s note echoed similar statements from tech peers voicing concerns about the harm such policies could have on their businesses. Trump signed an executive order Friday prohibiting entry by people from seven majority-Muslim nations for 90 days. Citizens of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya would be banned from entering the U.S. for the period, while the government determines what information it needs to safely admit visitors. The Department of Homeland Security issued a directive on Friday afternoon ordering the Customs and Border Control agency to enforce the order, the New York Daily News reported. Late Friday, some green card and visa holders were already being blocked from boarding flights to the U.S., the newspaper said. "We’re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.," a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. "We’ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." Some Google employees were traveling abroad and were trying to get back to the U.S. before the order took effect. The company asked them to reach out to Google’s security, travel, and immigration teams for assistance, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person asked not to be identified talking about internal company communications. The employees in question normally work in the U.S. but just happened to be abroad either on work assignments or vacations. The concern is that even if Google staff have valid visas, they may still be at risk if they’re from one of the seven countries and they’re outside the U.S. when the order kicks in, the person also said. One employee rushed back from a trip to New Zealand to make it into the U.S. before the order was signed, Google’s Pichai wrote in his memo. "We are advising our clients from those seven countries who have green cards or any type of H-1B visa not to travel outside the U.S." said Ava Benach, a partner at immigration law firm Benach Collopy LLP, while noting that the order takes effect immediately. “No one is really sure whether a green card holder from these seven countries can return to the U.S. now. It’s fairly clear that an H-1B visa holder can’t," Benach said. The H-1B lets U.S. companies employ graduate-level workers from other countries in technical occupations such as technology, engineering and science. "If anyone in these situations has the misfortune to have gone abroad recently, it’s a treacherous moment, possibly for green card holders too," Benach said. Other technology companies are likely in a similar situation, she added. Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Friday he was “concerned” by Trump’s recent moves to restrict immigration. Microsoft Corp. inserted language in a securities filing on Thursday on the issue, cautioning investors that immigration restrictions "may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts."

Now, smartphone owners are wondering when they’ll get Nougat. HTC has been one of the best in terms of keeping users informed. With that in mind, here’s what we know about upcoming HTC Android Nougat updates. Including carrier versions of the HTC 10 and the unlocked A9. Advertisement For several months now many Nexus owners have been testing and enjoying Android Nougat. It’s loaded with a lot of new features, improved battery life, multi-window mode and more. All things HTC owners should want. Technically we’re now on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which has further features and big fixes. Read: Android 6.0 vs Android 7.0 Nougat: What’s New So Far The Android N beta ended in August and quickly arrived for many. We’ve since seen betas, developer previews, and two updates. HTC promised updates within 90 days, which was before the end of 2016. They hit their mark for unlocked devices, and are now moving on to carrier models in the US as 2017 moves forward. Advertisement Advertisement Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see an update to Android 7.0 Nougat in the near future. Or Android 7.1 Nougat. HTC was first to make announcements, but LG and Motorola sent updates out first. In a surprise move during the summer of 2016 after some Google announcements, HTC confirmed three key HTC Android N software updates are in the pipeline. While only three phones were mentioned, we can expect more to probably get the same new software. Now that Android 7.0 Nougat is official and has been released, they’ve been sharing more details. HTC Android 7.0 Nougat Updates We’ve known for a while that HTC is working hard on updates. However, the release date has been a mystery. And while we’re still expecting the HTC One M9 and HTC 10 to get it, unlocked models were up first. On December 5th, the day Android 7.1.1 was released, HTC confirmed the One M9 update. Starting with the unlocked edition. Then, carrier models will get the same sometime in 2017. And now, they are starting to roll out. Android Nougat will begin rolling out to the unlocked #HTCOneM9 starting late this evening. Carrier variants to follow early next year. pic.twitter.com/O5YP1l2Mdp — HTC USA (@HTCUSA) December 5, 2016 Advertisement Above is a tweet from HTC USA on December 5th. Confirming Nougat started, and will continue into 2017. That is the only device being mentioned at this time. Update: Those with an HTC 10 on T-Mobile should be happy that Android 7.0 Nougat is rolled out on January 5th. Other carriers should follow soon, then other phones. The first HTC Android 7.0 Nougat update was the unlocked HTC 10 on November 25th. Then the HTC One M9 unlocked developer edition. Now we’re starting to see movement on HTC 10 from carriers. What about the HTC A9? Well, unlocked models should receive it starting January 16th. HTC One A9 Unlocked Owners! We have received technical approval on the Nougat OS update, and OTA will begin tonight! Advertisement — Mo Versi (@moversi) January 16, 2017 Now that those updates have finished the company is moving on to others in the US and around the globe. In fact, this week the HTC 10 Nougat update is arriving in the UK, according to HTC.  The HTC One M9 Android 7.0 Nougat update is also hitting select devices. Although no carrier-specific announcements have been made. Android Nougat for #HTCOneM9 is now also live @htc @HTCelevate @LlabTooFeR pic.twitter.com/idfWvfGSw4 Advertisement — Robert John Virrey (@rjvirrey) January 24, 2017 In closing, while HTC did hit their 90 day window and pushed updates before 2016 came to a close. That’s it. Everyone else will be waiting until right now or sometime in February. HTC was able to release Android 6.0 Marshmallow within three months last year, but only for select regions outside the United States and unlocked models. Most US carriers ended up waiting around five months, with February and March being the actual arrival. It appears that HTC is a little ahead of that schedule for Android Nougat, but not by much. We’ll keep an eye out for further information. What’s New in Android Nougat Our link at the top of the page is an in-depth look at Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7.0 Nougat, and everything that’s new and different with comparison photos. It goes over many of the key changes, so start there. As a quick recap, the HTC Android 7.0 update bring improved performance, better battery life with “Doze” features, split-screen multitasking, the recent apps button works like ALT+TAB and switches between the last used apps, and much more. Google has over 50 big changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, revamped notifications with quick reply from the pulldown bar, customizable quick setting tiles and so much more. All of that and more will complete HTC’s software upgrades. A huge addition announced back at Google IO was “Android Instant Apps” which will enable Android to install small bits of an app (say, from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. No installing an app and starting over. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, uses the app then removes those parts, and we’re done. Not to mention things like a better and improved Google Now or Search using the Google Assistant with machine learning, number blocking and call screening. That’s just a short list of many changes. Many are behind the scenes. Of course most of this will come with HTC Sense UI over the top, with additions like HTC Blinkfeed and other small tweaks that each manufacturer adds. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC uses Sense UI, and LG has their own interface over stock Android as well. Not every new feature will be implemented, others will be changed, but this is a big and exciting update to Android for all devices. HTC Android 7.1.1 Nougat Release Date As of right now it’s far too early to remotely speculate on release dates for other carriers and HTC devices. More so, we don’t know when they’ll update to Android 7.1.1 Nougat. That’s the latest release right from Google. Right now Android 7.0 is what’s being delivered. From what we’re seeing so far HTC has updated developer editions, unlocked models and is now moving to carrier phones. That means everyone with a new HTC phone should expect updates in the foreseeable future. 14 Responses 05/21/2016 Mariaelawrence Reply wonderful…!Ｉ ᴊᴜｓᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴘᴀɪᴅ 6784ＵＳＤ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏғғ ᴍʏ ʟᴀᴘᴛᴏᴘ ᴛʜɪｓ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ.

Only if you have bought a phone in the last year are you likely to have Marshmallow. I asked 8 friends what version they have on their Galaxy models, and only 2 have 6.0. Unless you throw your phone away once a year, you are abandoned as far as Android updates by manufacturers go. 06/30/2016 David Ness Reply I totally get what you’re saying. I wasn’t getting an update for my phone directly so I downloaded the Samsung Smart Switch app on my PC and installed 6.01 onto my Galaxy S6 and it was just released this month… in other words I bypassed my carrier. 08/01/2016 Ankur Reply htc are like a cheater and does not provide any android update for 816g . So i strictly recommend all not to buy phone like htc i.e. also costly and service of HTC is also very poor. 08/27/2016 Lonnie Santrock Reply I’ve had the HTC 7 8 9 and now the 10 I will never buy another HTC phone their customer service sucks. Americans and Canadians are treated differently some reason and in Canada we are not having access to the upper screen replacement I cry foul never again HTC. 08/22/2016 Claude Reply So, it seems like everyone at HTC will enjoy the benefits of the new OS and will remove their B & H app from their phones as early as late 2016.

Yet Amazon.com's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet's Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the centre of customers'lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. "When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet," said Mr Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mr Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokesman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. "The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month," she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple's system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an US$0.50 (S$0.71) to US$2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known Star Wars toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. "They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not certified," said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Mr Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. "We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid." AMAZON'S "OPEN" APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the "Works with Alexa" label -which isn't required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon's website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the "Works with Alexa" label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you're outside the house.) "It also makes for a better user experience," notes Mr Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. "You'll experience some latency if you're always having to bounce off the cloud" as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget's companion app first, set up the device, then add a "skill" to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the US. "If that experience isn't good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad," said Mr John Neilson, the company's chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokesman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. "The danger I see for Apple and the home is they're assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare," said Mr Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. "I wouldn't say that's certain yet."

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson.

Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist.

SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’..

Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind last year established the non-profit organization, called “Partnership on AI,” which will have its inaugural board meeting in San Francisco on February 3. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Apple “has been involved and collaborating with the partnership since before it was first announced and is thrilled to formalize its membership,” the alliance said in an online post. Major technology firms joined forces in the group, with stated aims including cooperation on “best practices” for AI and using the technology “to benefit people and society.” Creation of the group came amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies “will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology,” according to a statement. Internet giants have been investing heavily in creating software to help machines think more like people, ideally acting as virtual assistants who get to know users and perhaps even anticipate needs. SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in 2015 took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. Read: As regulators waver, Apple takes on Qualcomm in courts Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. A concern expressed by Musk was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole. People joining tech company executives on the Partnership board included Dario Amodei of Open AI along with members of the American Civil Liberties Union; the MacArthur Foundation, and the University of California, Berkeley.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Google took down 1.7 billion ‘bad’ ads in 2016 Google took down 1.7 billion ‘bad’ ads in 2016 Last year, Google expanded policies to better protect users from misleading and predatory offers as well as it beefed up its technology to spot and disable bad ads even faster. By: IANS | New Delhi | Published:January 28, 2017 10:29 am Google logo. To protect consumers from misleading, inappropriate or harmful ads, Google on Friday announced that it took down 1.7 billion ads in 2016 that violated its advertising policies. The number is more than double the amount of bad ads it took down in 2015, the company said in its annual “Better Ads Report”. “Bad ads promote illegal products and unrealistic offers and can trick people into sharing personal information and infect devices with harmful software. They pose a threat to users, Google’s partners and the sustainability of the open web itself,” Scott Spencer, Director of Product Management, Sustainable Ads, said in a statement. Last year, Google expanded policies to better protect users from misleading and predatory offers as well as it beefed up its technology to spot and disable bad ads even faster. Watch What Else Is Making News? Google introduced a policy to ban ads for payday loans, which often result in unaffordable payments and high default rates for users. Within six months, the technology giant disabled more than five million payday loan ads. Also, Google detected and disabled 112 million ads for “trick to click” ads — six times more than in 2015. “Trick to click” ads often appear as system warnings to deceive users into clicking on them, not realising they are often downloading harmful software or malware. According to the report, most common inappropriate online ads were Ads for illegal products. Google disabled more than 68 million bad ads for healthcare violations and 17 million bad ads for illegal gambling violations in 2016. Google also removed 80 million deceiving and misleading ads that gave false information such as the ones which offered miracle cures that helped “people lose 50 pounds in three days without lifting a finger”. With the rise of a new type of scammers called, tabloid cloakers who take advantage of current trends and hot topics, Google suspended over 1,300 accounts for tabloid cloaking in 2016. “In December alone, Google took down 22 cloakers that were responsible for ads seen over 20 million times by people online in a single week,” the company said. Further, Google took action on 47,000 sites for promoting content and products related to weight-loss scams last year. Google recently introduced stricter policies including the new “AdSense” content policy. The policy update enables the company to take action against website owners misrepresenting who these are and deceiving users with their content.

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. "I definitely think we’re going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. ‘DISRUPTIVE FORCES’ More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. In early trading Friday, Microsoft was up 1.6 percent, Google was down 1.1 percent and Intel gained less than 1 percent. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter.  "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier." MICROSOFT'S EFFORT Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.  Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. "Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud," Moerdler said. "Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

When Google Home launched late last fall, it only supported three Internet of Things systems: Nest, Philips Hue, and Samsung SmartThings. If you’ve been hoping for more options, you’re in luck — the search giant is expanding the Assistant’s capabilities with support for Belkin’s WeMo platform as well as Honeywell’s devices. Google Home is the company’s Amazon Echo competitor, and it’s powered by the Google Assistant. You can ask the Assistant search queries, control smart-home products that are supported, cast Netflix to your TV if you have a Chromecast — you get the idea. The Assistant is available on the Google Pixel smartphone, and will gradually make its way to Android Wear smartwatches, Chromebooks, Android TV devices, and more. Google opened up Assistant to third-party developers in December. More: Google Home review While Google says more smart-home partners are “coming soon,” you can now use devices on Belkin’s WeMo platform such as smart switches, LED bulbs, as well as security cameras. Honeywell’s portfolio of products is now supported as well, including its smart thermostats. If you have products from these two platforms, all you need to do to set them up is open the Google Home app, swipe the left edge for the sidebar, and tap on “Home Control.” Press the plus sign on the bottom right to add your supported device. But more importantly, Google says you’ll soon be able to control your smart home products with the Assistant on the Google Pixel. The company’s goal is to make Assistant able enough to perform the same functions across all devices to offer a consistent experience. Some features will be specific to the product, though, such as how you can play an emoji texting game with the Assistant in Allo, Google’s messaging app. More: Google Pixel review Assistant can do many things on the Home that it can’t on the Pixel, but there are some things it can do on the Pixel and not yet on the Home, like creating a reminder. This integration of Home Control for the Pixel is a small step, but it’s encouraging to see Google is committed to unifying the experience. Also watch: Share

Google Home builds out its ecosystem with Honeywell and Belkin WeMo support Posted Jan 24, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Google launches the fifth and final dev preview of Android Wear 2.0 ahead of February launch Google was a bit late to the connected home party. Its Amazon Echo competitor, Home, officially launched in November of last year, and slowly but surely, the company has been adding some key partners to help expand its reach. Last year, Nest, Philips Hue and Samsung SmartThings all were added to Google’s burgeoning connected home ecosystem, and today the company’s got a pair of new partners. First up is Honeywell, bringing the 111-year-old conglomerate’s connected thermostats into the fold, with commands like, “Ok Google, turn the temperature up downstairs.” The company also struck a deal with Belkin for its WeMo line of home automation switches and plugs. They can be connected to home as of this week, with commands like, “Ok Google, did I leave the bedroom lights on?” While the selection of official partners is still relatively sparse, the company handily points out that users can add even more commands via IFTTT. Perhaps even more compelling is the fact that Google’s also bringing home automation to its popular Pixel handset at some point in the near future, in an attempt to create a more consistent Home experience across its ecosystem of devices. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes google home Google Hardware Popular Posts Featured Stories Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:45 | Crunch Report Weekly Roundup: AppDynamics sells to Cisco ahead of IPO, CZI buys Meta 12 hours ago | Anna Escher Apple aims to up its AI smarts with iCloud user data in iOS 10.3 17 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields 18 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off yesterday | Matthew Lynley Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | Galaxy S8 Coming in March 5 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Snap will reportedly file publicly for its massive IPO late next week 9 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Twitter releases national security letters 10 hours ago | Kate Conger Zuckerberg defends immigrants threatened by Trump 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by Up Next Google launches the fifth and final dev preview of Android Wear 2.0 ahead of February launch Posted Jan 24, 2017 CrunchBoard Job Listings Senior Developer - 41399BR at Harvard University - Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Cambridge, MA, United States) Engineer: Client Support Center at Target (Brooklyn Park, MN, United States) Product Manager at Calldorado (Kongens Lyngby (Copenhagen), Denmark) IT Infrastructure Manager (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland; Berlin, Deutschland) Digital Strategies Manager at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolinas Realty (Charlotte, NC, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Julia Love and Anya George Tharakan Reuters Published Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 4:39PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 7:09AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates on Thursday, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company’s progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Google’s revenue, rising 17.4 per cent to $22.4-billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company’s other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 per cent to $3.4-billion. “We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube,” Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 per cent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 per cent, compared to 19 per cent for the year over all, contributing to the dent in profitability. “If you look above that, it’s business as usual,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. “There has been no margin compression in the actual business.” Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company’s line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. “We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people,” he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92-billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 per cent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 per cent, compared with a 33 per cent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 per cent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 per cent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet’s Other Bets revenue increased to $262-million from $150-million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09-billion narrowed from $1.21-billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company’s research facility that works on “moon shot” ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800-million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet’s greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure,” he said. “It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google’s cash backing them.” Alphabet’s net income rose to $5.33-billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92-billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More N.B. couple used giant manure heap to harass neighbours, judge rules Douglas Quan  01.28.2017 For almost a year, this manure pile sat on the edge of David and Joan Gallant’s property in Indian Mountain, N.B., as part of an escalating feud with their neighbours. “The manure was piled high and a photo taken by Google (Earth) from a satellite shows it.” “The manure was fresh, unseasoned, wet, raw manure. The smell was disgusting,” David Gallant said. ShareAdjustCommentPrint So massive was the pile of manure lining the edge of David and Joan Gallant’s property in rural New Brunswick, it could be seen using satellite imagery. And the stench? Unbearable, they said. Especially after it rained or when the wind blew from the east. But despite the Gallants’ repeated complaints to neighbours Lee and Shirley Murray, the pile of poop just sat there for almost a year, part of an ugly — and escalating — dispute. The Murrays had without question set out to make the Gallants’ lives “miserable,” Court of Queen’s Bench Justice George Rideout said in a recent decision. “The manure was piled high and a photo taken by Google (Earth) from a satellite shows it.” And the Murrays’ offensive actions didn’t stop there, the judge said. The Murrays used a snowblower to send snow and rocks onto the Gallants’ property and likely were behind the escape of numerous cows onto their property, causing extensive hoof damage to the lawn. “I have little doubt these activities were initiated by the Murrays and designed to inflict fear, nuisance and harassment against the Gallants,” the judge said. The manure was fresh, unseasoned, wet, raw manure. The smell was disgusting. Reached by phone, Lee Murray said Friday he and his wife planned to appeal, insisting that they were the ones who had been harassed and that their one-time friends had “made a big fuss over nothing” and were just looking for money. “There’s more to this,” he said. “This thing isn’t over yet.” The Gallants purchased their property from the Murrays in Indian Mountain, just outside Moncton, in 2001. The Murray property borders the Gallant property on three sides. It is not clear from the court records when or what caused the relationship between the two couples to sour. But in court affidavits, the Gallants say things got really bad when, over the course of several days in November 2013, the Murrays deposited hundreds of loads of cow manure along a strip of land next to their property. On one occasion, the Gallants said they were awoken at 4 a.m. by the sound of a loader dumping manure. “I called Lee Murray on his cellphone to complain, but he hung up on me,” David Gallant, who is retired, said in his affidavit. “The manure was fresh, unseasoned, wet, raw manure. The smell was disgusting,” he said. It was just the beginning of a long string of complaints documented by the Gallants. In March 2014, they alleged, the Murrays used their snowblower to blow snow and rocks onto their property. In May 2014, they alleged that about 50 cattle from the Murray property escaped through a gate, causing extensive damage to their lawn from “hoofprint holes” and damage to three trees. “I saw cow dung all over our property,” David Gallant said in his affidavit. In September 2014, they say that Lee Murray put a large bale of hay near their back fence, “with the presumably intentional effect that it drew his cattle to eat, urinate and defecate as close to our house as possible.” It was around this time that the Gallants filed a complaint with the New Brunswick Farm Practices Review Board regarding the pile of manure. The following month, the Murrays finally removed the manure pile, but in the process of doing so, the Gallants alleged, they started a brush fire that caused smoke to enter their garage. In December 2014, the Farm Practices Review Board held a hearing and concluded that the cattle escape and placement of manure near the Gallants’ property constituted “unacceptable farming practices” and recommended a number of changes. The very next day the Gallants said they found a long scratch along the side of their car. “It is very unusual to observe this kind of vandalism where we live, on a rural road where the properties are very large and far apart from each other,” David Gallant said. In early 2015, the Gallants sued the Murrays in an effort to stop what they said was an “increasing pattern of aggression.” The judge opens his Jan. 19 decision with this observation: “When neighbours fight, nothing good results. The case now before the court proves this adage.” Rideout said he had “no hesitation” in finding that the Murrays’ conduct had been “wilful and reprehensible” and awarded the Gallants $15,000 in damages. (The judge noted that the Murrays’ insurance company had previously covered damage related to the cattle escape.) He also issued an injunction forbidding the Murrays from entering the Gallants’ property; spreading manure within 300 metres of their property; blowing snow, rocks or manure onto their property; and communicating with the Gallants, except in writing. The Gallants could not be reached Friday. Murray, who reportedly pleaded guilty last year in a separate case to failing to obtain the proper permits to have more than 19 head of cattle, insisted the manure he had dumped next to the Gallants’ property was old and did not give off an odour. And the debris that was blown onto their property was merely “small shovelfuls.” Murray insisted he gets along with all of his other neighbours and that over the Christmas holidays, he helped spread gravel on their driveways. If neighbours get into a disagreement, they should resolve things by talking, Murray said. Never, he said, was he looking to aggravate the Gallants. “I’m not that type of guy.” • Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh-based space startup company, is in line to receive a slice of a $1 million “Diversity Prize” from Google's Lunar XPrize despite formally dropping out of the race to the moon last month. Google and XPrize announced Tuesday that it would split the Diversity Prize among 16 current and past teams. “XPrize and Google have been awestruck by the educational outreach activities conducted by all of the competing teams and have decided to split the $1 million Diversity Prize across all 16 teams to recognize each of their unique approaches and initiatives over the years,” Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, senior director of the Google Lunar XPrize, said in a statement. “Each of these teams has pushed the boundaries to demonstrate that you don't have to be a government superpower to send a mission to the moon, while inspiring audiences to pursue the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.” Five teams remain in the competition. The teams must land on the moon, travel 500 meters across its surface and send high-definition video and images back to Earth by the end of 2017 to win the $20 million prize. Astrobotic, a Carnegie Mellon University spinoff company headquartered in the Strip District, bowed out of the competition in December when its CEO John Thornton said the company would not be ready for a 2017 launch. Thornton said the company still intends to land on the moon and establish itself as a lunar delivery service. Thornton said he doubts any of the remaining teams actually will land on the moon by the end of the year. The five remaining teams are: • SpaceIL, an Israeli nonprofit that plans to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket; • Moon Express, a Florida-based company flying on a Rocket Lab USA rocket; • Synergy Moon, an international collaboration that will use an ocean-launched rocket from California-based Interorbital Systems; • TeamIndus, an Indian team launching on the Indian Space Research Organizations Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle; and, • HAKUTO, a Japanese company whose rover will catch a ride with TeamIndus to the moon.

Google parent Alphabet's fourth quarter earnings report suggests that Google's attempts to broaden its revenue streams over the past several years may finally be beginning to gain some traction. Alphabet Thursday reported net income of $5.3 billion and earnings per share of $9.36 on revenues of $26.1 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31. The numbers represented a 22 percent increase in revenue year over year and a more modest 8.3 percent hike in income from the $4.9 billion reported in the same quarter a year ago. The earnings per share was about 30 cents less that Wall Street's expectations for the quarter, and briefly pushed Google's share prices down by nearly two percent in early trading Friday. In a repeat of the previous quarter, mobile ads and advertisements on YouTube led Google's revenue growth this time around as well. "Advertising revenue growth was driven by mobile search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic [ads]," Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said in the earnings call Thursday. "We also had substantial growth in other revenues from hardware, Play and cloud," she said. In fact, about 13 percent—or $3.4 billion—of the Google segment's $25.8 billion in revenues for the quarter, came from non-advertising sources. That is more revenues than Google's non-advertising businesses have ever generated in a single quarter and represented a 62 percent jump over the same quarter one year ago. "The fact that "other revenues" represent 13 percent of the total revenue is encouraging since it mixes revenues as diverse as hardware sales, Google Play store revenues and corporate cloud services," said Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester Research. But what's not clear is just how much each of these segments contributed to that revenue growth. For instance, it's unclear whether hardware sales were a major factor considering that Google's new Pixel smartphones and Google Home only just started shipping, he said. Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said the lack of details surrounding sales of Pixel and Google Home in the latest earnings report is disappointing. "If they were performing well, numbers would have been disclosed," he said. Besides the surge in revenues from Google's other business, the quarter held few surprises, Husson said. "Alphabet's reorg and Google's core advertising business have offered good predictability and stability in the revenues," he said. As expected, aggregate costs-per-clicks on mobile, or what Google earns from each click on an ad in mobile search, declined in the last quarter. The general expectation is that Google will make this up in higher volumes. Even so, the decrease was higher than the consensus average, Husson said. "I'd argue that the stability of Google's revenue in the next two to three years would depend on their ability to maintain the growth of mobile revenues," he said. "While there might be slower growth, the mid term prospect looks good given the fact that advertisers will wake up to the mobile Web opportunity after having focused too much on mobile apps." Meanwhile, Alphabet’s "other bets", which include former Google moonshot ventures like Verily, Calico, X, Google Fiber and Nest Labs continued to swim in red, but not as much as previously. In the past quarter Alphabet's ‘other bets’ generated $262 million in revenue, up 75 percent from the same quarter a year ago. The operating loss from these businesses at $1.1 billion was about 10 percent less than the previous year.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Microsoft Azure Cloud Services Nearly Double in Size During Past Year Revenue From Google Cloud, Hardware, Play Units Jump in Q4 Microsoft Earnings Continue to Ride High on a Cloud Google Touts Security Measures for Its Open Source Hypervisor Platform9 Building Open-Source AWS Lambda Alternative                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

For iOS users, you'll get the added benefit in Docs to insert header, footer, page numbers, change page size, and more.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Apps & Software Image Source: Google Blog Here are all the cities where Google Maps will help you find a parking spot Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal January 26th, 2017 at 6:32 PM Share Tweet Earlier this month, Google began rolling out a new feature for its Maps service that shows how difficult it’s going to be to find parking at your intended destination. If you’re going into the city to see a movie, you can now check Google Maps for a small icon that tells you how much trouble you’re likely to have finding a spot. Don't Miss: Google Pixel 2: Detailed report reveals potential specs, budget model “To see how hard it might be to park where you’re headed, just get directions to your destination and look for the parking difficulty icon in the directions card at the bottom of the screen,” Google explains. “Parking difficulties range from limited to medium to easy and are based on historical parking data.” Without a doubt, this is one of the more clever and interesting additions to Google Maps in recent memory, but there’s a catch. Like many new features, the parking difficulty indicator will only show up if you live in one of the twenty five cities that Google chose for the initial rollout of the feature. This is the current list of all the cities where the parking difficulty feature has rolled out: San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Diego, St. Louis, Tampa, Washington, DC, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento As you can see, only major metro areas are able to access the feature for now, but more cities should join the list eventually. Google hasn’t yet announced a potential time frame for an expansion though.

 Google's Q4 profit comes up short and the stock takes a hit Steve Kovach Jan. 26, 2017, 3:45 PM 8,195 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alphabet CEO Larry Page.AP Alphabet's stock sank in after hours trading on Thursday after the Google-parent company missed Wall Street's earnings target. Google’s mobile search and video ads boosted revenue in the fourth quarter, but increased spending in hardware and other new businesses, as well as a larger-than-expected tax rate, weighted on the bottom line. Alphabet stock was down about 2% at $814.80 in after-hours trading on Thursday. Here are the key numbers from Q4: Revenue: $26.06 billion, up 22% year-on-year and above the $25.2 billion expected by analysts EPS (adjusted): $9.36 versus $9.67 expected by analysts Cost of revenues: $10.66 billion (up from $8.188 billion in the year-ago quarter) Paid clicks on Google properties: Up 43% year over year Paid click on Google Network Members' properties: Up 7% year over year Cost-per-click on Google properties: -16% year over year Cost-per-click on Google Network Members' properties: -19% year over year Other Bets revenues: $262 million (was $150 million in the year-ago quarter) Other Bets operating loss: $1.088 billion (was $1.21 billion in the year-ago quarter) "Other revenues" were up 62% year over year. That figure represents hardware, which Google has increasingly focused on with the launch of new products like the Google Pixel phone, Daydream View virtual reality headset, and Google Home voice-controlled speaker. In addition to the hard numbers, investors had their eyes on Alphabet's Other Bets companies — the collection of "moonshot" businesses focused on everything ffrom self-driving cars to biotech. Alphabet ended several projects and lost many top executives and leaders during the back half of 2016. The moves were designed to help cut costs from Other Bets, which have yet to generate any meaningful revenue for Alphabet. Alphabet's CFO, Ruth Porat, only briefly touched on Other Bets in her opening remarks during the company's earnings call, saying she will continue to look at investments in those projects. One Other Bet that did get some positive attention this week: Verily. On Thursday morning, Alphabet announced that Verily, which develops health technology like smart contact lenses, received a $800 million investment from a private firm based in Singapore. During the call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai touched a lot on Google's main new areas of investment like hardware, cloud services, and YouTube. However, Pichai wouldn't give any hard numbers for subscribers to paid YouTube services like YouTube Red or YouTube Music, saying only it was "early days" for those products. As for voice search, which is built into the Home speaker and other Google products and services, Pichai slightly downplayed its importance, saying voice is just one way users will interact with Google. One concern with the growth in voice search is that Google won't be able to sell ads against it like it can with search on mobile or desktop. Pichai said he sees this problem as "more of an opportunity than a challenge."

Matthew Heller January 27, 2017 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Google-parent Alphabet posted lower-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter but its push to develop non-advertising revenue sources may be gaining some traction. The company earned $9.36 per share, adjusted and excluding items, on revenues of $26.06 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of about $9.64 per share on $25.26 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. Recommended Stories: Caterpillar Beats Q4 Estimates, Lowers Outlook Ford Swings to $783M Loss on Special Charges Cost-Cutting Pays off for Boeing in 4th Quarter Alphabet blamed the earnings miss on a one-time tax adjustment. Eighty-seven percent of Google’s revenue is still from ad sales, rising 17.4% to $22.4 billion in the last quarter. But non-advertising revenue increased 62% to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by a mixture of hardware sales, media, and app sales through the Google Play store. The hardware products include Pixel smartphones, Google Home voice-controlled speakers, and virtual-reality headsets for smartphones. “We see tremendous potential in these businesses,” CFO Ruth Porat said in an earnings call, adding that Google is also investing in machine learning and “next-generation” computing systems. As The Wall Street Journal reports, Google is investing heavily to boost its non-advertising businesses. Capital expenditures soared by nearly a billion dollars to $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter. “Much of that spending is for building new data centers, in part to help the company compete against Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in its cloud business of selling computing power and data storage over the internet,” the WSJ said. Porat also said Google had “only begun to scratch the surface” with newer forms of advertising such as mobile search, YouTube and automated ad buying. “There are “sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped,” she said. At Other Bets, the collection of startups that make up Alphabet outside of Google, revenue rose 75% to $262 million in the fourth quarter, while the operating loss narrowed 10% to $1.09 billion from a year prior. “Although Alphabet has grand designs on changing the world with self-driving cars, cures for disease, internet balloons, and all sorts of other fantastical projects, for now those ambitions are mostly money pits,” Quartz cautioned.

The digital advertising company, which receives 90% of its revenue from advertisers has revealed in its blog that it is actively tackling the “bad ads” that “promote illegal products and unrealistic offers” or “trick people into sharing personal information and infect devices with harmful software.” Scott Spencer, director of product management for sustainable ads, said the company has a “strict set of policies that govern the types of ads we do and don’t allow on Google in order to protect people from misleading, inappropriate, or harmful ads.” “We have a team of engineers, policy experts, product managers and others who are waging a daily fight against bad actors.” Google allegedly disabled more than 5m payday loan ads following the introduction of its new payday loan policy in July 2016, as well as disabled 112m ‘trick to click’ ads – ads which scare users with system warnings – by using “beefed up” technology. Among the results, Google also claims to have removed 68m bad ads for illegal pharmaceutical products, up from 12.5m ads removed in 2015, as well as 17m ads promoting illegal gambling. Spencer noted the company’s push on disabling ads that mislead the public, taking down almost 80m bad ads for deceiving or shocking users. While the blog did not directly address advertising on fake news websites, Spencer said a website which misled consumers and promoted bad ads could be suspended. Related Content Google targets intrusive interstitials in changes to mobile search rankings News How to improve your ranking with Google search Opinion Google introduced an AdSense misrepresentative content policy in November last year to tackle website owners using the company’s AdSense platform, who were misrepresenting themselves and deceiving users with content. The AdSense misrepresentative content policy targets fake news sites, sites trying to obtain personal data and plagiarised term papers. The blog claims Google has reviewed 550 sites since the policy was introduced, and has taken action against 340 which violated policies, with almost 200 publishers being removed from its AdSense network. “When a publisher violates our policies, we may stop showing ads on their site, or even terminate their account,” Spencer said. Google also said it is managing ads that self-click, promote malicious websites and “tabloid cloakers”, that attempt to use timely topics to attract consumers; however, it is not clear whether it can pull ads from websites that are not obviously flagged. While Spencer said the company has put the right steps in place to remove ads that can “ruin the online experience,” he believes scammers will continue to invest to trick Google systems. “While we took down more bad ads in 2016 than ever before, the battle doesn’t end here,” he said. “Continuing to find and fight them is essential to protecting people online and ensuring you get the very best from the open web.” Zoe Samios Zoe Samios is a reporter at Mumbrella mainly covering creative agencies.

Both companies have added an icon on their apps for the Play store, which users can tap to recharge the account. The minimum amount that can be recharged on Play stands at Rs 100 with the maximum amount capped at Rs 1,500 at a time. It appears that both companies are using Google Play Gift Cards to enable the recharges, although it’s not clear if Google has tied-up with them for the same. Using either platform to recharge provides users with a redeemable code that can be used in Google Play to credit the said amount. Users get the full value of the recharge, as digital gift cards don’t cost anything. The recharge can then be used to make any payment on Google Play, including for apps, music, books etc. There is however, no way to refund this amount back to a user’s bank account from Google Play, as according to Google’s refund policy, “Refunds can only be issued for gifts which have not been redeemed.” It’s not clear if Freecharge and Paytm will offer refunds for the recharges in case of an accidental purchase. Interestingly, Paytm and Freecharge adding this feature comes days after Google finally launched carrier billing with Airtel and Vodafone, two of India’s largest telecom operators. This is in addition to Idea Cellular, with which it has had a tie up for a while. Advertisement Note that we had said before that it was surprising that given the growth in the wallets business over the last three years – especially in the last year – Google Play Store still hasn’t tied up with any wallet company. With this move, wallets companies seem to have taken to initiative to enable payments rather than Google itself. Either way, the new features should make it significantly easier for users to make purchases on Google Play. 01 Related #Apps #Freecharge #Google #Internet #Mobile #Paytm Related Updated: Google Play Store launches carrier billing with Airtel & Vodafone; Wallets?

Instant Apps was debuted in May last year during Google I/O 2016 developer conference. The feature works by splitting an app into multiple URL modules. A user can load an app by clicking on an Instant App URL, and developers will have to partition their apps into bits of executable pieces which is put together while clicking on an Instant App link. Google says that it worked with a small number of developers from companies like BuzzFeed, Wish, Periscope, and Viki, “collecting user feedback and iterating on the product”. Apps from these companies will now be available for Android developers/users as a beta release. The company added that an Android developer will first need to “modularize” their apps so that it can be downloaded and executed instantly. Developers can perform this using existing Android APIs and Android Studio development platform. Google says that developers will first need to “get rid” of any unknown/unused Android permissions, third-party permissions and libraries to make the app compatible with Instant Apps. Apart from this, apps need to be encoded with URL-based navigation using “App Links” feature which allows Instant Apps to automatically handle web/URL links. Apps will need to be structured into “URL-addressable modules” that are under 4MB in size. Apps higher than 4MB in size will need to be “refactored” into smaller modules, which can be downloaded and run individually. More on this here. Advertisement With this google will officially blur the line between apps and web pages, allowing the user to have an app-like experience on browsers without tediously going to the play store, downloading and installing the app. Instant Apps will now allow developers to create a shareable link and share it on Twitter/Facebook and other social platforms–this eases marketing and promotion effort. In addition, the memory space constraint for a user is eliminated since they don’t need to download or install the app manually. Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Google also provides a similar “instant loading” feature with its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for all mobile browsers, which was launched in October 2015. It allows users to load web page faster on mobile using an external Google code built into web pages. The feature was later extended for news articles and allowed independent publishers, news organizations to sign up and even run ads over AMP.   00 Related #Apps #developers #Google #Instant Apps #Internet #Mobile Related Apple’s WWDC 2016: What’s in it for developers?

But once the easy optimisations are done, you have to be a little more aggressive with your improvements. Google nearly took it too far with the latest Chrome, which was originally going to massively "throttle" background tabs... a change that would have busted popular web apps including Slack and Discord. It seems logical to limit, or throttle, the resources of browser tabs you're not looking at, providing more for the foreground tab and the operating system in general. This was a feature Google was planning to roll-out in Chrome 56, but after activating it in the browser's beta, decided to hold back after receiving some troubling feedback from testers. As web developer Samuel Reed writes, the idea behind the throttling feature was to give each background tab a budget. Exceed that budget and the tab would have to wait a while — potentially minutes — before it could do anything. So what's the problem? I'll let Reed explain: This is generally a Good Thing. Browser vendors should be concerned about battery life, and this will do a lot to help. Unfortunately, this implementation is ignoring the new reality: the browser is no longer just a reading device; it is the world's largest application platform. This will break the web. Reed goes on to detail how web apps the rely on behind-the-scenes processing for say, notifications, would be wrecked by this change. Fortunately, Google didn't ignore the outcry and held the optimisation back for further work: Unfortunately, our current implementation throttles WebSockets. Because of this we ARE NOT SHIPPING this intervention in M56. The current plan is to disable time-budget background timer throttling for the pages with active connection (websocket, webrtc and server-sent events) and to ship in M57 (subject to further feedback). We will keep you updated with the progress. Definitely an improvement, but one Google will likely want to test extensively before Chrome 57 arrives... [STRML] Comments brettanthony @brettanthony Jan 28, 2017, 12:48pm I actually think this should be standard in all browsers. We need to change our design paradigm based on the fact that browser's may "limit" resources while not in use (background tabs etc), code around that and start building/designing our web apps to be more "efficient" not only while active, but also inactive. The browser has become an OS, it may as well start acting like one. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log in Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Name: Subject: Message: Android emoji – everything you need to know Features How To The Bestby Edgar Cervantes8 hours ago 4 358 15 Emoji seem to have taken over the world, with emoticons quickly becoming a dying tongue around the inter webs. And for good reason; these little icons offer a convenient and friendly way to express emotions. Even turds look cute when pictured as emoji! But what about us Android users and enthusiasts? You may recall that for a while emoji just showed up as lame squares, and in some cases that continues to be the case. This is because the first major phone maker to adopt these was Apple, in an attempt to attract more users from Japan (where emoji first became popular). It didn’t take long for this to explode and become the amazingly popular trend it now is, with most smartphone users adopting the cute hieroglyphs. See also: Where did emoji come from? November 2, 2016 Want to learn more about how emoji came to be? We have gone through the whole story in a separate post, which you will find right above. What matters here is that Android now has support for emoji (and has for a while, of course), but your experience will vary depending on multiple factors. Our plan here is to take you through an extensive guide on the Android emoji experience. Shall we get started? Not always supported! While Android does officially support emoji, these cute icons don’t exactly work with every device. Emoji officially entered the Android world with version 4.1 Jelly Bean, but those were black and white versions of the colored symbols. It wasn’t until Android 4.4 KitKat that Google decided to integrate colored emoji to their operating system. Then came Android 7.0, which brought compatibility with Unicode 9 emoji. This means your experience will vary depending on the device and software version you are touting. It’s worth noting the vast majority of people are somewhere above Android 4.1, though. According to Statista, only about 2% of Android owners were using anything under Android 4.1 as of September 2016. This means most of you can enjoy emoji at least to a certain extent. You probably know whether your phone sports emoji support or not, and how these would look. Are you seeing a bunch of squares when iPhone users send you messages? Do you see simpler icons in black and white? You know the deal. Apps with emoji support Regardless of whether your phone supports emoji or not, the experience won’t be as streamlined as we wish. Some applications will get emoji support only with certain Android versions. The guys over at caniemoji.com have put together a table clearly showing where each of the most popular apps stand. Let’s take a look. We will go through some of the most popular apps with native emoji capabilities. Facebook Messenger This tool, which has replaced every other form of communication for many of us, comes with integrated support for emoji. There is a button on the bottom corner of the screen, when you open a conversation, which shows four little faces. Just tap on it and you will be presented with a plethora of emoji to use on your conversations. Furthermore, if you are worried about having emoji support for text messaging, you will be glad to know the app can also replace your stock SMS app. Download Facebook Messenger WhatsApp In WhatsApp you can simply open a conversation and tap the happy face icon located on the bottom-left corner of the screen. There’s all kinds of emoji there! Download WhatsApp Hangouts We know it’s hard to get people to use Hangouts, but also know the true Android fans out there stay true to Google’s messaging service and utilize it whenever they get a chance, so we just had to add this service here. Getting to the emoji is easy. Open a conversation and look at the bottom-left corner of the screen. There will be a happy face there, which will unveil all supported emoji with simple tap. Download Hangouts Google Messenger Most Android phones nowadays come with Messenger pre-installed, but that wasn’t always the case. Some phones still prefer going with alternative apps. The good news is anyone can get this application from the Google Play Store. This SMS app is simple, yet feature-full. But let’s get to the point – one of its wonders is native emoji support. Simply open or start an SMS conversation and look towards the bottom-right section of the screen. Once again, the smiley face will be there. Tap it to see all available emoji. Download Google Messenger Google Allo Allo is Google’s own WhatsApp-like service. The application links to your phone number and Google account, offering all kinds of neat messaging features. Among them is full emoji support. These can be found on the bottom-right corner of a conversation screen. Download Google Allo Snapchat Snapchat and its disposable nature also make for a good emoji conversation. You can even create your own emoji characters! They call these “Bitmoji”, but that is a whole other story. The point is you can totally make use of all those happy faces within the app. They become available when creating a snap or sending a message. Within the message screen, simply open a conversation and the option will appear on the bottom-right corner of the screen. Download Snapchat Skype Still using Skype? You can enjoy emoji too! Just open any thread and find it on the bottom-left area of the screen, next to the text input option. Download Skype Keyboards with emoji support Sometimes you just don’t want to deal with app solutions. All these services have emoji options in varying areas and deal with them in different ways, making for an inconsistent experience. Using emoji straight from the keyboard may be a better alternative. There is a sea of keyboards with emoji support out there, but we will give you a few of the most popular ones to get you started. Gboard Want to stick with Google applications? This is the tech giant’s very own alternative and works like a charm, especially when trying to send cute turd emoji to your friends. The main feature here is the ability to search for these, as opposed to simply browsing through them. If you know what your emoji looks like, you can just type in a description and find the right icon (e.g. poop). The process takes a couple steps. Find the comma button, located towards the bottom-left area of the keyboard. Press and hold, then select the smiley face. There will then be a search option right above the emoji, if you would rather conduct a search. Download Gboard Swiftkey Swiftkey continues to be a favorite among many an Android user, mostly for its magical prediction and customization prowess, but it is also great for sending emoji. Just press and hold the enter button (bottom-right area of the keyboard) to see all your options.   Download Swiftkey Swype Swype is another very popular keyboard. And yes, it does also feature emoji support.  It is not the most convenient way to emoji, but support is there. Simply start typing something like “smile” and the respective emoji will appear in the prediction options. Keep in mind this is the only paid app in this app. It costs $0.99, but they do offer a free trial. Download Swype See also: Guess which country uses the most emoji every day? 🤔 September 10, 2016 Wrapping up You are now ready to join the emoji party!

How To Transfer Files To & From Your NVIDIA SHIELD 2017 Primetime: Google’s Five Messaging Apps May Be Too Much Choice January 27, 2017 - Written By David Steele This week, Google updated the Google Voice application and service. Along with the improvements to the interface, the company has bolstered the application’s ability to send and receive messages. In essence, they’ve added another application to their portfolio of messaging apps: including Google Voice, there are now five such applications for customers to choose from. Each of these applications offers a different perspective and many customers find themselves using two or more, especially as most are not directly compatible with one another. Let’s take a look at these five applications available for Google customers as published by Google. The first application is Google Hangouts, which is probably Google’s most popular instant messaging client and has the broadest of feature sets. Hangouts was born from Google Talk, or GTalk, and allows customers to send and receive instant messages, images and videos to and from multiple platforms, including smartphone, tablet, Chromebooks, and desktop or laptop operating systems. Google Hangouts is built into the Gmail web browser interface. As well as instant messages, Google customers can also call one another using the Hangouts application for either a voice call or a video call, where it includes built-in conferencing features. The application can also be used to call numbers and most calls to US or Canadian numbers are free. Furthermore, the Google Hangouts application on a smartphone also allows customers to send and receive SMS and MMS messages although the application is not as elegant or optimized as Google’s dedicated SMS Messenger application. Google is improving the Hangouts application with a definite bias towards the enterprise or corporate market. The next application is Google Voice, which though based around making and receiving voice calls, contains functional text messaging and the ability to share photographs. Google Voice is great for customers who switch between different devices and carrier numbers but want to use the one contact number, and also offers a handy web interface. Google’s Messenger application for the Android platform is the next one to consider, which is simply a high performance SMS and MMS client. Messenger includes the very basic ability to call the number you are messaging, but for this it uses the Android dialer application. Otherwise, the application has the basics covered: it’s for sending and receiving text messages. The next two Google instant messenger applications to use are Google Allo and Google Duo, which were introduced in 2016. Google Allo is an instant messenger application that is incompatible with Google Hangouts and available for the Android and iPhone platforms. In addition to a thoroughly modern user interface, Allo also offers something unique: currently, Allo is the only way to communicate with the Google Assistant via a text chat service. The Google Assistant is an artificially intelligent computer that can answer in-context questions or serve up Google search engine results in a more human-like manner, such as answering what’s on at a local theater, sports team results, weather updates and more. Google Allo uses a ‘phone number to find other contacts but does not rely on this in order to send or receive messages. The ability to chat with the Google Assistant is a neat little feature that some users will find useful. Around and about the same time Google released the Google Allo application, the company also launched the Google Duo application. This application is designed for video calling between either Android or iPhone devices. It too needs a ‘phone number in order to find another person, but relies on a data connection to communicate with the other party. And as with Google Allo, Google Duo is incompatible with the Google Hangouts service (in this case, video calling). Furthermore, customers cannot video call the Google Assistant to ask questions, meaning it is an application with one function. Google Duo has steadily been improved since launch in order to improve video quality, especially when video calling over a mobile data network, and the quality of video calling is superior to that of Google Hangouts. However, although Google Allo and Google Duo are considered cousins, their services are different and incompatible. Instant messages are one of the more ubiquitous applications installed onto a smartphone and for many people, is the easiest way to reach somebody. Google’s five services seemingly cover all available bases, but with several being incompatible with one another, this means that we could potentially need to install three or four applications onto our devices to use the best of Google’s offerings. For example, Google Duo offers great video calling quality but only between two people and only from a smartphone: for a three or more way conversation, we need to use Google Hangouts. For a time, Google seemed to be encouraging customers to use the Google Hangouts application as it offered almost everything a customer could want – text messages, video calling, instant messages and is available on the tablet, laptop and desktop platforms too. However, Hangouts’ newer and more glamorous cousins in the shape of Google Allo and Google Duo are incompatible with the Hangouts service and are unavailable on anything other than a mobile platform. Google has announced plans to improve Hangouts, for example it bought specialist video conferencing audio company Limes Audio and has stated it is to use this technology to improve Hangouts’ sound quality. It’s a shame that Google hasn’t added Google Duo’s ability to message the Google Assistant to Google Hangouts, or included the video calling software from Google Duo into Google Hangouts. Perhaps the company has plans to incorporate these technologies into Hangouts at some point in the future, but currently this does not look likely.

It’s a big part of the YouTube experience. You’ll see us work hard to make these partnerships deeper and bring more content to our users.”   The question comes up about three months after reports surfaced that YouTube had signed up CBS for a coming OTT-TV service to be called YouTube Unplugged. At the time, industry sources confirmed that YouTube and CBS had struck a deal and that YouTube was holding similar talks with other networks, including Fox and ABC.   RELATED: YouTube Signs CBS to OTT Service   In the meantime, YouTube continues to forge relationships with networks and tie-ins to individual shows like The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  Of recent note, YouTube and Syfy collaborated on a video campaign focused on driving awareness around the season two premiere of The Magicians.   “We will continue to invest that way and drive the premium content there,” Pichai said.   Google was also tight-lipped about subscriber numbers for YouTube Red, the $9.99 per month service launched in the fall of 2015. In November 2016, The Verge reported that YouTube Red had about 1.5 million paying subs as of “late summer,” and about 1 million who were trialing the service for free.   RELATED: Report: YouTube Red Has About 1.5M Paying Subs   “We’re pleased with the early success” of YouTube Red, Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said, noting that the subscription service has been launched in five countries. “It’s still early days. It takes a while to build a subscription business here.”   “We are seeing tractions with the rate of sign  ups,” Pichai said, adding that the plan is to launch YouTube Red in more countries and to fuel it with more original content.   Alphabet’s results also offered an update on Other Bets, the unit tied to early-stage “moonshot” projects like Google Fiber and self-driving cars.   For full-year 2016, Other Bets generated revenues of $809 million, up 82%, driven primary by Nest,  Google Fiber and Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences), and an operating loss of $3.6 billion, widened by 4%.   Regarding progress among Other Bets businesses Verily just netted a $800 million investment from Singapore-based investment company Temasek, and Waymo, Google’s self-driving car unit, recently “graduated” to a stand-alone business within Other Bets because it achieved the required thresholds toward a path to commercialization, including the recent intro of the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan.   Other Bets pulled in Q4 revenues of $262 million, versus $150 million in the year-ago quarter, and a loss of $1.08 billion, narrowed from $1.21 billion.   Porat touted Nest’s performance during the recent holiday season, as sales of key products more than doubled over the two weeks that included Black Friday and Cyber Monday.   RELATED: Marwan Fawaz Named CEO of Nest   No new detail was shared on Google Fiber, which has temporarily halted expansion plans in “potential” markets as it refines its deployment and technology approaches and continues its pursuit of wireless alternatives.   RELATED: Google Fiber Pauses Expansion Plans  Want to read more stories like this?

ByNatalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 26, 2017 -- 21:23 GMT (13:23 PST) | Topic: Cloud Image: Google Google parent company Alphabet reported mixed Q4 financial results despite solid growth in mobile search and ad sales. What's Hot on ZDnet Microsoft's multi-pronged robotics play takes shape Trump aides' use of encrypted messaging may violate records law ​Ex top Mozilla dev: Ditch all antivirus except Microsoft's Defender Students team aims to brew beer on the moon The tech giant reported a net income of $5.3 billion, or $7.56 per share. Non-GAAP earnings were $9.36 per share on a revenue of $26.1 billion, up 22 percent year-over-year, when including traffic acquisition costs (TAC). Wall Street was looking for earnings of $9.67 per share with $25.3 billion in revenue. Net revenue excluding TAC was expected to be $25.18 billion. Alphabet delivered $21.25 billion in revenue excluding TAC. Google revenues counted for most of Q4 sales with $25.8 billion in revenue, up from $22.3 billion the previous quarter. The Google umbrella covers the company's enterprise cloud, software and data management products. On the earnings webcast, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said 2016 was the year that AI and intelligent computing became "central to who we are as a company and the products that we built." "We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, Maps, messaging and Google Play," he added. Google doesn't break out sales numbers for its hardware, but in Q4 the tech giant released two major product lines: the Pixel phone and Google Home. Pichai said he was "thrilled" with the reception of the new products and that the company is committed to expanding its hardware offerings for the long term. Advertising remains a steady revenue source for Alphabet. The company's total advertising revenue was up 17 percent to $22.4 billion. Aggregate cost-per-click fell 15 percent, but aggregate paid clicks were up 36 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago. In the Other Bets category, which houses Nest and Fiber, Alphabet's healthcare-driven initiatives and other speculative projects or 'moonshots,' Alphabet posted revenue of $262 million over the quarter, with operating losses reaching $1.1 billion. Last quarter, losses in this category totaled $865 million. "Our growth in the fourth quarter ... was led by mobile search and YouTube," said Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat, in prepared remarks. "We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets." Looking forward toward the first quarter, Wall Street is expecting non-GAAP earnings of $9.34 per share with $23.71 billion in revenue.

With a new update, Google Chrome is hoping to put your mind more at ease by alerting you when the website asking for your payment information is unsecure. According to Engadget, Chrome will now display a red “not secure” warning message in the browser’s address bar when an unsecure page—which Google defines as any site that does not have an HTTPS designation—prompts you to enter your info. This update is a visual reminder that you should only give personal info to sites that begin with HTTPS , which is more secure than the common HTTP. A second Chrome update (version 56), announced on January 26, makes it so your web pages refresh faster. There are usually two reasons you would refresh a web page, Google software engineer Takashi Toyoshima wrote on the Chromium Blog. One is because a page is unresponsive, and the second is because you want to see fresh content on the page. While the new update addresses both concerns, it was created with the second in mind. Here's how it works: Every time you visit a webpage, Chrome launches hundreds of network requests to connect your browser to the website’s servers. And when you reload or refresh the site, this process of requesting access starts over again (this process is called "validation"). With the new update, Chrome only validates the main resource and data that it believes may have been changed or updated between visits. Therefore, you can see fresh information without revalidating the entire page. According to Facebook, which has a vested interest in its webpages refreshing faster, the new Chrome update allows Facebook pages to refresh 28 percent faster than before. Happy browsing!

Google planning AI tools for Pi makers this year Posted Jan 25, 2017 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is joining the Starbucks board Google is intending to expand the dev tools available to makers using the Raspberry Pi microprocessor to power their projects this year — potentially offering software tools for face- and emotion-recognition, speech-to-text translation, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, predictive analytics and more. The company is currently running a survey for Pi makers asking about the sorts of tools they would like it to develop. You can access the survey via the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s website. “We at Google are interested in creating smart tools for Makers, and want to hear from you about what would be most helpful,” it says in this survey. Tech areas that can be selected during the survey include home automation, drones, IoT, robotics, 3D printing, wearables and machine learning — so the company is casting a pretty wide net here. We’ve reached out to Google and the Pi Foundation with questions and will update this post with any response. Update: Pi co-founder Eben Upton tells TechCrunch: “For me, the big opportunities are around deep learning and AI. Google are very strong in this area, particularly after the DeepMind acquisition, and there are obvious benefits to being able to connect their services to the real world using Raspberry Pi. It will be interesting to see the outcome of the survey, and what they choose to develop in response.” The UK-based not-for-profit Pi Foundation has been wildly successful with its low cost microprocessors, passing more than 10 million sales back in September — four and a half years after its initial release, when it had expected to sell just a few thousand over the lifetime of the board. There are a wealth of existing dev tools for Pi makers to make use of, and ways to tap into — for example — the OpenCV computer vision library to build projects utilizing facial recognition. But Google bringing a set of its own AI tools to the platform could accelerate development on that front by enabling Pi users to more easily tap into, for example, the TensorFlow machine learning open source library which was originally developed by researchers at the company. Google has had a long term interest in the Pi, gifting $1M worth of the microprocessors to 15,000 UK schoolkids back in 2013, for example, via its philanthropic arm — with its ongoing business needs obviously aligning with the Foundation’s core mission to encourage more youngsters to take up coding. It’s also previously developed an open source tool for turning a Pi into a basic web server. And Google’s Android Things IoT platform includes support for the Pi 3, the current most powerful Pi. And while there is currently no official version of Android for the Pi, although there are ways to run the platform on Pi hardware (albeit with some limitations), there are signs Google is working on the real deal there too. On this prospect, Upton adds: “No news on ‘official’ Android at present: we remain very focused on PIXEL and Raspbian as our in-house software platform.” A Google spokesperson said the company does not have any specific details to share regarding its plans for Pi dev tools at this point, adding: “We’re excited to keep sharing more open source machine learning tools with the community — stay tuned for more this year.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

The company's costs also ticked higher, as it invested in talent and the core business. Revenue topped expectations, led by YouTube and mobile search, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a statement. But a Google representative told CNBC that YouTube has been slower to pick up the slack from Google's other advertising properties.

Shares fell about 3 percent in after-hours trading. Cost of revenues rose from a year ago to 41 percent of revenues, up from 38 percent a year ago. The company's traffic acquisition costs hit $4.8 billion during the quarter, up from a year ago and higher than the $4.7 billion expected by a StreetAccount estimate. Alphabet also reporting a tax-charge related to stock-based compensation of $586 million, higher than the $316 million a year ago. Google's costs-per-click — the amount it gets from advertisers— fell 16 percent year over year, more than the 11 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates. "The core of Alphabet's business is still about both Google's search and YouTube's revenues," Forrester analyst Thomas Husson told CNBC in a statement. "The majority of these revenues derive from mobile, and the lower cost-per-click here should be compensated by a higher volume. I'd argue that the stability of Google's revenue in the next two to three years will depend on their ability to maintain the growth of mobile revenues. While there might be slower growth, the mid-term prospect looks good given the fact that advertisers will wake up to the mobile Web opportunity after having focused too much on mobile apps." The results hinge on Google's new advertising formats, like promoted pins in Maps, and progress monetizing YouTube. Investors will listen closely to the quarterly conference call for any signs that YouTube, like rival Facebook, is closing in on the maximum number of ads its customers will tolerate. Google did not share specifics on the holiday season sales of the new Pixel phone and Google Home, its competitor to Amazon's Echo. Neil Doshi, managing director at Mizuho Securities, estimated that Google sold about 1 million Pixels during the quarter. CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that the company was thrilled with the reception of the Pixel, and that the Google Home was a very popular present for the holidays. Earnings are also a chance for chief financial officer Ruth Porat to share progress on reigning in the company's "other bets" category, which includes Nest home automation products, venture investments and self-driving car technology (recently renamed Waymo). The company reported "other bets" revenue of $262 million for the fourth quarter, much higher than the $150 million in the year ago period. The operating loss also narrowed from a year ago: In the fourth quarter, it was a loss of $1.088 billion, compared to a loss of $1.213 billion a year ago. Porat said that Waymo is ontinuing to drive down hardware costs, while sales of Nest's key products more than doubled over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Porat said. Wall Street has lauded the financial discipline, transparency and shareholder return of the Alphabet structure, even if the company has lost key staffers in the process. Shares of Alphabet hit an all-time intra-day high of $861 a share on Thursday, as the broader markets hit record levels.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File) Posted By: Gerard Taylor 28. January 2017 Denmark will become the first country in the world to appoint a digital ambassador to manage its relationship with technology giants such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. According to the Danish newspaper, Politiken, the development has become necessary because companies are now so large, both in their economic strength and the influence they have on people’s everyday lives, that they surpass many of the countries where Denmark has its traditional embassies. ‘These companies have become a form of ‘new nation’, and we have to deal with that’, said Anders Samuelsen of the Liberal Alliance party. Apple and Google are almost large enough to enter the club of the world’s top 20 major economies, the so-called ‘G20’, if they were nations. ‘We will, of course, stick to the old way of thinking, where we protect our relations with other countries. But we are bound to have close relationships with some of the companies that affect us’, said the Foreign Minister. This is not a new development, as the world already saw the rise and fall of the British East India Company between 1600 and 1874, and the Dutch West India Company between 1602 and 1674.   Source: NTB scanpix / Norway Today Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Related SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Related Articles News Woman and daughters found dead in freezer in Denmark News All circumcisions carried out in Denmark are to be registered News Pregnant woman killed in park in Denmark Finance Elkjøp increases its number of stores in Denmark Be the first to comment on "Denmark to appoint world’s first ‘digital ambassador’" Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Image: Yubico By Freia Lobo2017-01-27 02:24:27 UTC When the rollout of its newest privacy tools, Facebook snuck in a very useful update: support for physical security keys. That means you can now use any USB key that supports the universal second factor (U2F) standard to log into your Facebook account, confirming your identity just by tapping the key. SEE ALSO: Facebook changes how it talks about privacy What does this mean? You can now use a physical key to log into your Facebook account just like you'd use a key to start a car. You'll still need to use the key in combination with your password (so if a person steals it, they won't be able to log in). You can even use a key to log into Facebook via Chrome on Android, that is, assuming both your phone and key have NFC wireless tech. "Using your phone for two-factor authentication works well for a lot of people, and it's way more secure than using just your password." Facebook said in a comment from the Facebook Security page. "Security keys offer certain advantages, though, and we wanted to offer people the option." What is a security key anyway? A security key is a USB-based hardware key that functions as the second "factor" in two-factor authentication. Once you log into a service that supports they key, all you need to do is insert the key into a port and tap it to complete your login — no SMS or Google Authenticator codes required. Keys typically support several security features and standards, like one-time passwords, public key encryption and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). Image: yubikey In case you're unfamiliar: two-factor authentication is a method of confirming a user's identity by utilizing two different components. Two different types of information are used. Something you know, like a password, and something you have, like a physical key. A simple example is an ATM. To withdraw money, you need something you have, the bank card, and something you know, a PIN number. This protects you in situations where either your PIN or card is stolen. Why do I need one?  While two-factor authentication via SMS is gaining popularity, many experts prefer security keys especially for desktop and laptops, which most people use in the workplace.  As compared to other forms of authentication, security keys are faster, can be used on a number of different services like Facebook, Google and Dropbox, and are nearly immune to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. The keys currently only work on the latest versions of Chrome and Opera, the browsers that support U2F. Another benefit of shifting to a physical security system is that it lays the groundwork for eliminating passwords entirely. In addition to the security key, companies like Google have previously tested other forms of physical security, including using a ring.  In a Wall Street Journal op-ed last year, President Obama encouraged more Americans to “move beyond passwords” and add an extra layer of security to their accounts. Particularly over the last few years, password theft of large organizations like Target, Time Warner and several banks have left hundreds of millions of accounts compromised. While multi-factor authentication has existed for many years to protect against password theft, in the form of security questions, PIN codes and more, the methods vary greatly in quality, and some of them can be compromised by social engineering. The most easily available security key is the Yubikey by Yubico. Its simplest key retails for $18. Image: facebook Facebook adding U2F support is an important step in pushing forward the adoption of physical security keys, and potentially making millions of Facebook accounts more secure. Facebook itself has nearly 1.8 billion users and its other services have hundreds of millions as well. While security keys may not be popular yet, with support from massively popular services like Facebook and Gmail, they soon could be.

Tips and tricks for protecting your data in 2017 by Joe Roberts 1 hour ago 0 shares Read Comments Data Privacy Day 2017: What is Data Privacy Day and why should you care? Our guide takes a look at why data privacy – or data protection, as it's sometimes known in Europe – gets a dedicated moment in the sun all over the world, and how big companies like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have struggled to protect their users in the past. It's Data Privacy Day – a time when the world stops to contemplate the immense importance of keeping our personal information safe from nefarious elements. These include hackers, snooping government agencies, nosy social networks, your boss, your mum, and your partner. The only thing not trying to pry into your data coffers is your cat – but even Tiddles would probably be willing to flog it for a bit of catnip. The fact there's now a whole day dedicated to data privacy means that it's about more than just making sure your Facebook privacy settings are correctly tuned, right? Allow us to explain... Related: MWC 2017 What is Data Privacy Day? Tips and tricks to protect your private data online Data Privacy Day was established to raise awareness about the importance of keeping sensitive information safe in an age where such a thing is in high demand. It all started in 2007, when the Council of Europe decided to hold European Data Protection Day. It then made its way to the States in 2009, when the US House of Representatives passed House Resolution HR 31, declaring January 28 "National Data Privacy Day". Now, the event is observed in Canada, India, and 47 European countries, making it a pretty big deal. Wikipedia even dubs it an "international holiday", which we'll care about in 2019 when it could mean an extra day off work. Related: How to become anonymous online The Online Trust Alliance (OTA) and other groups began to support Data Privacy Day as Data Privacy & Protection Day in 2009. Taking place annually on January 28, Data Protection Day as it's referred to internationally, is, according to the Online Trust Alliance, designed to recognise "the importance of data protection and adoption of responsible privacy practices." The National Cyber Security Alliance's Stay Safe Online site states: "Data Protection Day commemorates the Jan. 28, 1981, signing of Convention 108, the first legally binding international treaty dealing with privacy and data protection." In the spirit of helping spread awareness, here are some brief guides to keeping your own information safe on popular sites and services. Data Privacy Day: How to protect your privacy on Facebook Looking to make sure those less than flattering pictures from Friday night don't make it into the public sphere? You had better make sure your Facebook privacy settings are in order. Here's a quick explainer. You can do a quick "health check" of your overall privacy settings by tapping the padlock to the right of the Home screen and selecting Run Privacy Check Up. This will allow you see privacy settings at a glance over three key areas of Facebook: Posts, Apps, Profile. And when it comes to specific posts, whenever you upload a photo, fill in a status, or check in at a location there’s the opportunity to customise who you wish to share with. You can also adjust this by clicking the padlock and selecting: "Who can see my stuff?" You may well be looking to hide your personal information, seeing as Facebook now collects a shedload of it. That includes your email address, your birthday, political views, phone number, where you’ve studied, your sexual orientation, where you’re from, where you’ve worked, who you’re married to, who you’re related to and more. The scope of information potentially publicly available is genuinely staggering. Thankfully, much of this can be controlled via the Privacy Check Up mentioned above. You can alter who sees what by heading to the About section of your profile and selecting Edit under each section. Altering privacy settings from Friends to Only Me will hide the information from your profile. In many cases you may want to remove it completely by clicking the 'X'.

Related: 18 Facebook privacy setting tweaks you should make right now Data Privacy Day: How to protect your privacy on Windows 10 Microsoft is set to introduce an online privacy dashboard with the upcoming Creators Update, due to launch in April this year. This portal will allow users to see activity data such as location, search, browsing, and Cortana Notebook data across multiple Microsoft services. As Windows chief Terry Myerson explains in a blog post: "When you are signed in with your Microsoft account, you can go to account.microsoft.com/privacy to review and clear data such as browsing history, search history, location activity, and Cortana’s Notebook – all in one place. Related: The worst Windows 10 problems – and how to quickly fix them Alongside the portal, Microsoft is simplifying the privacy settings in Windows 10, reducing the number of diagnostic data collection levels from three to two. That basically means you'll be able to choose between Basic and Full data collection levels, which is certainly more simple but seems a tad limited, especially seeing as the Basic level will now collect even less data than before. For now, Windows 10 users can click Start then head to Settings>Privacy. This opens a list of general privacy options with links to specific privacy settings on the left of the page. Some specific settings you may want to tweak include file-sharing updates, which lets you download updates from other Windows 10 computers. Of course, your own computer is also used to share updates with other Windows 10 computers, so to turn this setting off, which is on by default, go to Settings>Update & security>Advanced options>Choose how updates are delivered. It's also worth taking a look at Cortana's privacy settings. The digital assistant gets to know you as you use it, but to stop Cortana collecting your data go to Settings>Privacy>Speech, inking, & typing and click 'Stop getting to know me'. Data Privacy Day: How to protect your privacy on WhatsApp By default, WhatsApp makes it so that any user can view your Read Receipts, last seen, profile photo and status. To change these settings on Android and iOS, hit the Menu Button from the main screen and go to Settings>Account>Privacy. Related: Best free anti-virus You can set last seen, profile photo, and/or status to one of three settings: Everyone, My Contacts, or Nobody. 'Everyone' means your last seen, profile photo and/or status will be available to all WhatsApp users. 'My Contacts' means your last seen, profile photo and/or status will be available to your contacts from your address book only. 'Nobody' means your last seen, profile photo and/or status will not be available to anyone. If you uncheck Read Receipts, other users won't be able to see when you've read their messages, but you will also not be able to see when they've read yours. You can also block specific users by tapping the Menu Button and going to Settings>Account>Privacy>Blocked contacts. From here you can tap the + icon to add new numbers to your blocked list. WhatsApp has specific privacy pages for lesser known operating systems here: Windows Phone | Nokia S40 | BlackBerry | Nokia S60 | BlackBerry 10 Data Privacy Day: How to protect your privacy on Google Google collects a vast amount of data but is generally pretty good at being transparent about it and letting you choose exactly what information is being stored. In fact, there's a whole 'Privacy Checkup' page dedicated to letting you choose the privacy settings you want applied across your profile. As Google puts it: "Review and adjust what data Google uses to personalize your experience, and update what information you share with friends or make public." Related: Best VPN That's the quickest way to get an overview of how data is stored across Google services such as Google Photos and Google+ etc. If you want more information about how Google collects data and what type of information it's storing, head over to the dedicated Privacy site for a full rundown, complete with friendly-looking cartoons to ease your anxiety. And finally, Google recently introduced the new My Account page, which "gives you quick access to settings and tools that let you safeguard your data, protect your privacy, and decide how your information can make Google services work better for you." It's basically a hub which stores all your activity and data across devices and keeps it in one place. Pretty creepy but also useful if you want a full picture of just what Google is keeping tabs on. Plus, don't forget that Google also offers you the 'Right to be Forgotten' from its search results in Europe. You can either fill out this form and send it direct to Big G, or use a third-party tool like Forget.me to streamline the whole process. Other sites, namely Deseat.me, offer similar services, but promise to delete everything about you linked to your Google account. Which, frankly, is everything these days.

SEO is also defined as the process of making changes that improve the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine’s results. In my previous posts, “An In-depth Guide To Search Engine Optimization (SEO)”  and “3 Tips To Know How To Hire A Good SEO Company,” I have explained what SEO is all about. However, today I will be discussing the top benefits of SEO for promoting your content. Many people are only interested in SEO because they have heard everybody talking about it but know nothing about the benefits. Certainly, one of the reasons you should consider SEO is that your competitors are probably using it to outsmart you. But SEO will also directly benefit your business in many ways. SEO has become widely used as an online web marketing strategy because of its success. While the great things about SEO are vast, here are just some of the benefits. Increase Brand Credibility Certainly, one of the reasons many bloggers and site owners decide to invest in SEO is because they want to increase traffic to their site. Having a blog with many followers or a popular site with a high Google ranking will also increase your name recognition and enhance your credibility. This is as a result of the trust people place in Google. Since achieving a top position in search engine rankings will cause potential customers or readers to respect your brand more, having your website in one of the top positions translates to more exposure for your blog or website. Also, when your content appears on the first results page for your targeted keywords, not only do users associate your brand with those keywords, but they will trust you more, since companies on the first results page are generally perceived to be more trustworthy. Increase Traffic to Your Website Achieving top positions on the major search engines’ result pages will bring your website many more clicks, so ranking in these top positions can bring about significant improvements in website traffic and in revenue for your business. SEO also concentrates on creating helpful and keyword-relevant name tags and META explanations, which display in the result pages. Having improved tags and descriptions helps you to increase your click-through rate, which also promotes increases in qualified web traffic. Better Returns on Investment No doubt about it, investing in effective SEO will provide a better return on investment than running expensive ads. Investing in an SEO service is also more cost-effective than pumping your money into AdWords, PPC and others. SEO is one of the most cost-effective marketing strategies because it targets users who are actively looking for your products and services online. Because it targets your ideal customers, investing in SEO is more efficient and effective than investing in any other marketing strategy you can think of. SEO is not just for a particular type of site. No matter your niche, be it e-commerce or something else, you need trackable records and quantifiable results to determine your return on investment resulting from SEO investments. However, those in niches other than e-commerce will determine these trackable records from the lead conversions on their sites, while those running e-commerce sites will look at the various channels users take before they make a purchase (that is, the path customers take before buying anything). With this, you can calculate your SEO return on investment. After you’ve read the above points, I’m sure you can now see that there are many reasons for you to work on SEO for your content. If all the other points don’t interest you, I know that the potential for increased website traffic and for better returns on your investments will surely attract you. Identifying a Great SEO Provider A well-rounded SEO strategy requires keyword research, website content generation and optimization, backlinking and more. According to Dotcom SEO Expert, it is very important for those who outsource their SEO services to look for specific qualities in the provider they choose. The three top questions the site says you should ask are: Is the provider effective? A company with a high reputation and good qualities will have case studies available from past customers. Look over those case studies to learn how effective and efficient the company’s services are. Who is the provider? It is pertinent to know who will actually be working on your content. You need analyze the provider by looking at their past records. Taking this step will save you from hiring a poorly-performing company for your service. Look at several companies so that you can choose the best and most reputable one.  What type of reporting is available? A good SEO company will offer reports that prove their services are worth the money. Look over the analytics and ranking reports to be sure. A firm without such reports may not be a trustworthy one. These reports lend credibility to a company. Conclusion In conclusion, SEO is a mighty tool for content marketing and for helping customers find you online, no matter what type of business or website you run. However, there are still some mistakes you must avoid. Here are some of the SEO mistakes you should be sure to avoid: Over-usage of keywords Non-keyword-focused content Duplicate content Grammatical or spelling errors Links from non-credible sources Featured photo credit: Pexels via pexels.com Love this article?

Virginia Raggi, 38, of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, is being probed for abuse of office and false testimony. She said on Facebook that she had received a subpoena related to the nomination as city tourism boss of Renato Marra, the brother of her jailed former aide Raffaele Marra. Renato Marra was later removed from the position. “I’m very serene and I have full confidence in the judiciary, as always,” she wrote. Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi receives a summons from city prosecutors over a staff appointment https://t.co/uPOjn6ypNM pic.twitter.com/vIjCCmRSkc— Bloomberg (@business) 25 janvier 2017 Raggi’s woes have made headlines in Italy where 5-Star, the country’s largest opposition group, presents itself as squeaky-clean, compared to traditional parties, which have been dogged by corruption for decades. Raffaele Marra, former head of personnel at city hall, was arrested in December on suspicion of corruption linked to a real estate deal in 2013. He denies any wrongdoing. Raggi was elected by a landslide last year after pledging to crack down on rampant corruption. But almost from the start her administration was beset by problems. Nonetheless, opinion polls suggest 5-Star might beat the ruling centre-left Democratic Party (PD) at Italy’s next general election, which is due by early 2018. with Reuters Share this article: More about: Corruption Rome Inquiry Court Italian politics Italy Page 1 Copy 34 All views Get a different perspective Every story can be told in many ways: see the perspectives from Euronews journalists in our other language teams.

The tech companies have been speaking up since the last eight months about the NSLs “that came with gag orders that prevented Twitter from telling the public or the targeted users about the government’s demands in two letters it received in 2015 and 2016”, Tech Crunch reported. The FBI recently lifted these gag orders, allowing Twitter to acknowledge the NSLs for the first time. In the newly published NSLs, the FBI asked Twitter to turn over “the name, address, length of service, and electronic communications transactional records” of two users. The micro-blogging site said it gave a “very limited set of data” in response to the requests and demanded more freedom in keeping their point. “Twitter remains unsatisfied with restrictions on our right to speak more freely about national security requests we may receive, Twitter associate general counsel Elizabeth Banker wrote in a blog post. “We would like a meaningful opportunity to challenge government restrictions when ‘classification’ prevents speech on issues of public importance,” Banker added. Twitter has already disclosed these two letters and informed the targeted users and is suing the Department of Justice in an effort to speak more publicly about secret requests for user data.

It was a minor bump in specifications from the previous OnePlus 3 and offered a better processor, higher storage capacity, improved front-facing camera, and bigger battery. With its larger battery in tow, OnePlus has released a video showing off its charging prowess against Google's Pixel XL. In this battle, OnePlus shows off its Dash Charge versus Google's fast charging - while both devices are under a heavy load using navigation. After a quick 30 minute drive around the city, OnePlus comes out the victor by being able to charge up to 57%, while Google's Pixel XL only made it to 19%. It's good to see OnePlus' Dash Charge solution perform well under high load like GPS, but since it is a proprietary technology, you will need to make sure to not only have a compatible charger, but also a compatible cable. It might not be as convenient as walking into your local electronics store, but OnePlus does offer its car charger on the OnePlus online shop for $29.95. If you're looking to purchase an extra cable, you'll be able to pick up a secondary one for $14.95.

"We would like a meaningful opportunity to challenge government restrictions when 'classification' prevents speech on issues of public importance," Banker added. Twitter has already disclosed these two letters and informed the targeted users and is suing the Department of Justice in an effort to speak more publicly about secret requests for user data. --IANS sku/sm/bg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Turns out that people really, really love emoji. Marketing firm Emogi calculates that more than 2 trillion messages incorporating one of the colorful characters were sent by smartphone users in 2016 alone. Marketers used 775 percent more emoji in 2016 than the prior year. There’s an emoji search engine, touch bar, and even feature film. So perhaps it’s not all that surprising that apps with emoji in their description attract more downloads than those with plain old text. That’s according to app developer Novoda, which conducted a study using Google’s Developer Console. It tracked the performance of three different app listings in the Google Play Store, three of which had emojis at the end of the description: a rocket ship, a humanoid holding waste over a recycling bin, and a double-underlined one hundred. A fourth listing — a control group — didn’t have any. Novada exposed 25 percent of Google Play Store users to the emoji-fied descriptions and 25 percent to plain text. More: Google’s experimental new feature lets you search with emojis via Twitter The results were surprising. In Germany and Italy, the “rocket” emoji and “100” emoji boosted downloads by a whopping 20 percent compared to the control group. Users in Poland, meanwhile, showed a clear preference for the “recycling” emoji — downloads did 7 percent better with it than without. The data from other countries wasn’t as clear-cut. Would-be downloaders in Russia, France, Spain didn’t appear to prefer any one emoji over the other. And U.S.-based users preferred the description without the emoji over the emoji-fied listings. More: Apple and Microsoft put the kibosh on a proposed rifle emoji The breakdown likely has something to do with cultural differences. According to a Swiftkey study published last year, countries like Canada were found to use the greatest number of “raunchy” emojis (money, violent, and sports emojis), while France used four times as many “heart” emojis than other countries. Brazil, meanwhile, used more than double the amount of religious emojis (prayer hands, church, star in night sky) than the average. Australia used clothing emoji at nearly twice the average rate. And users in Arab countries were more than four times as likely to use the “flower” and “plant” emojis. The takeaway, Novado said, was that tailored app listings perform better than generic ones. Apps with emojis did 4.5 percent better on average than those without. “[Optimization] has real and measurable effects on [developer’s] revenue,” it said. “Localize your tests to get better results.” One thing’s for sure: Emojis aren’t going away anytime soon. The world’s approximately 2 billion smartphone users send six billion emoji each day. Fully 92 percent of internet users employ emoji in everyday conversation, one-third of them daily. And nearly half of all posts on pic-sharing network Instagram contain an emoji of one form or another. Also watch: Share

Nvidia said on Thursday that owners of the original Shield TV set-top box can now download Software Upgrade v5.0. The update adds everything found on the latest Shield TV (2017) unit launched in early January, such as support for Nest cameras, 4K HDR content via Amazon Video, and more. The platform update also brings the older Shield TV unit up to speed with an upgrade to Android 7.0 Nougat. First up to bat is support for the new Nvidia Games app, which replaces the Shield Hub and its associated links. That said, exclusive Android games, GeForce Now, and GameStream games are thrown into one application for a more centralized feel. All other games installed on the set-top box will be shoved into the games row on the home screen. “This update will be a staged rollout and will happen over the next few weeks via app update on the Google Play Store,” Nvidia says. More: Nvidia improves ‘Resident Evil 7,’ more with latest GeForce drivers On the Android 7.0 front, Shield TV (2015) owners will benefit from several enhanced features provided by the upgrade including a new settings menu that’s provided vertically on the right side of the screen. Android 7.0 also adds picture-in-picture support in apps like Live Channels and provides a recent apps page accessible by double-pressing the home button. Here are additional features provided with the Shield TV 2015 update: 4K HDR streaming video support in Amazon Video, Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies, and VUDU Direct access to Steam Big Picture in the Nvidia Games App Support for 4K HDR streaming in Nvidia GameStream Nest Aware support through the new Nest app New apps: NFL, Twitter for TV, Comedy Central, Vimeo, and Viki Cast support for HBO GO 1, 6.1, and 8.1 speaker configurations for Plex USB and SD card storage support Pause and Play functionality on the Shield remote Nvidia said support for Google Assistant will come to the Shield TV (2015) unit soon. However, this feature will require the new $50 Shield Remote to take advantage of Google Assistant on the older set-top box. The peripheral includes an internal microphone built for voice-based commands and searches, providing a hands-free experience when looking for games or other content. The 2015 Shield TV model will soon receive support for SmartThings Hub technology, allowing owners to turn the device into a smart home hub. It will also be compatible with Nvidia Spot, the company’s upcoming microphone/speaker hybrid based on Google Assistant. The Shield TV unit will play as the central hub while Spot units can be placed throughout the home (or office) at $50 apiece. For customers who have yet to purchase a Shield TV set-top box, the 2017 model is available now in “vanilla” ($200) and “pro” ($300) versions. The vanilla model only has 16GB of internal storage while the pro unit includes 500GB of storage, but both are bundled with a controller and a remote. Owners of the vanilla unit can expand the storage by connecting an external drive to the USB 3.0 port. Also watch: Share

explores social media on his mobile device as he sits at a cafe in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 24, 2016. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser Friday, Jan 27, 2017 Dubai: Gulf consumers have an overwhelming closeness to social and media platforms — with WhatsApp topping as the must-have brand — while their global counterparts still show some empathy for brick-and-mortar. A new survey by the authoritative branding consultancy Siegel+Gale shows WhatsApp a clear leader of the pack, and ahead of YouTube (a perennial favourite with the youth in the region), Google (its map and search engine among them), Samsung (despite the Note 7 fiasco) and Facebook. And the prime reason why these brands were chosen over others is because of the ease of access they offered users. “The message has never been simpler — 84 per cent of consumers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia are willing to pay more for a simpler experience,” said Zouheir Zoueihed, Managing Director — Middle East. “Brands that want to standout and succeed must align to simplicity and make sure they deliver on it. It is a key in order to rise above competition and escape pressure on pricing.” Advertisement In WhatsApp’s case, which is owned by Facebook, it sure seems to be the case — 93 per cent are daily users of the app in the region, and is the “mobile app they would not be able to do without”. “It leads the direct messaging revolution, crossing generational divides and exhibiting robust popularity among all age groups, which is testament to its simplicity and ease of use,” the brand consultancy reports. For Amazon, constantly in market speculation of an impending big-bang entry into this market, there are good tidings to be had from the report. It’s up 52 spots — “The simplicity of a broad selection of products, customer reviews to help make a choice and a free shipping option if something catches your eye all remove friction from the customer journey,” states the report. “Whereas it is taken for granted in internet search, customer-centric simplicity is more differentiating in retail, helping it to dominate traditional competitors. “As Amazon expands from e-commerce into hardware, software, services and beyond the brand risks confusing consumers — but it also has more opportunities to add value to our everyday lives. In 2016 Amazon’s innovation was not about new ways to buy stuff or consume content, or investment in the distant future, but in directly simplifying daily life.” But one Gulf based brick-and-mortar brand Home Centre scored with respondents. “Over past two years Home Centre, the largest home retailer in the region, started to invest more than Dh1 billion as part of a five-year plan to strengthen presence across MENA and expand brand,” the report notes. “In September 2015, brand launched simple online platform with seamless checkout experience to make shopping more convenient and remodelled over 40 existing stores in region.” While the Gulf consumers are clued in on digital and social, brick-and-mortar brands do have an edge elsewhere … at least for now. Europe’s discount supermarket brands Aldi and Lidl were named tops in the global rankings and ahead of Google and Netflix, while another brick-and-mortar name — Ikea — comes in fifth. For Aldi, the keep it simple message has been working consistently well — this is the fourth year running it tops the Siegel+Gale listings. Also in the global Top 10 rankings were Amazon, KFC, YouTube, McDonald’s and Subway. In fact, the top 15 positions see a number of quick-service global F&B chains, implying that “quick service often means simple service”, which is how their patrons want to be served. But for some brands, declines beckoned — Yahoo, in the midst of a corporate acquisition and name changes, dropped 37 places. And French insurer AXA was rated “as the most complex brand for the second year running”. But Unilever-owned Dollar Shave Club landed in the top 10 “US Disrupter” rankings, as did Jet.com, the value-for-money eCommerce provider. “Disrupter brands possess a common characteristic — they place simplicity at the core of their customer experience,” said David Srere, co-CEO and chief strategy officer, Siegel+Gale. “The recent billion-dollar acquisitions of Dollar Shave Club and Jet.com are further proof that simplicity drives brand loyalty and financial gain.” The Siegel+Gale report also gives an indication of what brands are losing out from failing the “keep it simple” message — a whopping 70 billion pounds. “Complexity is fast becoming the silent killer of profitable business growth,” said Liana Dinghile, Group Strategy Director, Siegel+Gale “Brands that don’t simplify are leaving almost £70 billion on the table … hence the increasing premium placed on simplicity today.” Customers are avidly seeking experiences that make their lives simpler and the brands winning are the ones that focus their efforts on making this happen. Simplicity is definitely not easy but it does pay.” The scope of the Siegel+Gale study * Respondents rated 857 brands, selected as a representative set that respondents would be most likely to know and/or use in each country. They answered questions on how simple/complex they perceived their lives to be, how familiar they were with certain brands, if they recently used these brands and the simplicity/complexity of a brand’s communications and interactions in relation to its industry peers. * They were then given a ‘Brand/Industry Simplicity Score’ calculated using inputs such as their contribution to making life simpler/more complex, the pain of typical interactions and communications in terms of how transparent/honest they were, useful, easy to understand etc. By Manoj Nair Associate Editor Gulf News 2017. All rights reserved. © Copyright Zawya.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: Why a post-Budget fall won't mean achhe din are over for markets. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage It's goodbye China, hello virtual reality for Hugo Barra After spending three and half years in Beijing leading smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp's global division, Barra is returning to Silicon Valley to head Facebook Inc's VR efforts. He leaves behind an uneven legacy. Barra, 40, was hired in 2013 from Google, where he worked as head of product management for Android, to oversee Xiaomi's international expansion. While he helped boost device sales in India, the company aborted a push into Brazil and its other global efforts have largely stalled. At the same time, Xiaomi lost ground in its home market to domestic competitors like Vivo and Oppo, which worked more effectively with retail stores. Barra arrived with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market. "He did a lot to build up Xiaomi's mindshare internationally," said Bryan Ma, vice president for devices research at IDC in Singapore. "But when you look at the hard numbers, they show mixed results." Barra's surprise exit comes just a couple of weeks after co-founder and CEO Lei Jun said in a letter to employees that the company had recently faced "unforgettable" challenges and now needed to focus on "sustainable growth." After building its success by selling only online, it's now developing brick-and-mortar stores in China. Barra declined to comment for this story, but he cited several accomplishments in social media posts as he departed, including the expansion into India and more than 20 other markets. A spokesperson for Xiaomi said Thursday he would continue to advise the company, "for the indefinite future." When he first moved from sunny California to smoggy Beijing, Barra brought the world spotlight with him. Energetic, globe-trotting, and supremely comfortable commanding a conference-hall stage, the Brazilian-born Barra showed Xiaomi how to introduce its expanding line of products -- which include fitness bands, ear buds, and air filters -- into other countries with a fast-growing middle class. "He helped to be that ambassador to the rest of the world," said IDC's Ma. "He was that enthusiastic, charismatic guy on stage, who helped explain who this Chinese company was." From 2012 to 2015, Xiaomi's smartphone sales rose at a furious clip, expanding more than six-fold, powered by online flash sales and savvy social-media. For parts of 2014 and 2015, Xiaomi ranked first in domestic smartphone sales, and local and international media dubbed the company the Apple of China. When Barra joined, he hoped to translate that success abroad, identifying India and Brazil as key targets. The vision was promising enough that in late 2014, Xiaomi was valued at about $45 billion, the highest for any startup in the world at the time. Yet Xiaomi's position at home soon began slipping. Facing intense competition from Vivo, Oppo and other rivals, Xiaomi dropped from first to fourth among smartphone sellers in China. While it focused on online sales, its competitors worked to become more prominent in retail stores, where the vast majority of customers still buy phones. The challenges at home foreshadowed hurdles in other markets. "To replicate an e-commerce model from China in India or Indonesia is not as easy as it sounds. Every country has a different internet culture," said Edward Tse, a Hong Kong-based business consultant and author of the book "China's Disruptors," which described the early days of Xiaomi and other Chinese tech upstarts. By traveling frequently to India -- and chronicling his trips on social media -- Barra helped to build a smartphone business there with $1 billion in annual revenue, an achievement he noted in his farewell Facebook post. Xiaomi is currently ranked third in the Indian smartphone market, with 9% market share, according to Counterpoint Research. "Hugo spearheaded the idea of how you bring Xiaomi-branded products outside of China," said Gary Rieschel, founding managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Xiaomi. "He works incredibly hard." Barra thanked Lei Jun and Xiaomi's fans in his departure post on Facebook. "This journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way," he wrote, "and I can proudly say that Xiaomi Global is the first baby I helped bring into the world." Neil Shah, Counterpoint's research director in India, thinks Xiaomi's performance in India may be near peaking. "There's almost a ceiling about how much you can sell online. Sixty to seventy percent of the markets are offline," he said. For online channels, Xiaomi's margins are razor thin, in India and China alike. Chinese rival Vivo, which works closely with retail stores, has already overtaken Xiaomi in India. IDC's Ma says Xiaomi's prospects in India look positive for the next year, but after that he isn't so sure. "The story in India reflects a lot of what has been happening in China, too. As the market shifts toward offline channels, it favors Oppo and Vivo." According to IDC, India is now Xiaomi's dominant overseas market -- accounting for 62% of its non-China shipments for the first nine months of 2016. Next up is Myanmar, accounting for 16 percent of shipments. "Myanmar is not exactly the first country that comes to mind when you think of the global smartphone market," said Ma. After opening with much fanfare in the summer of 2015, Xiaomi's Brazil office closed last year. The company's position in Brazilian smartphone sales peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, with about 1% of the market, according to Tina Lu, head of Counterpoint Research for Latin America. "Everything they were selling, they were selling at a loss," she said. "Unless you assemble devices locally, you face taxes of about 60%." Xiaomi explored, but never finalized, plans to manufacture devices in Brazil. A former employee at Xiaomi's Brazil office, which once employed 23 people, said local management struggled to distinguish itself. Beyond the pricing and brand challenges, the outpost had a difficult time coordinating strategy with Beijing, the person said. Replicating Xiaomi's early success in developing economies turned out to be elusive -- with obstacles ranging from Brazil's heavy taxes on foreign-assembled devices; to patent-infringement lawsuits in India; to the slow adoption of e-commerce in most developing countries compared with China. "A lot of people, including myself, once thought that if a Chinese technology company can make it there in China, it can make it anywhere. But I got that wrong," said Clay Shirky, an associate professor at NYU Shanghai and author of the 2015 book on Xiaomi, "Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream." Now Xiaomi will turn greater attention to fighting for its home turf. In his recent letter to employers, Lei Jun admitted the company had lost focus as it attempted rapid expansion, into both new products and countries. "That's why we must slow our pace, and seriously learn from our mistakes," he wrote. Barra isn't the only executive departing amid the slowdown. In October, Chen Tong, a vice-president for content at Xiaomi, left the company to join news platform Yidianzixun. Zhang Jinling, a vice-president managing finance and investments, left to join Baidu Inc. Chen did not respond to a request for comment, and Zhang declined to comment. "They had some glory days in the past. One can never count them out," said Tse. "But for them to really come back, they need to do a lot of hard work to rebuild the brand. People in China view it now as a declining brand." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

With Google on its last Android Wear 2.0 Beta build and the launch date set to February 9, at least a couple of companies are expected to announce some new Android Wear devices.. But even before MWC, we are expecting Google and LG to both announce a couple of smartwatches made by LG which will debut the 2.0 version of Android Wear. These two watches are the LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style. The LG Watch Style is the model in question, and it has been leaked by Evan Blass on Twitter @evleaks in two different colors: Silver, and Rose Gold. LG Watch Style, in silver (top) and rose gold (bottom) pic.twitter.com/JlHaq35bZ0 Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 28, 2017 This image coincides with the leaked image of the rose gold Watch Style we saw a little over a week ago originate from TechnoBuffalo. As a reminder, the LG Watch Style is the smaller of the two, it will feature a 1.2 inch 360x360 circular P-OLED screen, 512MB of RAM, 4GB of storage, and a 240mAh battery. It will also be IP67-certified, but it wont come with the same features as the Watch Sport like NFC, GPS, mobile data, and a heart rate sensor. We hope Evan Blass has some images of the LG Watch Sport as well! What do you think of the LG Watch Style so far?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Chrome browser updated for faster reloading, less power consumption By Rei Padla - January 27, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Among other things, Google has been busy working on the Chrome browser. A new version was recently unveiled by the tech giant promising improved and faster reloading of pages. Web browsers are essential in this mobile and Internet age and people want them to become faster and more efficient than ever. The company is already testing the improvements and before we know it, page reloading is much speedier and has lesser validation requests. Performance issues are expected to be reduced or eliminated in some areas. The web platform may be changing radically the past decade but browsers remain almost the same but only snappier. Hopefully, webpages these days have fewer broken links and have very few bugs. Making the Chrome browser faster also results to less consumption of power and bandwidth. According to the Chrome browser developers, reloading is faster by 28%. Those validation requests mentioned earlier were actually mostly from Chrome going to Facebook. The latter approached the Chrome team to report the issue and so the developers really have to make some changes. Chrome promises faster reloads now. Others may not quickly notice the change but there will be improvements definitely. Here is a video showing the change in Chrome browser reloading of web pages: SOURCE: Chromium Blog Story Timeline Chrome Browser v37 now has Google's material design Scroll Anchoring in Chrome browser can be enabled Chrome browser updated, now plays smoother and faster videos Google updates Chrome Browser for Android, adds offline viewing feature TAGS Android Chrome Chrome for Android web browser Rei Padla Must Read HTC U Ultra, U Play hands-on: putting “U” at the center 15 best Android games of 2016, which means you should try these if you haven’t already Top 20 Android Apps for 2016 Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,208FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 473,138FollowersFollow 60,080SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2008 - 2017 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

It’s not strange for a large company to slash jobs, but this round has a high-visibility casualty: Bryan Roper, who’s well known for his boisterous demos at Microsoft press conferences. Despite job cuts, the company continues to move forward with updates to Windows 10. The latest Insider update added an unexpected feature — and ebook reader for the Edge web browser. Did anyone ask for this? And is it necessary? Meanwhile, at Google, the company’s developers are hard at working making 2017 the year Android and Chrome OS complete their Dragonball Z-style fusion. A recent update to the Chromium project website says that every new Chromebook released in 2017 will have support for Android apps. Google has also expanded support for past Chromebooks to a number of new systems, bringing the total number of Android-compatible devices well above 50. That’s impressive progress. Finally, we wrap up on a more futuristic note — Razer’s patent for OLED displays in keyboard and mice. The company has a long history of trying to put customization displays in weird places, often with success. This new patent suggests the company could take that a step further with OLED panels custom-fit for hardware, which are embedded within mice or keyboards and protected by “optically transmissive” material.

In 2007, Google launched the Lunar XPrize, a competition that will dole out $30 million in prizes to the first privately funded teams to land a robot on the moon. Since then, it’s been tough going. China managed to transport a probe before any of the XPrize competitors, in 2013. The initial early 2015 competition deadline was pushed back to 2017 out of necessity — only two teams managed to secure a launch contract. But there has been a promising development. On Tuesday, Google announced that five competitors have signed launch contracts that allow them to launch to the moon by the end of 2017. Among the five teams is Hakuto, a Japanese team with a pair of rovers; Moon Express, an American team that wants to collect moon samples for scientific study, signed a three-launch contract with Rocket Lab for 2020; SpaceIL, an Israel-based nonprofit is developing novel craft that explores the moon by taking big hops instead of driving around, will join a future SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch; Synergy Moon, an international team, has partnered with Interorbital Systems for launch; and Team Indus, an Indian team that will ride with the Indian Space Research Organization’s vehicle. More: Peter Diamandis’ XPrize to award the brightest advancement in AI with $5 million They’re taking the place of the competitors who’ve dropped out — more than 30 signed on to compete in 2007. Part-Time Scientists, a German teamed that had partnered with Audi to develop its lunar rover, canceled plans for a near-term launch. Carnegie Mellon University’s Astrobotic recently delayed its launch until 2019. Google and XPrize said that the $1 million Diversity Prize, initially to be awarded to teams that make “significant strides in promoting ethnic diversity within Science, Technology, Education, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines,” will be split among all remaining teams. The reason for all the challenges? There is more to the XPrize than meets the eye. Once teams’ rovers reach the moon’s surface, they must travel more than 1,640 feet and beam high-definition images and video back to Earth to claim the grand prize. The first team to do so will claim $20 million, while the second team will earn $5 million. Competitors can earn bonuses by completing tasks like traveling 10 times the baseline distance requirement (three miles), capturing images of the remains of the Apollo program or other man-made objects on the Moon, verifying from the lunar surface the recent detection of water ice on the moon, or surviving a lunar night.

The remaining competitors must launch their rovers prior to the deadline in order to remain eligible. Also watch: Share

The two are partnering up to launch a new round of smartwatches for 2017, the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style. Both will come out of the box running Android Wear 2.0 and although they’re not actually official, enough info on the watches have leaked that we know they’re coming. This time around we have some high-res renders (not that low-res mess from a few days ago) of the smaller, more feminine Watch Style courtesy of @evleaks. As you can see from the leaked renders, there are two different colors of the watch, a rose gold model with ivory straps, and silver version with beige straps. Seeing it in silver, the watch definitely has a more classic look to it, almost like the Pebble Round. Although I can’t say I’m too crazy about the design, we’ll have to see it in person before making a final judgement. Rumors say the LG Watch Style will feature a 1.2-inch 360 x 360 display, 240mAh battery, 512MB of RAM and be accompanied by the more full-featured Watch Sport with a 1.38-inch 480 x 480 display, 430mAh battery, and 768MB RAM. We’re sure high-res renders of the sport will be turning up before the watches are officially announced on February 9th.

News News Columnists Diane Bell Meet the Trumps of San Diego County The Trumps: Donald and Kenneth Courtesy of Kenneth Trump Kenneth Trump, of Escondido, shares the spotlight with a wax museum figure of President Donald Trump, no relation. Kenneth Trump, of Escondido, shares the spotlight with a wax museum figure of President Donald Trump, no relation. (Courtesy of Kenneth Trump) Diane BellContact Reporter No Trump Street, Trump Road or Trump Drive shows up on Google in San Diego County. There is no Trump tower and San Diego lawsuits over Trump University have been settled. The luxury Trump condo project once being built across the border in Baja went belly-up long ago (perhaps fortuitous given Trump’s current relationship with Mexico.) But there are some Trumps living here — who either vehemently do, or in many cases, do not — want to be associated with the newly elected president. In fact, Stephanie C. Richardson Trump, 55, is considering changing her name. “I  told my husband I’m going back to my maiden name,” the Spring Valley resident informed me Thursday. It’s a bit complicated and expensive to legally drop her last name, though, so she says she’ll probably revert to the hyphenated last name of Richardson-Trump which she used when she first got married. At the other end of the Trump spectrum is Dianne Bell (no relation), who grew up as Dianne Thornton Trump. She now lives in Vista with her husband as well as her brother, Curtis Thornton Trump. “I’ve had some people say, ‘I bet you want to change your name.’ I tell them, ‘No, I’m very proud of it. I love Donald J. Trump and what he is doing for the American people. He’s not giving away our jobs to other countries, and he wants to protect Americans by not letting everybody in without checking them out.” Meet the Trumps: My perusal of current county voting records turned up 10 Trumps, although there are undoubtedly others not registered or not of voting age. Only three of the 10 are registered as Republicans. Given the polarizing effect of our new president, I wondered what it was like to share his name — especially for the non-fans. Long before Donald Trump was elected, Kenneth Trump, 58, says his family received unsolicited comments regarding the high-profile real estate magnate. “My father’s name was Donald Trump,” says the Escondidan. “He’d come back from Las Vegas, saying, ‘Those people were so nice to me for some reason.’”  As to what his late father might say if he knew a “Donald Trump” had been elected President of the United States, Kenneth opines, “I know he is up in heaven laughing his (butt) off.” Donald C. Trump Jr., who served during the Korean war, is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in Point Loma. Kenneth Trump Donald C.

Trump Jr., who served during the Korean war, is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in Point Loma. (Kenneth Trump) While Kenneth didn’t vote for either Trump or Hillary Clinton, opting instead for the Independent candidate in protest, he is giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. “I’m waiting to see what happens. I may have to change my name in a year. We’ll see.” While the occasional ribbing about the Trump name has been harmless, Stephanie Trump says she and her husband, Patrick, are going to stop visiting the property they own in Mexico for a while. “There are lots of things I’d like to tell the president,” says Stephanie, who walked in the women’s protest march last Saturday. “But he probably wouldn’t listen. “He has created a lot of dissatisfaction but there’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll just have to ride out the next four years.”  Duane Trump Duane Trump Duane Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Duane Trump, of Del Mar Heights, reports being asked if he is related to Mr. Trump and getting razed about his name but  “all in good fun. … No one holds it against me.” Nevertheless, he has resorted to volunteering only his first name, if that suffices, when making dinner reservations and the like. Duane was not merely disappointed by Trump’s election but, being a mortgage underwriter, especially critical of one of the president’s first actions to overturn Obama’s FHA mortgage insurance fee cut. Duane’s spouse, Edan, legally changed his name to Trump about 17 years ago. At the time, the judge joked, “You know changing your name to Trump doesn’t mean you get part of the Trump fortune.” Brandon Stone golfer Brandon Stone golfer Brandon Stone golfer Brandon Stone of KUSI TV Courtesy of KUSI Brandon Stone of KUSI TV Brandon Stone of KUSI TV (Courtesy of KUSI) Introducing Brandon Stone — twice: When KUSI TV’s roving reporter Brandon Stone hit the links at Torrey Pines Farmers Insurance Open, he interviewed his alter ego — Brandon Stone, the PGA golfer. Beyond their names, the two men have little in common. The KUSI newsman is a black American while the golfer is a white South African. They discovered they share one connection, though. The TV reporter disclosed his parents almost named him “Pebble” Stone. “That’s my nickname,” confessed the golfer. High praise: As the Chinese Year of the Rooster, officially starts Saturday, San Diego Symphony conductor Jahja Ling has something to crow about. He was named a classical music icon this week in the county’s Bravo San Diego awards ceremony. In this Jan. 23 New York Times post, Peter Navarro is behind President Trump, second from the left.

The UC Irvine economics professor who ran for three political offices in San Diego, including mayor, between 1992 and 2001, told me several months ago he was not inclined to take a post in the administration should Trump be elected. How quickly minds change. As President Trump took his first executive actions, there was Trump’s new National Trade Council director, Peter Navarro, looming behind Trump in a New York Times photo of the president abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. diane.bell@sduniontribune.com (619) 293-1518 Twitter: @dianebellSD Facebook: dianebell.news Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The San Diego Union-Tribune Donald Trump Farmers Insurance Open Federal Housing Administration Border wall: San Diego's been there, done that The NFL team that might move to San Diego Rescued Yorkies now up to 123 US Politics NFL Latest Most Popular Today's Paper Jobs Homes Cars 48°

All of this can be done through the use of custom ROMs and luckily for Android users, there are a bunch of custom ROM developers. The most prolific name in the custom ROM scene is CyanogenMod but that has recently changed since Lineage OS came up. Regarding Lineage OS, this custom ROM developer team has quite an interesting story. When Lineage OS first started off its operating systems couldn’t even come close to the ones produced by CyanongenMod. Now things have changed and Lineage OS is the top custom ROM developer. Lineage OS was first released for Google’s own Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P but now a bunch of different builds are on their way. At the moment, Android power users will be able find on Lineage OS’s download portal Lineage 14.1 which is based on Android 7.1 Nougat and Lineage 13.0 which has been build around Android 6.0 Marshmallow. These builds are currently supported by the following devices: Moto G4, Moto G4 Plus, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Xiaomi Redmi 1S and Nextbit Robin. The developers behind Lineage OS have stated that they are working on a bunch of different builds which will be supported by a larger number of devices. During the upcoming future Lineage OS will make these builds available on its official webpage. The new builds will also be accompanied by a private key. What really makes Lineage OS stand out from the rest is the fact that it doesn’t require Android users to wipe their device’s data which is the usual process when installing custom ROMs. In fact, Lineage OS can be installed directly over already existing CyanogenMod ROMs. Instead of requiring users to flash the device, Lineage OS provides them with a separate flash zip file. Additionally, rumor has it that Lineage OS is working on launching 80 builds of Android Nougat and Android Marshmallow. Nonetheless, it’s great seeing that Lineage OS is making improvements and we expect that these upcoming builds will be released in the following weeks.

When a new successor comes to market there is always hopes that it will improve on a number of features of its predecessor. The follow-up to the Pixel appears to be heavily focused on the camera experience - one of the highlights of the current Pixel and Pixel XL. According to the folks at 9to5Google, it appears that the next Pixel will not get a bump up in megapixels, but Google is working to improve the image and video quality. As with any new flagship device, variants of the handset will offer a newer CPU, with a number of test models packing a newer Qualcomm Snapdragon and even Intel processors. One of the details that has yet to be confirmed is the inclusion of waterproofing. Initially, it was rumored that a waterproof successor was a sure thing, but it appears that Google is still deciding on whether this feature will arrive on the consumer version. Lastly, there could be a slight price bump with the arrival of the latest Pixel handsets, but Google could also debut a cheaper variant of the handset, with lower specs, that is destined for other markets.

Millions of web pages, databases and servers all run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But the so-called “visible” Internet — sites that can be found using search engines like Google and Yahoo — is just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface is the Deep Web, which accounts for approximately 90 per cent of all websites. In fact, this hidden Web is so large that it is impossible to discover exactly how many pages or sites are active at any given time. This Web was once the province of hackers, law enforcement officers and criminals. However, new technology like encryption and the anonymisation browser software, Tor, now makes it possible for anyone to dive deep if they are interested. What is the Dark Web? There are a number of terms surrounding the non-visible Web, but it is worth knowing how they differ if you are planning to browse off the beaten path. The ‘Dark Web’ refers to sites with criminal intent or illegal content, and ‘trading’ sites where users can purchase illicit goods or services. In other words, the Deep covers everything under the surface that is still accessible with the right software, including the Dark Web. There is also a third term, “Dark Internet” that refers to sites and databases that are not available over public Internet connections, even if you are using Tor. Often, Dark Internet sites are used by companies or researchers to keep sensitive information private. How is it accessed? Most people who wish to access the Deep Web use Tor, a service originally developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory. Think of Tor as a Web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. The main difference is that, instead of taking the most direct route between your computer and the deep parts of the Web, the Tor browser uses a random path of encrypted servers, also known as “nodes.” This allows users to connect to the Deep Web without fear of their actions being tracked or their browser history being exposed. Sites on the Deep also use Tor (or similar software such as I2P) to remain anonymous, meaning you will not be able to find out who is running them or where they are being hosted. Many users now leverage Tor to browse both the public Internet and the Deep. Some simply do not want government agencies or even Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to know what they are looking at online, while others have little choice — users in countries with strict access and usage laws are often prevented from accessing even public sites unless they use Tor clients and virtual private networks (VPNs). The same is true for government critics and other outspoken advocates who fear backlash if their real identities were discovered. Of course, anonymity comes with a dark side since criminals and malicious hackers also prefer to operate in the shadows. Use and misuse For some users, the Deep Web offers the opportunity to bypass local restrictions and access TV or movie services that may not be available in their local areas. Others go deep to download pirated music or grab movies that are not yet in theatres. At the dark end of the Web, meanwhile, things can get scary, salacious and just plain...strange. As noted by The Guardian, for example, credit card data is available on the Dark Web for just a few dollars per record, while ZDNet notes that anything from fake citizenship documents to passports and even the services of professional hitmen are available if you know where to look. Interested parties can also grab personal details and leverage them to blackmail ordinary Internet users. Consider the recent Ashley Madison hack — vast amounts of account data, including real names, addresses and phone numbers — ended up on the Dark Web for sale. This proves that, even if you do not surf the murky waters of the Dark Web, you could be at risk of blackmail (or worse) if sites you regularly use are hacked. Illegal drugs are also a popular draw on the Dark Web. As noted by Motherboard, drug marketplace Silk Road — which has been shut down, replaced, shut down again and then rebranded — offers any type of substance in any amount to interested parties. Business Insider, meanwhile, details some of the strange things you can track down in the Deep, including a DIY vasectomy kit and a virtual scavenger hunts that culminated in the “hunter” answering a NYC payphone at 3 am. What are the real risks of the Dark Web? Thanks to the use of encryption and anonymisation tools by both users and websites, there is virtually no law enforcement presence down in the Dark. This means anything — even material well outside the bounds of good taste and common decency — can be found online. This includes offensive, illegal “adult” content that would likely scar the viewer for life. A recent Wired article, for example, reports that 80 per cent of Dark Web hits are connected to paedophilia and child pornography. Here, the notion of the Dark as a haven for privacy wears thin and shores up the notion that if you do choose to go Deep, always restrict access to your Tor-enabled device so that children or other family members are not at risk of stumbling across something no one should ever see. Visit the Deep Web if you are interested, but do yourself a favour: do not let kids anywhere near it and tread carefully — it is a long way down.

The simple idea is to give a government more stability and end the merry-go-round which often characterises Italian politics. Under the Italicum, which only relates to the lower house of parliament, there’ll be a two-part ballot that will guarantee a big majority to the winning party, provided they gain at least 40 percent in the second round. Political analyst Marco Cacciotto spoke to euronews of the inherent risks: “Basically it gives potentially a big majority bonus. But with a fragmentation of political forces (which is the case in Italy), a party can reach the second round having taken just the 20% (of the votes). And this party could finally have 55% of the seats in parliament.”. The two-round system is widely used around the world for the election of legislative bodies and directly elected presidents, such as in France for example. In Italy, it is used to elect mayors. “Initially the two round ballot was not expected, but by introducing it the law makes sure that no political force can achieve the majority bonus with a too low a threshold and you can have this just with a second round,” said Cacciotto. In the past, Italy’s Constitutional Court has decided that electoral laws must maintain the principle of a multi-polar political system. “In other countries with majoritarian systems, the key factor is governability and proportionally representing the electorate is less important,” added Cacciotto. The court’s ruling could determine Italy’s immediate political future and whether there’ll be an early poll in June and also put in place a system for years to come.

And the partisan divisions over many of the public’s priorities – from dealing with global climate change to strengthening the nation’s military – remain as wide as ever, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center published on Tuesday. Roughly three-quarters say that defending the country from terrorism (76%) and strengthening the economy (73%) should be top priorities for Congress and the new president. And two-thirds or more prioritize improving the educational system (69%), improving the job situation (68%) and reducing health care costs (66%). These all have ranked among the public’s top policy priorities in recent years. Still, there are some changes in the public’s to-do list: A majority of Americans (55%) now cite protecting the environment as a top priority, up from 47% a year ago. Global trade, which ranks relatively low on the public’s policy agenda, is viewed as more important than in the past. Currently, 40% say dealing with global trade issues should be a top policy priority, up from 31% last year. On the other hand, the share viewing immigration as a top priority has declined, from 51% to 43%, since January 2016. The survey finds little change over the past year regarding the importance of reducing the budget deficit. But the deficit is viewed as a less important priority today than it was during most of Obama’s second term. Currently, 52% say reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Four years ago, after Obama’s reelection, 72% viewed cutting the deficit as a top priority. Among the survey’s other key findings: Wide partisan gap over dealing with climate change As in previous policy priority surveys, the widest partisan gap is on the importance of dealing with global climate change. About six-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (62%) say this should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Just 15% of Republicans say the same – making climate change by far the lowest-ranked of 21 policy priorities among Republicans and leaners. Majorities in both parties now prioritize reducing health care costs While there are wide partisan differences on whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), majorities of both Republicans (69%) and Democrats (63%) say reducing health care costs should be a top goal of the president and Congress. For Republicans, this represents a sizable change in attitudes. In 2009, just 44% of Republicans cited the reduction of health care costs as a top priority. Over the past year alone, the share of Republicans who say cutting health care costs should be a top priority has increased from 57% to 69%. Democrats’ views have shown less change over this period. Older adults give greater priority to military, immigration and entitlements The policy priorities of young people and older Americans differ in key respects. Older adults are more likely to prioritize strengthening the military, reducing the influence of lobbyists, immigration, Medicare and Social Security, among other issues. Conversely, younger people are more likely than their elders to prioritize environmental concerns. Fewer view the economy, jobs as top priorities today than did so in Obama’s first year While the economy remains one of the top priorities for most Americans, that share has declined over the past several years (from 85% in January 2009 and 86% in January 2013 to 73% today). Similarly, while about two-thirds (68%) now rate improving the job situation as a top priority, public emphasis on the employment situation in the country has declined in recent years – eight years ago (82%) and four years ago (79%), roughly eight-in-ten Americans rated this a top priority. The survey was conducted Jan. 4-9, 2017 among 1,502 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points for results based on the full sample.

The deal came after two days of discussions in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. Rebel and government delegates have held indirect talks for the first time in nine months. Kazakhstan’s Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov said the powers had agreed in their final communique to establish a system to observe and ensure full compliance with the ceasefire, prevent any provocations and sort out the mechanism to make the truce work. The opposition delegation said it didn’t officially receive any draft communique. Its spokesman Osama Abu Zaid argued they couldn’t therefore comment on anything being published on social media. “The main obstacle for the success of this conference and these negotiations is the continuation of violations by the Assad regime and the threat of forced displacement in many areas (of Syria). we cannot talk about any progress before changes begin to happen on the ground,” he said. The Syrian government representative claimed the opposition was linked to foreign agendas and working for foreign powers. “The issue here is not about who is happy and who is not happy. The issue here is that finally we have a consensual paper called final communique, or final declaration, agreed upon by everybody. This is a result, this is what we should care about,” said the Syrian government’s chief negotiator Bashar Ja’afari. The three sponsor countries did not spell out how the monitoring mechanism would work; they are to meet soon according to the UN’s envoy Staffan De Mistura. The Syrian government say an offensive against rebels west of Damascus will continue; rebels say it’s a major violation of the latest ceasefire agreed on December 30.

But the two browsers are more alike than they used to be. A recent change in Firefox, for instance, adds support for multiple processes, making it less likely that the whole browser will crash when one component changes. That’s been a Chrome feature for ages (and the Chrome implementation is more extensive). Firefox is also an open source browser maintained by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, while Chrome is a Google project that shares a lot of code with the open source Chromium browser… but Chrome itself is not free and open source software.

However, this means that it is not just elected MPs who will vote on the ‘European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act’. The Lords, the unelected political appointees who make up the upper chamber of the UK parliament will also have to pass this legislation. This is a potential problem for Prime Minister May, who has purposefully introduced a two-line bill, in order to make it tough for ‘Remain’ supporting legislators to amend. The Lords, unlike the Commons where MPs sit, is not controlled by May’s Conservative Party. Instead it consists of 805 political appointees, 689 of whom are ‘life peers’ who will keep their seat until death (90 are hereditary peers, the other 26 are bishops of the Church of England). Only 253 of the 805 are Conservative. This means that Labour and the Liberal Democrats (as well as so-called cross bench peers, who do not belong to a party and vote issue by issue) have a great amount of power to alter and even block legislation. It is thought that a majority of the Lords are in favour of remaining part of the EU. It is unlikely that the Lords will actually go as far to block the legislation. Lord Newby, leader of the 101 Liberal Democrat Lords said “People here (in the Lords) aren’t stupid… our role isn’t to frustrate the will of the people”. Another legislator, the Labour Party’s Lord Blunkett, said to block Brexit legislation would be “foolish in the extreme”. However as Baroness Wheatcroft, a senior Conservative peer, said in August “there’s a majority in the Lords for remaining (in the EU)”. And this has clearly made May and her government nervous in recent months. In November it was decided to cancel plans to reform the way the unelected upper house works. Currently, the Lords must approve any bill or amendment that MPs pass, before it can be passed to the Queen to be signed and made law. However, a proposal from the Strathclyde review would have banned the Lords from blocking legislation, by giving parliament the power to force any bill through (parliament’s powers to push legislation through is currently limited). This decision was reportedly prompted by fears that angering the Lords may affect their willingness to allow Brexit legislation through.

A study [PDF] from the University of New South Wales in Australia and the University of California at Berkeley found that Android apps advertising themselves as VPN clients often contain poor security protections, and in some cases engage in outright malicious activities. "Many apps may legitimately use the VPN permission to offer (some form of) online anonymity or to enable access to censored content," the researchers write. "However, malicious app developers may abuse it to harvest users' personal information." That sort of malicious activity is shockingly common, the researchers found. They studied the activity of 283 VPN apps on the Google Play store and catalogued the various risky and malicious activities they found: 82 per cent of the VPN apps requested permission to access sensitive data on the device, such as SMS history. 38 per cent of the apps contained some form of malware. 16 per cent routed traffic through other devices, rather than a host server. 16 per cent use in-path proxies to modify HTML traffic in transit. Three of the 283 analysed apps specifically intercept bank, messaging, and social network traffic. "Our results show that – in spite of the promises for privacy, security and anonymity given by the majority of VPN apps – millions of users may be unawarely subject to poor security guarantees and abusive practices inflicted by VPN apps," the researchers noted. The study concluded that, in addition to users being wary in their choice of VPN apps and keeping a close eye on permissions, Google should look to help remedy the situation by setting stricter limits on what VPN apps are able to do in Android. "The ability of the BIND_VPN_SERVICE permission to break Android's sandboxing and the naive perception that most users have about third-party VPN apps suggest that it is urging [sic] to re-consider Android's VPN permission model to increase the control over VPN clients," they said. "Our analysis of the user reviews and the ratings for VPN apps suggested that the vast majority of users remain unaware of such practices even when considering relatively popular apps." Before picking a VPN provider/app, make sure you do some research https://t.co/vuQ0drVZPN – or consider Algo https://t.co/J145Z8XMsv — The Register (@TheRegister) January 27, 2017 So, if you're shopping for a VPN client, what should you do? Well, a little research goes a long way: check reviews and recommendations, and steer clear of overreaching applications. "Always pay attention to the permissions requested by apps that you download," said Professor Dali Kaafar, a senior researcher at CSIRO, the Australian government's boffinry nerve center. "This study shows that VPN app users, in particular, should take the time to learn about how serious the issues with these apps are and the significant risks they are taking using these services.” ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register AWS: We're gonna make mobile apps great again with Lambda functions The best apps will come from America, using Amazon, which will be paying all that tax 8 Comments Bad news, fandroids: Mobile banking malware now encrypts files First Faketoken stole credentials, now it holds data to ransom 15 Comments Honey, why are porno apps on your Android?!

With Chrome and Firefox’s latest updates (versions 56 and 51, respectively), users will be notified if they’re sending sensitive information over insecure HTTP connections, rather than the safer HTTPS protocol. Important data that can be compromised under these channels includes login details, passwords and banking information. This functionality has been available in beta versions of the browsers, but is now rolling out for most users. Previously with Firefox, only a green lock would be shown for a HTTPS connection, with no indication for HTTP connections. Now, Mozilla has added a grey padlock icon with a red strike through it on HTTP sites which ask users for their passwords. When the lock is clicked on, a message that reads “Logins entered on this page could be compromised” will pop up. In the past, Chrome also didn’t explicitly label unsafe connections. With the latest update, though, the warning is right in the title bar. These changes are being introduced following the results of a study published last year, which showed that many users weren’t noticing if some sites were unsafe.

MONEY How to Make Real Money From Virtual Things From Bitcoin to Kimoji, there's a whole new economy of intangible goods ready for your business to sell. By Zoë Henry Zoë Henry is a staff reporter at Inc. and a graduate of Brown University. She lives in Brooklyn, New York. @ZoeLaHenry Reporter, Inc.@ZoeLaHenry WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Illustrations by Bewilder Advertisement Just a decade ago, few would have guessed that virtual goods could create a real market. Then the smartphone age sparked a whole new universe of ephemeral, yet lucrative, commerce. "People have gotten much more comfortable with the idea of paying for things that are virtual," says Joost van Dreunen, the co-founder and CEO of SuperData, a gaming research firm. For startups in this fast-growing market, the goods may be fake, but the sales are real. Some of the most promising new areas of business are hidden behind what can sound like Millennial smartphone-speak: Kimoji! Color bombs! Bitcoin! But these terms--meaning, respectively, Kim Kardashian images, Candy Crush aids, and digital currency--represent some of the biggest breakthroughs in the virtual goods economy, which now accounts for more than $100 billion in global sales, van Dreunen estimates. "We're attributing value to things that have no inherent value," he says. Here are four ways that you, too, may be able to capture the real spending on fake things: Stickers and emoji: Replace words with pictures You probably already fill some of your text messages with emoji, those digital images that range from sad faces and broken hearts to suggestive produce and party hats. Their more commercial cousins are "stickers," which can be tailored to specific events, brands, or people--like the wildly successful Kardashian line, which made more than $2.8 million in global revenue in 2016, according to market researcher Sensor Tower. Who is making money: App makers, marketers, and branding firms can most easily jump into the sticker industry. How to do it: If your core business is apps, consider designing a line of stickers to sell via the stores run by Apple and Google. Most sticker makers don't charge much, usually 99 cents to $1.99 per collection (minus the stores' 30 percent cut). The payoff is slim if you're doing this on your own, so many app makers get involved only once they have a paying client on board--usually a company or a celebrity who commissions stickers and the related "keyboard" technology. $50 million- $100 million Annual U.S. digital ad sales from stickers and emoji Who's succeeding: Big tech companies like Facebook dominate, but there is some room for startups. Vivian Rosenthal, the founder of New York City-based sticker-tech firm Snaps, has worked with clients including Pepsi, Nike, Heidi Klum, and Kim Kardashian. Yet Rosenthal says that celebrity content makes up only a small portion of her sales: "The bigger opportunity we're seeing is for brands" to create stickers for advertising, she says. Since launching in 2011, Snaps has signed deals with more than 100 companies, each of which pays from $10,000 to $100,000 per month for its own tailored keyboards and related products. The risks: Since revenue per transaction is so small, it's a race against time to acquire enough customers. That's part of what doomed Hi-Art, a New York City startup that made stickers for some celebrity musicians. "We still weren't growing enough that we were profitable on in-app purchases alone," says co-founder Brian Lederman. His advice: Move quickly to strike distribution deals with big messaging services, such as Line, Kik, or WeChat. Those third parties may pay to license your content, which they can then distribute to their hundreds of millions of users.   Mobile gaming: Waste time more efficiently More than 138 million Americans play mobile games, most of which are free to download--and many then pay for small in-app purchases that help them win those games more quickly. (Thanks, color bombs!) Who is making money: Mobile game studios. Some other developers of recreational apps, including online dating services and language-learning programs, also benefit from this free-to-play, pay-to-advance model. How to do it: If you've designed and published a mobile game, you might expect to earn about $25 per paying player per month from in-app sales, according to mobile marketing company Swrve. The challenge is to find and keep those big spenders: Overall, just 1.9 percent of players make purchases on mobile games. Here, again, the app stores will take 30 percent off the top. $6.7 billion U.S. mobile game revenue in 2016 $37 billion Global spending on mobile gaming in 2016 Who's succeeding: Traditional game publishers like Electronic Arts are investing serious cash in mobile games; more recent winners include Activision's King, the maker of Candy Crush, and Jam City, the seven-year-old private Los Angeles game developer previously known as SGN. Jam City counts 45 million users across hundreds of titles, and says it's on track to do $400 million in annual sales; one of its products is Cookie Jam, a series of puzzles that charges users for extra lives or moves. The company has entire teams dedicated to tracking players' progress and coming up with new levels and obstacles, says Jam City co-founder Josh Yguado: "What's beautiful about the mobile gaming industry is that you have so much day-to-day understanding of what virtual goods users are purchasing, and at what point they're dropping out." The risks: Remember, a very small segment of users (in Jam City's case, fewer than 10 percent) choose to purchase digital goods, so you need to consistently make new content. "If you think you have the perfect game, and you have a one-track development process, you will almost by definition fail," warns Yguado.   Virtual currency: Spend money on new money You've probably heard of Bitcoin--but what about Ether, Dogecoin, and Zcash? Most such online-only "cryptocurrencies" aren't controlled by government entities like the Federal Reserve. That has helped them attract a following among digital privacy advocates, investors looking for the next hot commodity, and, yes, less savory elements looking for a digital equivalent of untraceable cash. Who is making money: Financial services and technology startups, especially those with experience in the complicated and highly regulated financial markets, are best positioned to jump into the world of virtual money--or the related "blockchain" technology that helps it move around the digital universe. How to do it: Your biggest business opportunity is to start what's known as a digital wallet or an exchange, where you generate revenue by charging fees to buy or sell these virtual assets. (Examples include the San Francisco-based startups Coinbase and Kraken, and the Omaha-based Exodus.) Some startups are looking to the blockchain, developing and selling applications for this new type of financial system. James Gatto, a partner specializing in virtual currency for law firm Sheppard Mullin, calls blockchain-related tech "the greatest value of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem." $400 million Annual fees that can be collected from trading digital currencies Who's succeeding: One of the leading digital currency startups is five-year-old exchange Coinbase. It counts 4.5 million customers, who buy and sell currency on its website. The company has facilitated $5 billion worth of transactions for consumers and institutional investors. "The line between investing and use has been blurred with the advent of digital currencies," says co-founder Fred Ehrsam. The risks: Regulation! Though the currencies themselves may not be government controlled, those that handle them must navigate U.S. financial rules. Ehrsam estimates that his startup has spent $10 million on red tape, including getting registered by the U.S. Treasury and obtaining money transmitter licenses in dozens of states. (Coinbase is also fielding an IRS probe over users buying Bitcoin to avoid paying taxes.) Another challenge was the time-consuming process of establishing banking relationships to let users sync their financial accounts. As Ehrsam says, "The business is a really hard one to build."   Virtual assistants: Provide invisible help Think Siri or Alexa: There's a growing demand for digital assistants that can understand spoken requests and perform tasks, such as scheduling a meeting, calling a friend, or making a payment. Who is making money: Startups that develop machine learning for existing digital assistants stand to make the most money, while some newcomers are creating their own app-based assistants. How to do it: This new breed of artificial intelligence is built on speech-recognition programs and other quickly evolving technologies. If you have a smart group of programmers eager to take on a sophisticated topic, you could develop and sell a standalone app, or license it to third-party companies for a fee. (Take NextIT, based in Spokane, Washington, which licenses its Alme platform to businesses and also builds custom digital assistants for individual companies.) Or you could sell your whole company: Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all recently acquired machine-learning startups--some for hundreds of millions of dollars--to power their own digital assistants. $13.7 billion Projected size of the global cognitive computing market, which includes machine learning and automated reasoning, by 2020 Who's succeeding: A number of startups are making standalone digital assistants, including the Santa Clara, California-based SoundHound and the Mountain View, California-based EasilyDo. And some entrepreneurs are serial innovators: In 2005, William Tunstall-Pedoe launched what became Evi Technologies, a Cambridge, England-based software maker that eventually created its own digital assistant. In 2012, he sold the company to Amazon for a reported $26 million; now, the e-commerce giant uses Evi's technology to enhance its own digital assistant, Alexa. Tunstall-Pedoe, who left Amazon a year ago, is considering starting another A.I. business. And he sees plenty of room for new A.I.-related startups to find "massive" success: "It's a super exciting space." The risks: Big, big-name competition. Since the tech giants are already making digital assistants, yours needs to significantly improve on what's widely available. "It would be difficult to create a standard, Alexa-like product unless you have very unique technology," Tunstall-Pedoe says. FROM THE FEBRUARY 2017 ISSUE OF INC. MAGAZINE Advertisement

But other than the threat of hackers, the government may also be spying on us using our online accounts, as exemplified by Twitter. The social media platform announced Friday it received two national security requests, one each in 2015 and 2016, asking for users' account data without informing the affected users. The company could not reveal this earlier since it was bound by gag orders until now that restricted it from openly speaking about the matter. The requests were received in the form of national security letters (NSLs). “We have provided each of the account holders with copies of the relevant NSLs (certain information redacted to protect privacy) as well as the account data we were compelled to produce,” the company said in an official blog post. The letters have also been published on Twitter’s blog. The revelation follows similar admissions from Google and Yahoo in recent months. Each letter requests a special kind of data called electronic communication transaction records, including email header data and browsing history. Related Stories The @POTUS Twitter Account Was Linked To A Gmail Account And Wasn't Protected By Two-Factor Authentication Alt-Right Crowdfunding Effort To Sue Twitter FBI requests go far beyond the limitations set by a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which said such orders could only be restricted to phone billing records. “While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,” the company’s blog post added. NSLs are government orders used for obtaining communication data available to service providers. They are usually accompanied by a gag order restricting the provider from informing the user whose data is obtained. The legal tool has been available since the 1970s, but has been put into regular usage for varied purposes since the passing of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, passed shortly after Sept. 11, 2011, terror attacks. The use of NSLs to obtain data is being opposed by major tech companies including Twitter which is fighting its own lawsuit against the government — Twitter v. Lynch.

(Getty Images) Shares2 Sat, 28 Jan 2017-01:28pm , Washington , Reuters An Federal Bureau of Investigation inspector general 2014 report indicated that it disagreed with the memo's guidance. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) appeared to go beyond the scope of existing legal guidance in seeking certain kinds of internet records from Twitter as recently as 2016, legal experts said, citing two warrantless surveillance orders the social media company published on Friday. Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet's Google and Yahoo. Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo's guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. "While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the US Department of Justice," Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. "This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended," said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of 2016 the US Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

Dear Millennials: It’s Not Your Fault How To Teach Your Children To Be Entrepreneurial [Infographic] 10 Must-Have Apps for Your Teen's Smartphone How to Teach Your Non-Tech Savvy Parents Some Useful Skills Larry Alton Business Consultant Share More Tweet Share Save Share Stumble Email How to Teach Your Non-Tech Savvy Parents Some Useful Skills Larry Alton Business Consultant | Parents are great. They know a lot about life that we certainly don’t know. However, they aren’t always the most technologically advanced individuals on the face of the planet. As the saying goes, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” Instead of trying to deal with all of your parents’ seemingly endless issues over the phone for the next couple of decades, it’s just better to teach them a thing or two. Here are some of the easiest ways to do just that. 1. Use a Screencast If your parent is having a difficult time completing a task on their computer, one of the best things you can do is create a screencast for them. This is especially valuable if it’s something they need to do repeatedly, but will likely forget. “When creating the screencast, it’s best to plan it out a little bit in advance,” millennial, Adam Dachis says. “This doesn’t mean you need to spend a ton of time on it, but just take a minute to think about the steps you’re going to cover in advance so your instructions are clear and succinct.” 2. Sign Them Up for a Tech Support Service Did you know that there are tech support services that specialize in providing people with wide ranging issues? Yes, you can actually sign your parents up for a service that provides them with unlimited tech support for every device and issue you can imagine. Whether it’s a virus, problem with email, issue connecting to WiFi, problem accessing a smartphone app, or anything in between, a full-service tech support plan gives your parents someone else to contact. 3. Give Them Some Reading Material The reason many parents have so many questions for you is that they don’t have the material they need to do it themselves. By providing your parents with some reading material, YouTube videos, and other resources, you can give them the tools needed to figure it out on their own. 4. Show Them How to Work Google When you have a technical issue with something in your life, what’s the first thing you do? Most people your age simply type a question into Google and look for answers. Parents don’t always do this because they aren’t well versed in how to use Google efficiently for problem solving. One of the best things you can do is teach your parents how to use Google. Don’t assume that they already know. Show them how it works and teach them how to type in inquiries and get relevant responses. 5. Avoid Using Confusing Jargon Words that may seem commonplace to you could very likely be foreign to your parents. When explaining concepts, don’t assume that they understand what you’re talking about. Even using a term like “copy and paste” could confuse them. For best results, try to speak in analogies and explain any concept that doesn’t make sense outside of the context of the technology being used. You’ll feel like you’re dumbing things down too much, but they’ll let you know if you’re going too far. Don’t Leave Your Parents Hanging It may be annoying to receive multiple requests from your mom or dad asking about how to use an emoji in a text message, but it’s not the end of the world. Instead of just doing it for her, show her how to do it. Your parents aren’t dumb; they just didn’t grow up in the same world of technology that you did. Pay it forward and teach them a thing or two. You’ll all be happier. Featured photo credit: Shutterstock.com via shutterstock.com Love this article?

Photo: Reuters/Lucas Jackson Reuters Microsoft Corp's (MSFT. O) market capitalization topped $500 billion for the first time since 2000 on Friday, after the technology giant's stock rose following another quarter of results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Shares of the world's biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts' average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company's profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street's expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company's efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company's stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. "The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it "buy" or higher, eight have a "hold" rating and two "strong sell".

Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet’s Google and Yahoo. Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo’s guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. “While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,” Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. “This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended,” said Crocker, whose organisation is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of last year the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

Shares of the world’s biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion. Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple Inc’s market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet Inc’s market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts’ average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company’s profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street’s expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company’s efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company’s stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to data collected by a foreign news agency. “The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it “buy” or higher, eight have a “hold” rating and two “strong sell”.

"Pornocracy", made by Ovidie, a former French porn star turned director, claims that far fewer films are now being made and fees have been slashed up to 10-fold. She blames "tube" sites -- so-called because they resemble YouTube -- which have been accused of hosting thousands of videos pirated from traditional adult entertainment companies. Critics say children are also getting their first exposure to sex through the sites. And they worry about the effect porn culture is having on the way teenage boys treat girls. "Tubes" are also blamed for making porn consumption so commonplace that last week London's transport system was forced to warn that people who watched porn on buses and trains would be reported to the police. Children's campaigner Marie Derain, an advisor to the French women and families minister, said the exploitive nature of "tube" sites was extremely worrying. "Their economic model goes beyond even what is at stake in terms of pornography," she told AFP. - Nearly all pirated - Gregory Dorcel, who heads Marc Dorcel, Europe's third-biggest adult entertainment group, said 95 percent of the 100 billion porn clips watched on the web last year were pirated. His company alone has made five million requests to Google for its videos to be taken down from "tubes". "But 48 hours later the videos are back online," Ovidie said. Her documentary claims that a little-known company called MindGeek -- headquartered in "an empty office" in Luxembourg -- is now porn's most powerful player, holding a monopoly-like grip on the industry. But MindGeek, which prefers to be seen as a tech company, and makes no reference to porn on its website, told AFP that it operates only four "tube" sites -- Pornhub, Youporn, RedTube and Tube8. "Claims that we dominate the industry are nonsense," a spokeswoman said, saying that only three of its sites ranked in the top 10 of the world's most visited adult sites. Pornhub alone, however, is the 11th most viewed site in the US, just behind Wikipedia, Twitter and Instagram. MindGeek says it is simply a platform for its "1,000 content partners that upload content and benefit from the exposure on our sites". "There is lot of misinformation about how tube sites function," the spokeswoman said. She said it followed YouTube's lead on "managing the issue of copyrights". "There is no room in our model for the assumption that content is pirated," she added. She claimed instead that they had "formed positive, symbiotic relationships with most of the major players in the industry". Many traditional adult film makers dispute this, also complaining that while they are subject to strict regulations on age, the "tubes" can easily be viewed by children. - Kids see porn by 11 - The French pressure group Ennocence, which is trying to make regulation of the "tubes" an issue in the country's coming presidential election, said children now tend to first view porn at 11. Its president, Gordon Choisel, said they were being bombarded with adult images through internet adverts from a very young age. "You think your child is watching a cartoon but then a window pops up with porn," he said. Choisel said governments had to attack the sites' advertising streams. "We have to come up with legislation that is flexible enough to adapt to changes in technology and the way videos are being watched," he said. Derain, author of a 2012 report on children's viewing habits, said porn was shaping many young people's view of sex. "Sexuality in real life is not like that," she said, but children who have grown up watching "tubes" have trouble making the distinction. "I have been involved in a number of very serious criminal cases where boys have systematically done to girls what they saw on porn," she said. "Pornocracy" also dealt with the explosion in "cam girl" sites and what Ovidie termed the "new proletariat of sex" who work long hours on them. She said the women get only around 15 percent of what their clients pay to watch them perform online. Up to 70 percent goes to such platforms, including Live Jasmin, also based in Luxembourg, which has annual revenue of more than $300 million and has made its owner, Gyorgy Gattyan, Hungary's second-richest man, according to Forbes magazine. But Marton Fulop, the operations director at Live Jasmin, which is often called the "peep show Uber", justified the amounts paid to its two million registered cam girls, saying it was a tech company "that provided a very good platform". 28 Jan 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

Sign up By Catherine Salvador , Christian Post Contributor Jan 27, 2017 | 12:05 PM x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The all-new Cisco Spark Board is created to define how companies conduct their conference meetings. The board has just been announced by the company on Tuesday and it is believed to bring a tight competition with the Microsoft Surface Hub and Google Jamboard. CiscoCisco Spark Board is the product of the company's partnership with Apple. Cisco Spark Board may become the benchmark of how conference meetings should be conducted. The device is compared to function like a tablet, though it has a gigantic screen fit for a video conference. There is also a home button to allow the user to access the main menu easier than before. "For this product, we needed something that was familiar. We needed an experience that was obvious," said senior vice president and general manager of IoT and applications, Rowan Trollope. Trollope's statement pertains to the partnership of Cisco and Apple so that Spark Board can work compatibly with iPhone, though it can also run smoothly with other devices. And since the board is made to be convenient, the home button feature is a perfect fit. Cisco is reportedly focusing on the ease of use and simplicity, which is different from what Cisco has been developing for their other products. The Spark Board can run Spark — a cloud-based service made for collaboration activities. Users can draw images with their fingers, or use an aluminum pen that can also serve as an eraser — just like what a whiteboard eraser does. The screen can also be zoomed in our out by just pinching the screen, similar to what it being done to handsets and tablets. Cisco Spark Board has two variants available: 55-inch and 7-inch sizes. Both variants are capable of supporting 4K display. It also has its own camera, speakers and microphone. The price is set at $4,999 for the smaller version and the $9,990 for the larger one. A $199 monthly fee is required for software update. Share on facebook Share on twitter Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit Free sign up cp newsletter!

The tech companies have been speaking up since the last eight months about the NSLs "that came with gag orders that prevented Twitter from telling the public or the targeted users about the government's demands in two letters it received in 2015 and 2016", Tech Crunch reported. The FBI recently lifted these gag orders, allowing Twitter to acknowledge the NSLs for the first time. In the newly published NSLs, the FBI asked Twitter to turn over "the name, address, length of service, and electronic communications transactional records" of two users. The micro-blogging site said it gave a "very limited set of data" in response to the requests and demanded more freedom in keeping their point. "Twitter remains unsatisfied with restrictions on our right to speak more freely about national security requests we may receive, Twitter associate general counsel Elizabeth Banker wrote in a blog post. "We would like a meaningful opportunity to challenge government restrictions when 'classification' prevents speech on issues of public importance," Banker added. Twitter has already disclosed these two letters and informed the targeted users and is suing the Department of Justice in an effort to speak more publicly about secret requests for user data. --IANS sku/sm/bg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features In pictures: India's Republic Day Parade 2017 Tamil Nadu fights back on Jallikattu Jallikattu ban: Taming culture?

The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 was first formally unveiled at a press event in Taiwan in August, after which it was shown off at a press conference at IFA in Berlin, Germany. Now, a new version of the tablet has been unveiled, called the ZenPad 3S 10 LTE, meaning that customers have a few options for the tablet they want to buy, if they want to buy a ZenPad. Asus launches the ZenPad 3S 10 LTE The new variant of the tablet offers quite a few different specs compared to the original tablet. As the name suggests, the device boasts LTE support, and it has the model number Z500KL. Apart from that, however, the tablet packs a new Snapdragon 650 processor, along with a 9.7-inch display and a pixel resolution of 1,536 x 2,048. The tablet also boasts 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The tablet offers an 8MP rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing shooter. On top of that it boasts a whopping 7,800mAh battery, which really improves on the original, and it runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 LTE comes in Slate Grey, and is available in Malaysia with a price tag of RM1,799, or $405. Of course, the new ZenPad 3S 10 LTE isn’t the only version of the ZenPad 3S 10. The original Asus ZenPad 3S 10 Asus reintroduced the ZenPad 3S 10, an Android-based tablet which the firm formally unveiled at an event in Taiwan in early August, but it also showed the tablet off at IFA in September. The specifications, as you might expect, didn’t change in the intervening weeks. The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 leans somewhat toward the larger end of the Android tablet spectrum at 9.7 inches. But unlike some of the plastic competition (I’m looking at you, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2), it features a unibody of sandblasted aluminum, curved edges, a matte texture, and diamond-cut chamfered sides. All the more impressive? It’s a mere 5.8mm thick — thinner than both Apple’s iPad Pro 9.7 (6.1mm) and Google’s Pixel C (7mm). Asus’s is targeting the premium market, and it shows. On the hardware end of things, the ZenPad 10 doesn’t disappoint. It sports a high-resolution, 9.7-inch QXGA 2,048 x 1,536-pixel screen with a wraparound, 5.3 mm-thin bezel that Asus claims is the “thinnest” and “most compact” on a tablet of the ZenPad 10’s size. Internally, a MediaTek processor and 4GB of RAM juggle all the software tasks and 64GB of onboard memory handles storage. There’s a MicroSD Card in tow that supports cards up to 128GB in capacity, and a fingerprint sensor, too — an Asus tablet first. The ZenPad 10’s other highlight is high-end audio. The tablet’s stereo system packs two five-magnet speakers paired with a built-in NXP amplifier that Asus said provides protection against the “distortion” and “long-term … damage” that sometimes occurs at high volumes. A separate Hi-Res Audio (HRA) component supports 24-bit, 192kHz audio — “4x the quality of CD audio,” Asus said — and, when you’re using headphones, delivers optional virtual surround sound (courtesy DTS Headphone:X) that mimics a 7.1 setup. Related: Asus outs the ZenPad 3 8.0, boasting a 2K display and up to 4GB of RAM Powering the ZenPad 10 is a 5,900mAh battery that Asus said last around 10 hours if you watch movies and shows all day, or 12 if you limit usage to browsing the web on Wi-Fi. And it supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 — the electronics maker said you can expect a full recharge in about three hours, give or take a few minutes. ZenPad 3S 10 Glacier Silver ZenPad 3S 10 Glacier Silver The ZenPad 3S 10 ships running Android Marshmallow 6.0 — no word on when to expect Nougat, unfortunately. One facet of software worth mentioning, though, is system-level stylus support: the ZenPad 10 works with the Asus’s Z Stylus. Another is Asus’s Tru2Life, proprietary tech that the firm said automatically optimizes the “sharpness,” “color,” “brightness,” and “contrast” of video content by analyzing each frame. It’s not new, per say — it’s been a staple on Asus’s Android tablets since at least last year — but the company claims it’s been improved substantially since then. We’ll put that to the test when we manage to get our hands on a test unit. Related: Want a sleek Android Marshmallow tablet for $250? Asus and Verizon may be able to help Asus has yet to announce global availability or pricing, but if the latter is in line with the sticker price in Asus’ home market of Taiwan (TWD 11,000), we’re expecting somewhere around $350. That’s put it within striking distance of Samsung’s Tab S2 — the 9.7-inch model starts at $400. We do know, though, that the ZenPad 10 will ship in two color configurations: silver and grey. We’ve reached out to Asus for all the juicy additional details. Updated on 01-26-2017 by Christian de Looper: Added news of ZenPad 3S 10 LTE launch. Also watch: Share

We know that artificial intelligence is something that will be a part of our future, but now a group of researchers from Stanford are coming out with some exciting things.     The researchers published their findings in the latest issue of Nature this week, training a neural network with 129,450 photos that displayed to the system over 2000 different types of skin conditions. Mixing one of Google's own image recognition algorithms, the researchers trained the neural network to identify both malignant, and benign skin lesions.   The team also worked with 21 human dermatologists, showing the experts the same, common and deadly forms of skin cancer, and asked what treatment they would recommend. Comparing their answer to the AI, the humans performed at the same level. Sebastian Thrun from Stanford's AI Lab wrote in a blog: "We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist. That's when our thinking changed".   One of the most interesting parts of this research, is that the team believes there would be a future where we could have an app on our phones with the AI built in. They said "it will be relatively easy to transition the algorithm to mobile devices", which could lead us onto a path of in-home testing of diseases like cancer.   Susan Swetter, Professor of Dermatology, along with one of the paper's co-authors, said: "rigorous prospective validation of the algorithm is necessary before it can be implemented in clinical practice, by practitioners and patients alike". Andrew Esteva, another co-author, wrote: "Everyone will have a supercomputer in their pockets with a number of sensors in it, including a camera. What if we could use it to visually screen for skin cancer? Or other ailments?" NEWS SOURCES:Mashable.com Recommended for You SpaceX won't attempt landing on their January 30 launch...

The annual income from “the 10% vig,” oops, tax — estimated to be close to $1 trillion by the end of President Barack Obama’s second term — would nearly wipe out the current budget deficit. State and local casino and lottery operations would not affected by the new national legislation. Code named “You Bet Your Ass,” the concept was conceived in a late night drinking and strategy session in May when it seemed obvious to the president’s senior advisors that a second dip of the economy was all but inevitable. As the fifth fifth of Talisker scotch — the current beverage of choice in Washington — was passed around the table, the always mild-mannered chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, slurred the battle cry of the forthcoming campaign: “I’ll give you 10:1 odds that we kick the shit out of those MF’s in 2012.” At that moment, Moshe Peddler, the senior partner of Peddler and Marconi Communications and the president’s outside media maven, felt he had been hit by a thunderbolt. Nevertheless, it took him all night to put the pieces together: that “10:1 odds” phrase, combined with a lifetime of peddling crap, meant federal control and the “taxing” of online gambling. A quick Google search revealed that it was already legal in some major European countries. Internet gambling was coming. The only question was who would control it: the casino operators or Uncle Sam? Today, the Democrats had control of Congress and maybe they could ram it through. After the elections, who knew? Using $200,000 of his company’s political slush funds, Peddler went right to work: grassroots call-ins the next morning to 2,500 radio stations, followed up by in-depth research. That evening, 3,547 land line and cell phone surveys were conducted on two key issues: First, 73% wanted internet gambling; and, second, the public didn’t give a damn who controlled it, as long as they got to play an honest game of Texas Hold? Em. The next morning, Moshe, Rahm and the President sat down for a super secret meeting. Everyone else was banished. Even the secret recording system was shut down. In five minutes, Moshe presented his plan, his research, the preliminary numbers from the budget office and his findings. The chief of staff was so happy he danced on nine fingers. Maybe he would stay the full term after all. The president was another story. Obviously, he’d piss off the religious right and the casino owners. But they were leaning GOP anyway. If Peddler’s numbers were right, he’d come close to wiping out the budget deficit. He figured that plus health care might make him the fifth face on Mt. Rushmore. Peddler read his boss’ face. He was the best closer on the planet, and went in for the kill like Tyson in his prime. “Mr. President, did you know that England and France have already legalized Internet gambling? Denmark has finished its legislation and Germany, Switzerland and Spain are goose-stepping to be next in line. We either try to regulate and tax it, or people are going to go to the offshore operators, where you don’t get any revenue.” The president was sold. “Rahm,” said the now beaming Obama, “alert all the cable and networks for a major address for Sunday at nine. And make sure those budget numbers are right. “Finally, we need a slogan. Something like: Game On.” Bill Regardie was the founder and publisher of Regardie’s Magazine.

Facebook's efforts to help improve its site's interactions with Chrome and Firefox is helping change that. Over the past two years, Facebook’s cooperation with browser vendors Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox has dramatically improved web page reload speeds, according to the company. Working closely with the browsers to squash bugs in the browser caching technique — temporary storage for files downloaded to your computer or mobile device, including html files, CSS style sheets, images, and JavaScript scripts, and other media content — Facebook reduced its page reload times on Chrome by 28 percent. More: Chrome browser will be able to handle FLAC lossless audio in next release As Google’s senior software engineer Takashi Toyoshima notes in his blog post, page validation requests between browsers and web servers can cause serious performance issues on mobile devices, such as battery drain. At the onset of its research, Facebook found that Chrome was sending page validation requests at three times the rate of other browsers. Although this process didn’t result in any additional data being transferred to the user’s device, it was deemed a futile technique that was bogging down page refresh times. Once Chrome simplified its reload behavior to only validate the main resource on a page, it resulted in 60 percent less validation requests. “Every time a user logged in to Facebook the [Chrome] browser ignored its cache and revalidated all the previously downloaded resources,” said Facebook Code team members Ben Maurer and Nate Schloss in a blog post. Referring to the broader impact of the change on websites, Toyoshima said: “We hope this faster reload will come in handy whenever you want to get the latest content on your favorite website or quickly recover from a flaky connection in the subway.” Testing out the change on mobile with a 3G connection, the Chrome team found that the reload rate was 1.6 seconds faster across all websites. Similarly, Firefox implemented a cache-control feature on the most recent version of its browser on the back of a Facebook proposal. The change saw a reload generate just 25 network requests from a Facebook page, which can typically contain around 150 different resources. According to Patrick McManus, principal engineer at Mozilla Firefox, the change cut page reloading times in half. McManus adds that other developers are adopting the feature too, with the BBC revealing that page refresh times have improved by 50 percent. Facebook claims that the research conducted with Chrome and Firefox “highlights how web browsers can, and do, work with web developers to make the web better for everyone.” Also watch: Share

Finance Search Porn 'tube' sites threaten children and actors, critics sayBy Laurence THOMANN, Fiachra GIBBONS | AFP – 13 hours ago Related Content View Photo Documentary maker and former porn star Ovidie says the pirating of videos on to free-to-view websites means fewer films are made and fees have been slashed A new documentary claims that pornography has got "uglier and nastier", with actors forced to shoot more hardcore films for less since the explosion of free-to-view internet sites like Youporn and Pornhub. "Pornocracy", made by Ovidie, a former French porn star turned director, claims that far fewer films are now being made and fees have been slashed up to 10-fold. She blames "tube" sites -- so-called because they resemble YouTube -- which have been accused of hosting thousands of videos pirated from traditional adult entertainment companies. Critics say children are also getting their first exposure to sex through the sites. And they worry about the effect porn culture is having on the way teenage boys treat girls. "Tubes" are also blamed for making porn consumption so commonplace that last week London's transport system was forced to warn that people who watched porn on buses and trains would be reported to the police. Children's campaigner Marie Derain, an advisor to the French women and families minister, said the exploitive nature of "tube" sites was extremely worrying. "Their economic model goes beyond even what is at stake in terms of pornography," she told AFP. - Nearly all pirated - Gregory Dorcel, who heads Marc Dorcel, Europe's third-biggest adult entertainment group, said 95 percent of the 100 billion porn clips watched on the web last year were pirated. His company alone has made five million requests to Google for its videos to be taken down from "tubes". "But 48 hours later the videos are back online," Ovidie said. Her documentary claims that a little-known company called MindGeek -- headquartered in "an empty office" in Luxembourg -- is now porn's most powerful player, holding a monopoly-like grip on the industry. But MindGeek, which prefers to be seen as a tech company, and makes no reference to porn on its website, told AFP that it operates only four "tube" sites -- Pornhub, Youporn, RedTube and Tube8. "Claims that we dominate the industry are nonsense," a spokeswoman said, saying that only three of its sites ranked in the top 10 of the world's most visited adult sites. Pornhub alone, however, is the 11th most viewed site in the US, just behind Wikipedia, Twitter and Instagram. MindGeek says it is simply a platform for its "1,000 content partners that upload content and benefit from the exposure on our sites". "There is lot of misinformation about how tube sites function," the spokeswoman said. She said it followed YouTube's lead on "managing the issue of copyrights". "There is no room in our model for the assumption that content is pirated," she added. She claimed instead that they had "formed positive, symbiotic relationships with most of the major players in the industry". Many traditional adult film makers dispute this, also complaining that while they are subject to strict regulations on age, the "tubes" can easily be viewed by children. - Kids see porn by 11 - The French pressure group Ennocence, which is trying to make regulation of the "tubes" an issue in the country's coming presidential election, said children now tend to first view porn at 11. Its president, Gordon Choisel, said they were being bombarded with adult images through internet adverts from a very young age. "You think your child is watching a cartoon but then a window pops up with porn," he said. Choisel said governments had to attack the sites' advertising streams. "We have to come up with legislation that is flexible enough to adapt to changes in technology and the way videos are being watched," he said. Derain, author of a 2012 report on children's viewing habits, said porn was shaping many young people's view of sex. "Sexuality in real life is not like that," she said, but children who have grown up watching "tubes" have trouble making the distinction. "I have been involved in a number of very serious criminal cases where boys have systematically done to girls what they saw on porn," she said. "Pornocracy" also dealt with the explosion in "cam girl" sites and what Ovidie termed the "new proletariat of sex" who work long hours on them. She said the women get only around 15 percent of what their clients pay to watch them perform online. Up to 70 percent goes to such platforms, including Live Jasmin, also based in Luxembourg, which has annual revenue of more than $300 million and has made its owner, Gyorgy Gattyan, Hungary's second-richest man, according to Forbes magazine. But Marton Fulop, the operations director at Live Jasmin, which is often called the "peep show Uber", justified the amounts paid to its two million registered cam girls, saying it was a tech company "that provided a very good platform".

PHOTO: REUTERS WASHINGTON: The FBI appeared to go beyond the scope of existing legal guidance in seeking certain kinds of internet records from Twitter as recently as last year, legal experts said, citing two warrantless surveillance orders the social media company published on Friday. Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet’s Google and Yahoo. Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. Zuckerberg says US government threat to Internet The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo’s guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. “While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the US Department of Justice,” Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. Govt surveillance: Investigative reporters think US spies on them “This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended,” said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of last year the US Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

PHOTO: REUTERS Microsoft Corp’s market capitalization topped $500 billion for the first time since 2000 on Friday, after the technology giant’s stock rose following another quarter of results that beat Wall Street’s expectations. Shares of the world’s biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bill Gates could become world’s first trillionaire Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple Inc’s market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet Inc’s market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts’ average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company’s profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street’s expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company’s efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. Microsoft victory in overseas data privacy case stands When he took the top job in February 2014, the company’s stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it “buy” or higher, eight have a “hold” rating and two “strong sell”.

One witness even recorded a footage of the mysterious lights hovering in the sky over Texas. Rachel Jensen, a resident of East Austin, called Austin 311 after witnessing and recording mysterious lights flying in the sky over her home, as reported by Fox7 Austin. “I believe they were UFOs,” Jensen said. “By the time they actually got here, it’s like they went up and then took off. The speed of them was so fast,” Rachel added. Austin resident says she spotted UFO's https://t.co/i9vFtWT0nz pic.twitter.com/GfBBjYNzrK — FOX 7 Austin (@fox7austin) January 25, 2017 Jensen said that her roommate noticed three lights coming towards their direction. Shocked by what he saw, the roommate urged Jensen to go outside to check it out. The three lights seemed to form a triangle formation, she said. “Just as I stepped out, I looked to the sky and saw the triangle. Just as it was separating into three. Well there was one in the front and two behind it. They were bright orange, glowing, almost fiery,” said Jensen. Amazingly, a fourth light emerged to join the three already hovering in the sky, moving back and forth in an erratic manner, said Jensen. In every UFO report is the possibility of a hoax, but Jensen’s report gained credibility as the American Meteor Society confirmed that they have also received sighting reports over Austin.. They said that at least five people have seen a fireball hovering in the sky over Louisiana and Texas on that same night. Christopher V. Sherman, a photographer for OverAustin.com, also captured a stunning photo showing streaks of light in the sky over Austin on Monday night. Last night's mystery lights update @fox7austin says @amsmeteors received reports too https://t.co/XhIuh3sI2c #ufo #aliens #austintx pic.twitter.com/YIAgwKbSmt — Over Austin (@overatx) January 25, 2017 The photo shows beautiful downtown Austin, and on the right can be seen a long streak of light curving over the horizon just behind a tree. A smaller streak of light can be seen to the left as well. The photo was reportedly captured around the same time Jensen saw UFOs in the sky over Austin. Jensen was heartened over learning that she wasn’t the only one who saw the mysterious lights in the sky. “You know sometimes you see things and you’re like, what was it? Well, this time it was like, somebody else saw it. Like I said, I’m excited to see what it was,” she said. The UFO sightings over Texas have been reported just around the time an Englishman who calls himself “John Mooner” claimed that he has irrefutable evidence that aliens attempted to abduct him. As previously reported by Complex, Mooner says that Google satellites captured the specific moment when aliens tried to abduct him. Identifying himself as a ufologist, he claimed numerous times that he had encounters with extraterrestrial beings in the past. The self-proclaimed UFO expert told Torquay Herald Express that he stumbled on the evidence while trying to use the Google Earth app on his computer. “I was having trouble with the Google Earth app that was installed on my computer so I looked for an online option and found Google satellite maps,” Mooner said. “I thought to myself I will view the area where I was UFO spotted from last year and look for anything out of the ordinary. I was left speechless by what I saw. The satellite has captured a real alien abduction taking place.” Ridiculous as Mooner’s claim may sound, UFO reports that offer compelling evidence should be taken seriously, especially in light of the recent news that the CIA shared top secret documents that may prove aliens exist. As reported by Mirror, the CIA released declassified documents that may reveal more information about many UFO sightings reported in the past.

Carscoops Your daily scoop in automotive news About Contact RSS Social Media HOME NEW CARS SPIED CONCEPTS FUTURE CARS VIDEO GAMES OFFBEAT BRANDS TUNING REVIEWS Tesla Sues Ex-Autopilot Director Claiming He Stole Company Secrets | By Brad Anderson | ShareRedditPinTweetPlus Tesla has sued the former director of its Autopilot program suggesting that he stole confidential information from the automaker to use in his own startup. The company alleges that Sterling Anderson stole company information and intended on using it for a new autonomous car venture, Aurora Innovation, he founded with Chris Urmson, the former head of Google’s self-driving project. In the lawsuit, Tesla asks for a court order to stop Anderson, Urmson and Aurora Innovation from hiring any Tesla employees and contractors from one year after Anderson left the electric carmaker. Additionally, the firm wants an order to block the use of its proprietary information for autonomous driving systems. The suit goes on to specify that Anderson downloaded “hundreds of gigabytes of Tesla’s confidential and proprietary information” onto a personal hard drive and intended on using it for his own autonomous startup. While speaking with Bloomberg however, Anderson viciously denied the accusations saying “Tesla’s meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition. “This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business,” he said. Alongside seeking injunctive relief barring any Tesla employees joining Aurora, Tesla is seeking compensatory damages for prejudgement interest and any other relief the court may deem acceptable.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo By Dustin Volz | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON The FBI appeared to go beyond the scope of existing legal guidance in seeking certain kinds of internet records from Twitter as recently as last year, legal experts said, citing two warrantless surveillance orders the social media company published on Friday. Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet's Google and Yahoo. Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo's guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. "While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice," Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. "This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended," said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of last year the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

Albritton   Gregory Calliste, CEO, Wodhull Hospital. Gregory Calliste, new CEO of Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center (Woodhull), has been making his rounds within Woodhull’s service area to introduce himself and impress the point that “Woodhull should be your choice”.   Calliste’s appointment became effective April 11, 2016.  He was the acting CEO for North Central Bronx Hospital prior to coming to Woodhull.  He holds a Master of Science in Public Health from Columbia University and a MBA from the New York Institute of Technology.  His predecessor at Woodhull is George Proctor, who retired from NYC Health + Hospitals after 33 years of service.   Woodhull’s service coverage contains Bushwick, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Fort Greene.  During a visit to Brooklyn Community Board No. 3’s (CB3) general meeting, June 6, 2016, Calliste talked to the attending community residents and other dignitaries.   He said, “Woodhull is one of the best-kept secrets in Brooklyn and one of the best-performing hospitals in the City of New York.”  Though not stating his source, Calliste affirmed “all of the organizations that rate hospitals give Woodhull between A’s and B’s”.  Some sources would counter the assertion.   Social media gives people the platform to rate Woodhull.  Google reviews average 2.6 stars out of a possible five-star rating from 138 reviews.  Yelp reviews average 1.5 stars out of a possible five-star rating from 104 reviews.   Woodhull’s Spring 2016 safety score from HospitalSafetyScore.org is “B”.  This website is created and administered by The Leapfrog Group, which is an independent, nonprofit “committed to driving quality, safety and transparency in the U.S. health system”.  This B is comprised of the average score from MRSA infection (0.188 above average), C. diff infection (0.743 above average), Infection in the Blood during ICU stay (1.148 below average), Infection in the Urinary Tract during ICU stay (1.352 below average) and Surgical Site Infection after colon surgery (not available).   US News and World Report’s 2015-16 Analysis of Hospitals uses the “high-performing”, “average” and “below average” rating system.  This annual ranking is done in July and uses statistics from the American Hospital Association’s Annual Survey Database.   Woodhull gets an “Average in medical procedures and conditions of COPD; an Average in medical procedures and conditions of Heart Failure; Unrated due to insufficient volume in Hip Replacement and Unrated due to insufficient volume in Knee Replacement.”   Woodhull’s specialty is in the treatment of Nephrology.  The hospital’s performance in this area is 41.8/100.  “Its reputation with other doctors in this specialty as surveyed in 2013, 2014 and 2015 named as best is 0.0%.  However, its rating for Patient Survival 30 Days after admission is 7/10, or better than expected, and 5/5, or high in Patient Safety.”   These middling scores can be attributed to insufficient nursing staff and lack of advance technologies, “0.8 and 1/7”, respectively.   However, Lynn Schulman, Senior Associate Executive Director of Woodhull’s Business Affairs unit, substantiates Calliste’s assertions by pointing to the medical center’s full accreditation by the Joint Commission; its receipt of the 2016 Health Grades Patient Safety Award and Gold Plus status for the American Heart Association’s Get With the Guidelines Heart Failure Program.  Schulman includes receipt of the Health Equality Index for equitable care of LGBT patients and their families as an important milestone.   A statement within Calliste’s short address at CB3’s June 2016 general meeting that pricked some ears is, “As the community changes, we want to make sure Woodhull improves so people don’t have to leave Brooklyn and go all the way to New York”.   “Community change” is seen as a bitter pill to take for some who reside in Williamsburg, Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Fort Greene.  For them, “community change” has meant transforming “Brownstone Brooklyn” into “High-Rise Brooklyn” by assembling adjacent building lots for demolition to make way for denser, multistory apartment buildings.  “Community change” has meant demographic changes and higher rents and mortgages.  Some area residents may ask, “Does improvement in hospital services require these community changes as impetus?”   “What Mr. Calliste was referring to was that as the community changes, it is the hospital’s responsibility to assess the health care needs of the community on a regular basis and offer the services that address those needs so individuals can lead their healthiest lives,” explained Ms. Schulman.   To its credit, Woodhull serves its wide service area not only from the medical and mental health center at 760 Broadway, it has the Cumberland Diagnostic and Treatment Center, four community health centers, six child health clinics and two school-based health centers.  It is affiliated with Langone Medical Center and these associated facilities provide services six days out of the week.   Soon to open is affordable and supportive housing located at 179 Throop Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  This construction project is a six-story ADA compliant residential building containing 89 studios, 53 units are designated for recently released psychiatric patients and 36 units for tenants making 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI), or $36,300 for a single person.  The monthly rent for the units is $907. Community-based health and housing provider Comunilife will provide on-site services.   While Woodhull’s rating as one of the best hospitals in Brooklyn is debatable, getting “good” ratings is honorable.  It is the status that gives room for improvement while receiving commendations for service.  Perhaps, Gregory Calliste, COO-turned-acting-CEO at North Central Bronx Hospital, will work to continuously improve the quality of care for all residents in the catchment area regardless of socioeconomic status.

They're really and Iceland today from a Michael Quigley whose history teacher by alma mater in Rhode Island bishop Hendrick and and a two page letter really really not overwhelming. About me and show and NEI general victory and he is of everybody here at the station was one of vacuum mr. prickly. Very very much appreciated and have to do that they really really appreciated and to all my Hough supporters out there. In a war port island always a peculiar as 61777979376177797937. I was waiting for the stupid bets to come out you know on Mardy lost mayor bosses is going to but there are. There's one nuggets would at some point and there is a NASCAR better out there between New Hampshire and Atlanta. And I'll tell you what it is a little bit later robber like you go over the public phone calls here Tyrell poll. Are patriots a former patriots defensive backs contributed 25 for a few minutes he's down in the Atlanta area. He has a great prospective viewers on the patriots Super Bowl winning teams of 0405. When they beat. You know when he beat the Houston game when they don't they beat Carolina in Houston Andy Pete. Vehicles. In Jacksonville what he was best known for. There really be 032 we started with with Ty Law both of them a defensive back in your Rodney Harrison there as well and obviously Tom Brady Deion Branch complete Daniel Graham Rupert you're tied and remember him. Kind of kind of goes on. He brings him up it will be a real good season it's what 77797. Under 37 back to forge Rico Jefferies and Burlington appear WI Jamie. Hey hey don't tonight. I'm doing pretty good that I get that two parts to talk about serve this is the patriot system. Number one you've got to nailed it. About our ten minutes earlier when he's deadly journalist. Wait you're all stupid journal right away that this these these these journalists these analysts that are claiming that it access this stuff. They they they just don't mean they don't have that that their job they don't have the ability to sell stuff for powered. You know segment that they'd split the two worst article one hours segment that they actually app. More than 92 segment that they have some time some analysts are not that FL network and ESP airedale you also the same thing it's one gigantic broken record. Because they know they ate there they can't figure it out it's just discipline. And the way it's that's the way they do things around there were able to change on the fly and all three phases. You're absolutely right you know and and that and and the access is not above all. Theory that the patriot dirt that then take a look at Brady career you know Alan and I can break it up and liked it it he's got like. Four different. Quarter of his career. This person or four years was a dink and not short app that was that old that won't work and got that a person how they act. Many enter in 2007. And we get pretty much all of a sudden. You know pride and everybody like Ricky who are all Ollie doesn't short in Canada call absolute. I would intend it. Anybody knowing about even then though Jamie I know if it even that you go back through old you know even 23456. He was throwing a lot of the pass at that stopper soul is under you know I'd people I think to stab. I got that the fans but the media has such short memory of some other. Do you go back to the Super Bowl in Houston against Carolina. But the last drive what he did some of those bullet passes to branch those Arctic elbows weren't they conduct that I don't you know that as a lot of other apple they don't realize goes a lot of people don't realize. Even a one there're couple games he's fling the ball all over the place for people have short memories. Yeah you're right so you don't then you enter into the second part is it's the Randy Mott deep ball a guy in strike. Didn't really must lead we go to a two tight end. System where we got it. You know we got crop we got another guy that amount bring up that you know these young we don't expect I am so he lead now back one tight end and all of a sudden you're you know. Now tonight that's sort of where we are right now we got Hogan and we got a deep threat again and all of a sudden he's chuck the ball the outfielder didn't agriculture again. Stroke you know if you wanna say our system is we win because we utilized our players and our current roster to the best of their ability that's what we do now. Absolutely Ryan absolutely. And ups are sergeant Jamie and no doubt about it rides in a car Dexter on WEEI want to talk about. Whatever the system thing is I I don't know ride. Yet later that recall pleasant when. Well I think it left collar kind of hit the nail on the head Mars. Being a lot of turnover with the weapons grade. And these guys. As battery recruit her set of skills and different backgrounds but as far as that goes. I do think Gary something career and there is one correctly at every guy who had come through new England and pick up whatsoever. It all share in common. It's being able to get on the syndicated Brady Natalie. And that. You know being milk the reader defense NCA exactly how he. And being able you know fitness don't exactly add onto it Hewitt or stand your route I mean. You know. He got a certain things that he excelled at more than others and short in intermediate throws he had on the middle of the field. Not turning the ball over. Older than ever in order offence. Since he became the starter. But really that's why you guys who they're not the biggest you're not professor in the strongest but. They know what bring you want to view intellectually. Baking plant came up with telecheck and that's why I think you guys who aren't athletic marble. And what what you can't count in the same actually. Has some merit and the Julian winds coming off a career year he didn't get any next entry agency. Only one other teams entered the scope was even interact in himself. I think to a point it is accurate it's more well that'll lead what you cannot her. Tom Brady as opposed to. You know what you critically. I know I think he does make a log your points I think also that elements agent had broad cracked no intentions of having Julian go anywhere. Our besides stay here I mean Richard player Collin Capra that door. Our you know whoever was wherever wherever it is I think Julien is Smart enough to know that this is his meal ticket. Stay here with this team and he really doesn't even if he's very under appreciated. As you get that the attack of slot. Receiver like Welker did it and others and I I just think it's unfair. He's he's a wide receiver one of the best in the NFL. As a seventh round pick at Kent State and I went to Penn State play quarterback beaming over. The towards efforts at a seven night 7037. Shaw's and what's up next here on WEEI shot. Earlier period I don't you do on a lark I love your pageantry. Than you appreciate the try. I would hope you'll ever saw. The total book. All right Bob Ballard checked yes when you Kurt started. Being at her coat back in the ninety's Cleveland yup they're good friend Jimmy Johnson who we all know it yet altered coach. Look at him uncertain. They'll. You can't coach stupid. When it comes to the draft Eric go to get players. Are callable or reset. Now about the trap as the most let it. You've got a jets Smart people Smart people won't win trio candidate they'd pick. Can comprehend everything you're gonna eat out here out without regard to run repeats it you can understand abort all what matter. Smart people pay you to check coached corporate. A lie I agree ended and two it two of the other point Toobin Bill Parcells bay where he was here he said you know I'm too old to coach idiots. You know ardent and so I'm sure you know bill knew that as well but yeah at apps absolutely say they don't tolerate. Very. It out there than to try to Michael Floyd situation not he had one good game. You know and if you don't. Did that play that you eat that catchy sure against Houston. That's right I don't they tell you may have seen the last to Michael for less open happens as we can practice some tweaks something out of you see Michael Floyd again he's. Here's LT stretchers brought in for a couple of games when he really needed another body in there. Don't get a Super Bowl wearing if they win it but. If you. For lack of rewards scorn Tom Brady and some of these we've seen it before people do what he watcher to do. You get like 12 chance and that's it after that. Sometimes you get no second chances he will just not going to vote total was groat who guys who go with the elements Emma dole is. All in such as the way that's just the way you the years and always always going to be that way. There is Daryn in a car next here on WEEI this theory got a system this system. Well you know. I think we all agree that it's it's not just one thing and I Obama but very very short my point very very short which would you agree that. The patriots are successful because they are set up connected things short parts forming a more complex poll. Well I think it's if that translates into through your job yet but I what I think is. What other people with systems don't have as the ability or the arrogance or ignorance or just stupidity not to be able to change on the fly. So if things aren't going well for the patriots and all three phases of the game they usually make the correction usually the right one that's what other teams don't get. Blunt saying that these debt to Miriam Webster's definition the system is just that upset connected things. That's former complex hole in one of those things like the space and exchange that the ability to change. That's yeah that. That is not picked exclusive look assessed top. So I agree you are the there's a lot more but just by definition a system change is inherent in the. Yeah edited the promised Daryn like guys like Dan lever tarred and Colin Cowherd. And others and the key Shawn Johnson just as it's been throwing that word out. With this team that phrase double the patriots for years now over a well into you know 6717. Years ago today by the winnable Belichick was fired by the patriots. But that role that phrase out here because they can't figuring out. And it's really really that it they can't figured out because they refuse to criticize other coaches and other players. To a degree. You hear all the time especially coaches on other coaches it is embarrassing. How they refuse on ESPN NFL network to criticize. Other Brothers out there they're coaching Brothers are out there. And so it brought the works system and it's so transparent. Isaacson Lawrence up next here on WEEI Isaak. Yes hello little eyes adore you. I yell at us so all I know I have to make a disclosure I am not up that's when I am a giant brand that. I don't know what you're so what's the giants' system I'd like to giants' system. The report Democrat whatever my soul on people sip on water arguing that so but what all that being. My god we have an operating system. Microsoft monopoly of sure. What are all the bad economy at night you'd want always questioned the system mandate but it works in all all about art and people wanna get. And outlook some. Auburn to a top procurement coworkers and again. That's what works and emotion on the play good desirable quality wanna see operational that you know they have big and small change that but I wanna see the human emotion after the first out I wanna see it. When did the play at all take place after you court shall about abortion but. What sort of fact the opposite the lead role as the system worked and what it apart. Well look look at it because this is the heat beat the jobs you just brought up you know at the like I said you go in your shaft is a system Microsoft there's a system there's this. There's a lot of jobs. Factory jobs there is a system might get it in the NFL beast an analyst throw I don't care what team you're talking about. But you'll hear the system thrown out there regarding the patriots went last time someone said about Eli Manning and company win lose or draw. Talked about quote unquote the system. You know big I mean they've been I mean that's the thing what what is the system of the giants the system is trying to score touchdowns product try to prevent the other team scored touchdowns. Talk about top off was able to adjust on the fly if things didn't work correctly you know that's you. And that's at at at if you wanna refer to the system that's what you troubleshoot Unita to make you troubleshoot because of something about work you adjust and I mean like I can't I have done has China which would inspect. Well I raised you and I do have to I mean I laughed tool. Compliment and I do have to recognize that you know if you wanna go to sip compliant but if the system would not work if you replace it but at the system didn't quite an important. Keep golf would it up and does not the fault of the system work quote unquote you know. Yeah absolutely and he and you go about it that it thanks a lot Isaak a call Eddie you go back to 2001. And on that Sunday night game the patriots play the rams it was their last loss of the season and they were five and for the loss a game five by the that was the rest of the way. Most of you go to. But the system that night they play the rams very tough. That pick six from a throughout puck clearly in that game and there isn't. Don't they played reasonably well they beat up the ramp to the rams lost the next week in March the first thing on his mouth was wow we just physically abused by patriots and and and they weren't the only team that your bet that said that but. What the patriots did in that game. Compared to the Super Bowl defensively. Night and day. Night and day so the system change from week ended the NFL to the super ball. What 68 weeks later nine weeks eight weeks there's only one there's only wasn't a week off in between that year because of 9/11. But so that's what I'm talking about you go back and watch those abused eleven games on on film you go back to Los. The second half the 2001 regular season game when it lost to the ramp at the close camp and go back to see. How much different their defense changed against. Off blocking company in the Super Bowl martz and and and everybody else that night and day. Because they adjusted. I got into the system. The came with a better scheme to beat the rams that's what they want. Jim to sever sort of a next here on WEEI hey Jim. Eight at this restoration work hard core patriot in about the all the asking for forty years and 52. And I can tell you that you know wherever you go. The patriots are considered cheaters. In this year you would think it would get indication in the super ball. And you know the NFL VP really seeing you know the results of testing the four walls on every game they haven't done any of that. And you think there were viewed civil suit. Or roller slander suit. By the crap the Himalayan instead we see pictures. Like on WEEI dot com. Oh crap. Applicable. Currently. Do enjoy that and last year you know on the sideline chemical and that's after the speech crack. So. You know there's an acute question market because they're definitely damaged the reputation of that scene in even if they win the super ball. People looking you know big and they're gonna go all are they gonna feel like you know they courts didn't cheat there. But okay what about the rams. You know Super Bowl and you know me Jeannie and all of act crack in the applicant get into. On budget doesn't it Jim you're right it's gonna they can win the next ten years in a row went back to back to back to back. All the way down for decades and it's not gonna matter such as say embrace it not tied to stand frustration about the craft stuff but. Look it's it's that they want their cake and eat it too I get that. Do you watch the party got to build. Out. If you would be ordered it seems. In his Buick candidates gear franchise would damage that much. You will press wacko lots. Other you know what Kerry can't Jim I've I've I'm I'm 99.9 percent sure because thanks for popular talk about this with. Bob McGovern of Boston Herald. We did a great job. And and other legal analyst and they cannot I believe they cannot. By law files slander lawsuit because of this against against the league. Because of the bylaws and use of all that stuff put. It's what 777 I 70937. All part beach shepherd experience it's a tense Sports Radio WEEI. They have done plenty of wrong. Plenty of content what I want what aplenty Iraq. Well I mean it taped games at third coach was fine more than any coach in the history of the league for what it is that he was doing against the wall joint. He was filming whatever it is that he was filming Mary what is using he was breaking the rule. The wall only wanna. I objection your honor to facts not in evidence building whatever he was filming. It I think it I think by the the that was an overreaction though. But that's bad that's bad that's neither here or there. Nobody doubting that. They got behind for that. I am I mean ten liver tarred how could be such a Bobble head and have a show like that. And then defend yourself. Oh my god I mean just don't ever attempted to our fellow what they were probably don't need to weren't sport has no idea. What he's talking about zero. None. As to the rest of those there was some of what I just keep throwing out crap. More more more garbage. More lies. Out there. It's unbelievable between Leavitt tarred and collar edge Shannon Sharpe and and Keyshawn Johnson. And I. So audio others across ESPN that FL network who don't even know all what's spy gate was they don't even know. They dished waking up stop about the page of tape and locked roost or practices. From 2001 of the FBI and had to apologize for. And these Bobble heads up there a most networks just hopes that nonsense. We director Paul calls just the second gonna head to the AT&T hotline right now though a check of our first guest tonight former patriot defensive back. At Super Bowl we're a tie it rolled pool joins a WEEI deprived. A Fort Valley State LaGrange Georgia good evening Tyrone Power usurped. They gave the thank you better be off. It seems like yesterday you and tied in Eugene and Rodney and that defensive back row ironically of course deadly end. In Houston of always relied feel then that switch and switch corporate dazed by it doesn't seem like that long ago. You know why it and did it. It. All you'd see if you look at the calendar need to get 20172003. But when you actually probably. I guess get internal clock. He gains and you hear the advertisement on television it seems like you're yesterday. What made that team so special your mind. I think I think we basically. Must have company and our 2003. I got you know people it was the first time that I ever was a part of the team bad eutectic can't prior to the Guinea. And get the aura of family. Every one depended on each other and Ethiopian individual. And everybody is doing their job. Would deal and that alone topical. Before it became a real slogan. The years past I just a few years ago put. I get the family get in particular did. I get offended what I hear these people I've been written about for the last two hours about these lazy reporters who just throughout the word the system the phrase the system. They don't to a Freddie of a team they do it for the patriots now let me ask you. Exactly what it because I think there's no system it's a fact of being professional and actually learning the playbook. Doing your job and the ability to adjust on the fly whether it's series to series or game to game. Whatever it is what this bill when people throw out the word the phrase that's system regarding the patriots does that bother you. No it doesn't know it and any tap it once they detonated it took to vote you can't use when someone else is about system okay. But there is also good to sit that would depend on the patriots have actually accomplished they've accomplished our multiple Super Bowl and it got you win it. People want China's space company but it got so once hit a super Egypt at about corporate America OP take Microsoft. I the year he'd take home people take Coca-Cola. OK they have a system. I'm pretty sure they do do they go about. Is that Professional League yet they do they hire the right employees go to one of the company. Yes they do the patriots do the same thing. They are eight. What's it a hundred company date if they could be traded or these. New York Stock Exchange people would hit there in the New England Patriots let. A team record that you have those who don't outside and they want to we. So they're Batman and so they have to pick somebody whom the biggest bear on the block so to speak to talk about some of them are here. It doesn't make me any different I don't hear people say that because I know in this world you have to have a system in order to when he if you wanna. If you are a little. And you wanna payable to buy out you have to have a system in which you. Bringing to the table of people watching duke beat Google so the pages in the differently than any other what you found. But isn't it more about I agree through to lose that point it's more about you know a mindset here as opposed to. You know at some of these big corporations yes the ever system and they are the good ones will be able to adjust and adapt to things are going well whether B marketing or. Or product what whatever it is but I want but I would get me ties that. Is is that of the phrase the system is never thrown out there are people on the espionage and a phone network. Regarding any of the team. You don't hear it we don't with the Packers like. Right Aaron Rodgers for two weeks and he's a great quarterback don't get me wrong weather but OK so whether the green based system last week as opposed to the previous two weeks I mean happen. The system. It at that Iraqis see it this group of people. I get the word that you're trying to say is what people think pray they say oh he's ready. Now that diet comes with two definitions activate diet didn't. Are prepared me here so I'm looking at they sit them I think that was the bid. The patriots head out that nobody else could duplicate. And regardless if you player football would be Green Bay Packers if they're trapped the ball twenty yards. All the way to the opponent end zone. There had to be a bit of a play you have to be called. And it'll happen updated patriots day start from the top with Robert Kraft. A corporate media and the ability realizes that hey it got knows where he's too so I am going to lay back and let him out. Do where coaches do Oedipus who. You have some owners desperate immediate I want my hand it irritated cool at all so the work that really doesn't stop at all. It in a debate is about. Good gas talk about football. Leavitt got knocked on the football field. Get by the draft. Pick again there are more dead make you Alter the deepest. Do what you try to do which school what we are Super Bowls and desolate pages had done and I think that got hit bottom line eight you ought when he compared. You don't use single producer people are obligated when he first automated people were like oh yes using bulk. Now he began to dominate okay he must be taken property to go back. Pope at his feet bagel look you don't teach so it. It being here we go out and got whacked out level but pictures badly they are badly no matter what you see him outside is that we believe or yes side. A good luck. There was big with Tyrone Poole former defensive back thirteen year priority or fell one a couple of Super Bowls and when the patriots threats of bars would look injury wise and fortunately but still we'll always remember your your router tolerable that. Great defense about a great defense you know not just that the bat the defensive back for with you when Ty Law. And and Eugene and Rodney but Mike Vrabel Roman Phifer Tedy Bruschi Macinnis Steve I mean god that would tell me. How does this current patriot team this year compare. I what do you like about it and the same characteristics. Compare contrast former your Super Bowl winning team at that one in Houston in this one. Well I think our word. Talk about outback Ian to get a beer. That particular year we won it in so. We played a lot of making it to me. And I picture win in the unit and I'm Mike Vrabel at. It is bruised ego get listen. Desolate lot that we wanna do and I think the second period that we added that Rodney. Each you know being in the enforcer and are Eugene. Do you expect there. Do what is being free safety I think. In my mind. That we probably at my best secondaries an Oak Creek. That had been in the league that these gas here at your anger. Personal. And nothing definite advantage for these. Patriot secondary they're personally they can cover. They may not be a peek at the camp Chatham that. These gat. I theaters on Big Apple will become an update is made up blood. You can cover on the corners of the state the it for an alternate. The court you have Tom bear in. You know get when people ask me about him they play wit made him so. What I got their old re outcome came out two of the a couple of cannot look at a lot of particulates are exactly. Warming a he would act. What is that Merkel. Now it got company with the deepest look out normally you know. It'll failed bid alternate path near term to bill ended because it has yet to what Tom economy and ended up. Some parents would be so that's how he played on the football Heatley is would have been if it mentality but he's playing at all so. But there are a lot of similarities and W gasket he's. Traditional player who each other and issue one taking. All season long or at least most the second half you're hearing from the national idiots. That there on the page it's ever played in only quarterback OK statistically true or right they had Russell Wilson who beat them obviously in Foxboro they had Palmer the first game of the season which they beat him. Some people forget about Joseph Flacco I guess is on the lead quarterback anymore some people's minds as the patriots they'll beat him through with the number one defense that they had at the time. But would this that would that's sticking your craw. You know at least delegated to the Steelers I mean but all season long. Page Tuesday president more scoring defense in the league but they haven't played anybody as the deep back if you were on this team right now. Would that bother you or simply be typical patriot just block out the noise. I didn't block got in the everything at the distraction they're they're distract you choppy day. You got to compete legal went out there week in and week out and they are. And regardless whether well the go back being batted places you know. It could lead Jack. They would be an uphill they would not an act especially if you start the being this separate race I guess in most general public. Opinion is. It numbers if you have a patent numbers that you are in the gap where you could take eight. Greta quarterback UK Robert greed and if he throws back the house the yard yet he now is an elite quarterback. But he's always been the quarterback because he had ski so I think sometimes they get. Should be based company numbers each week sixteen weeks between games they actually are playing and you lead. Quarterbacks so director determines where the public considers the leak. But it all this into deep. Is he beat it also I could go back to talk about the ability to play it up I go back to when he was with the Dutch guy as deep as the coordinator. And you got keep up a look at a lot of it up bill that would stop and they show segment where they were cut by the Dutch guy when he came to bookmobile. That he'll talk about his Jeanne. Op approach to regain. He wants to litigate in any type of fashion debt they have to do would pages app do well I remembered being interviewed and the New York Giants. Because a lot and not allow a 100 yard rusher all game. If he would be okay in the unit told them. You know what gas. In order to win a suitable cargo block loading it take on Egypt or your record and he's here. Whether it be a sold out in order put two minutes to go we will have to allow permit comment to rock over a hundred yards and O'Donnell lack adequate. Most importantly I can't talk to see or we have to sacrifice our individual there's some fortitude. And in order went to bow out I am not so you go at all. But you have to re okay that's a multiple strokes he does a great group trying to say he would heed of a great job he's been doing it every few years and industrial. Well compared to heed. The players to go out and you've got it include positions and so is it doesn't matter where he say. You know the patriots have a great organization great coach great clips. Are you come out of Fort Valley State which more people around a win win before you got a private went where the hell is that. I've been you know you're a first round pick I think what 22 row overall. I read an absolutely an amazing story I know you worth what Carolina Indian Denver for you can do to patriots said. Had good seasons a lot of a lot of good seasons but wanna shoot the ball here but. It I'll ask you a guy like Malcolm but we're you gonna have a soft Spartan in your heart for him a guy coming out of west Alabama nobody knew. Anything's a bottom I'm sure a much like yourself coming out of Fort Valley State so is that a fair analogy. Yeah you go all the small school. The only difference between in a your state or a university Georgia island university pick it up. And I think god did they ask to see your gold at a combat. So I killed. You know is all about we come at a house is all about. Go wanted to college and started your freshman year that we you wanna start cute bleached the Karl. How does it blew it say it if you make him play. Article at science I'm liking world where he Beckett to date so gab now led Malcolm they'd give an opportunity to get going to be other app from. What was that a follow him. That good question is gonna be proposed to him out so yes he may now and all the other small. College of quarters. Bad not that total typical sixth. 1626. Whatever these gas Michelin did a week alone we can place so my hat goes off to Malcolm. I'm pretty sure his rookie year he probably spend a lot of time but he'll beat them. That's why he's plan great ball Lackey clay. It was speak with Tyrone Poole former patriots are cornerback Super Bowl winner of thirteen year veteran Indiana felt it the last. Couple questions several thank you particularly humorous personally boredom my dad's birthday my dad passed what February 3 so you have a soft spot by Hartford for that but. But what. You're living in the you grow up I thought that Fannie living in in Georgia LaGrange Georgia. Yes Bob born and raised in the graduate. Here in Atlanta so. I grew up. Rid of the falcons in Dallas cowboy same Malawi Beckett we eventually into account saying yup you're black cal he's either way Jerry grant field let the your packet Atlanta so I'll let my employer at. Attitude April's became the New England paid oak a kind of toward you know like watching you aren't sure or Alabama younger son plays Auburn. Like you're ready to play what developers like what do you do well that would Turkey deal. Cox. Let you know I feel like. Yeah. Actual wisdom and the game itself. Experience I have to go to the patriots can get you on you know ghostly laughter so. Brett idiot today epic intangibles coach in his turnovers are going to turn it and went suitable. What's the mood down there right now and and they let it area because I've heard some talk show host who were absolutely delusional that they're spewing the same stuff about. Take a practices stuff they don't understand spy gate they don't novice and ought to Google whatever it is that need to. Look up the facts and just throw this stuff out there the patriots cheat and this that it's like lazy real lazy journalism but do you sense that there is Eric overconfidence down there amongst. Falcon fans or just the area itself I mean I know they're happy to be here but we all know. And you Tyrod he can't deny this I mean the Atlanta at the true Atlanta sports fan. Is not taken very seriously. Present company excluded of course but by the rest of the countries that fair. Well I think there isn't an assessment debt people based off slow which is continuous continuous support. There have been years where the falcons and that done whales and the they have support. And travel support explores with the pain. I have not been as hot like New England you know I remember I remember my days everybody can't. We played against Miami Dolphins. It was snow him W that gave an agent at the one thing to do about that you remember it. If they had been played a song is ample notice no air raid. You know it is cold out there in the air it feels sold out. Sometimes you don't eat up falcons at the time that they would not do a whale you know that this support was that gas so from that they have what athlete you know people look at it put and say did you go to Spain and this day that B area. Sporting. Territory Brett I do believe that they are beginning to pass topic. New creator something new here I can't. In the trop pioli Reagan bad. Or run that system actually one from New England now you to Atlanta sixteen and we got the band queen of salt and things from a Seattle and they have suffered especially here goblet sometimes when you had gone to the super gold has all been on championship days at all it's a a bit left and the alkaline suitable 1998. You know also that it's almost like we hit outburst out in nineteen. Second child and two of them play you get excited that if you're. The everywhere you've got. Way up here okay. They act. Yeah we don't get excited about they're definitely more rounds you achieve so it had decided time here you know I'm happy for that falcons and the pain and ownership. Our final question does so what your motivational speaker tell me what's so what's going on in your life for it now. Odd that you actually I am a speaker. Ought television personality to a few days there in Atlanta and I'm trying to get back up into the Baltic area completely at that I won about speaking pointed out speak from is public to corporate America is. Institutions. In. Translated and allowed them to the house what America. Had comfortable there could be a plaque in corporate America and it Cadillac pick his way. How you Pat The Bat to let employees. How to motivate you police and would complete look for and how ownership. Plays a big part in. A six game. So they a lot of being this what America can teach corporate America and build something don't want this forest but speaking and not on trying to get other companies can degree utility anybody's political. The secret to ultimate success. The patriots way they can look the opposite I'm the important. 38 dot com. Email info at Cairo who thirty dot com. The website at www. I put these big daddy daddy got it. That diamond people do but that's okay good coaches Tyrone Poole got yes I report 38 doctor Robert yeah our right thanks so much Tyrone really appreciate your love your recital that's let's let's do this against or your your great guests really appreciated. Yeah thank you thank you. Aren't various Tyrone Poole joining us our right here. On sports reader don't Riyadh former patriot. A quarterback plays for on two teams would best known for playing with that just outstanding. Our defensive backfield. Back about three that's in incredible back to what Ty law and Eugene Wilson Rodney Harrison and just the defense I mean think about look. For able piper Bruschi mcginnis Seymour. Teddy Washington. Hamilton and that's arguably the best defense printed to progress had no question about it right. A quick break the back the thoughts Andrew Jason John as you guys lined up still trying to figure out what a system that is. That's not Tut and still lost on target there what this this system is is lazy journalistic approach. That people throughout the year on national networks about what the system is it all applied to anybody else all through page or some try to figure it out I need your help. Six what's at 7797037. Beat typical ten a Christian market will take over right here Sports Radio WEEI. You. He brought into it and he'd been out of that agreement Rossiter spoke well mind you remember US beat teams. The army can't really BR be annoyed if a short period throughout the deal what he's done them no it would breach. Could PU that pellets Shaq can see he's got like you're like I agree with you they threw a lot of consistent dose and a lot of Belichick not publicly but. During his own when you look at hoagie in mid. Hogan does have degrees weasel like he is a cheese steak guy you have time he's Benedict yeah I. ET he show you bet he did make some plays in knowing. Forty quicker okay effort tape player. Half. Pack. That's a key shot just again via with the flag too for the falcons. Ignited 75 or relatives. Opel had radio. I mean are you serious suit don't challenge key shots up on there and if he said that. Write to me I'd say define what the system is because I really would like to know. There have been here born on three hours now I still can't figure out what these national that would mean by. System. But I would like to know. Six point 7779700%. But god forbid. He radio host on Atlanta or some of these tea bags on ESPN and NFL network who spew that nonsense that brought that phrase out there all the time. Nobody ever challenges anybody. Andrews and they brought next. WEEI hello we drew. Yeah. June. I don't want not what they're gonna serve let me portable I added that you and you know. And we got it on the radio does well he don't call thank you very much at least when it. I would ever you best of luck but like crap out of my dorm room at night filled out because the content Spanish or gotten back. Where it was you know any bit of black little about it because I don't like Malaysia. Opening it all right but as. It gets cold and outlaw well I hope you you know give back on track in the REIT I get past and it's been a community doctor in a move on to. Or less the less the best of luck so you can Roger Goodell. Yes it L I don't hit a bird and lately because I'm out. Of those pictures and you'd think what they're accused of absolutely dead I think they work to get around those footballs and I think he's at the where he was an atlas. You've got those guys get the book also I want them if you don't know what else again you know Tunisia they were doing it but they edit. But those guys found a way to do it and Intel. Like the ideal gas supply had 99.9 percent to do with a lot of how do you explain. It away why should you might fall sometime and show you some text messages that happened I mean. I got wanted on the throw again but I I get to be it's it's always a little bit so it can be out there but it. They're text messages there are sad that there. You know I'm sure god summons sent some in the past that if somebody saw I didn't know grab at a particular conversation. Or taken out of context of me you know it's. It's really really tough for me convict somebody off protectionist I don't know what the owner was Ment Ment for them but I. Well I think you're using corporate spirit of the owners they don't let everything it is you know and they let you know what does that and it's gonna go all we want we want lighten. The patriot because we think they're doing all this crazy stuff and you're gonna does it he or we give it forty million dollar lottery you know it is a lot of blame Rupert deplete it I don't get like Britney and injured at a big part of what you. It are what he sent last week I called our eat at. Robert there's football age. That that that probably aren't you get it at every other and a OK maybe even better and that up like a great rights and Beckett. So angry because so it. I don't cook Gallagher Donald Trump tables requiring you tell you would rating and that and he'd lied to me not what you're gonna lie right. Why don't worst part about it they're recidivism up against severe but the worst part about is that no one challenges him he says that stuff about Thursday night games he's lying out of is that the nose is growing like Pinocchio. I mean it's just it's just did it at but not not challenged at all or not challenged judge and Randolph updates at W Riyadh job. And here our deputy budge on how you we appear on our current program do does. Well Olson. You have creditor earlier and I agree with you they're using were in because bay dole and give the patriots. Sit ecosystem or losing system here's a. Yeah and I think it is I think it's a culture that a patriot tat and air arm. Mr. cool. And Carter and Carter sat at a rate or other. And then Brady in that it. After the hectic at all that you know what happened out there from it in order to a senior at. You know our ultimate motivation these guys right here and I read wired. Are some of these guys are in. Like cattle go. Can be very APR IRL. Wary when you have okay come and Julian adamant quarterback commands he liked. It because of big inning guy or not. They're self all up there. The speaker ray is that their outlook or bury our elders they wait for other. It sort of you know. If the Communists are throw absent and will it because you know when you go yeah. Now throw all around here you know I think that what makes it seem so great is that they're all out there all played for the team in place for each other. Dad Jon and make a lot of your points are just a what I am I agree yard percent I don't know why the rest of the NFL can't figure it out because I that you contribute if the you'd just. If you if you blocked out all the faces and you blocked out the logo. And you just watched on film how they have played over the last sixteen years and UB futures were up focus on this year. I I I doubt that this the term system the system world would come up just replies. Lazy this when it comes to them to news media talking about the patriots. Took what 77797. ID 373 hours double border goes Sam rob bill. See you guys all like up that'll get your calls to finally. A liar to open wanna chime in six point 777 night seven knighted threesome will continue the discussion about the patriots and the falcons at just what. As the system in the NFL I'm still not entirely convinced I I know what it is that I have an idea. But I'm trying to figure out that this time the system.

Hacksaw Ridge Isn't Just An Explicitly Christian Film, It's Also A Deserved Oscar Nominee Women's March: Hundreds Of Thousands Of Feminist Protesters Gather In Washington Against Trump ... 3 Reasons Why Today Is Called the 'Present' JB Cachila 28 January 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it Next Post >> x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Pexels Yesterday is called the past because it has already passed, and tomorrow is called the future because it is still coming. But today isn't called the "present" for nothing. I know that sounds cliché, but did you know that in God's hands the present is more than just the day or date that you are in while reading this article? It's really more than just that. Present Defined Google defines "present" as a noun pertaining to "a thing given to someone as a gift" or an adjective stating "the period of time now occurring." There's also a verb form pronounced as "pre-zent," which means "give something to someone formally or ceremonially." From these definitions we are going to see why the present means so much more than we care to realise when it's in God's hands. 1. It's a Gift Advertisement Today is a gift from God. It's both a fact and a truth that no one can ever purchase for himself an additional day to live. While a man is able to pay for another night's stay in a hotel, or spend a fortune for medical treatments that could prolong his life a bit, only the Lord is able to add a day to our lives on a daily basis. This simply means that if you're alive today, God has decided to give it to you. After all, He wants to bless His children with long life (see Psalm 91:14-16). "This is the day that the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it." (Psalm 118:24 MEV) 2. It's Occurring Now, Not Earlier Or Later Today simply means "today," not yesterday. What God is doing in your life right now is different from what He has done in days, weeks, months, and years past. God doesn't want you looking back and condemning yourself for what you have done from the time you were born until yesterday. He simply wants you to move on, sin no more, and live for Him. "Stop dwelling on past events and brooding over times gone by; I am doing something new; it's springing up — can't you see it?" (see Isaiah 43:18-19 CJB) 3. In It, God Has Something in Store for You Now that we've established that today is a gift and is another chance at living for God, we need to realise that today is also another opportunity for us to be blessed by God. The Bible tells us that His mercies are available for us always. No wonder – it's renewed every morning like a fresh cup of coffee: strong, flavourful, and able to wake you up from your slumber. Enjoy God's mercies today! "Through the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness." (Lamentations 3:22-23 NKJV) Today Is the Day to Know Him Whatever the date may be, each day is an opportunity for us to know God, be loved by Him, and love Him back. Enjoy loving Him today!   Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it Trade Ashes for Beauty By Doing This 3 Things You Need to See God's Plans Better Tweet Email More News in Life Why God's Joy Is Different From The World's Happiness As Christians, we are to look to God's joy and not the happiness of this world.

To get The Daily Crunch in your inbox every day of the week, sign up here. Alphabet’s ‘other bets’ start looking like better bets, Microsoft ascends to the clouds and Trump enlists more titans of tech. All that and more in The Daily Crunch for January 27, 2017. And if you’re a billionaire prepper, Middle Earth apparently looks like a pretty good escape route. 1. Alphabet’s letters beyond G are starting to make money Alphabet formed to make sure that it could treat Google and its other businesses with the individual care and accountability that each merits, and now its Other Bets are starting to pay off. During its most recent quarter, it revealed big growth for revenue from that category of its business, and a significant decrease in spending. We’ve seen a lot of action in the Other Bets category to turn things around this year, including shifts from pure research to early commercialization at Waymo and Verity, for instance. Expect this to continue and accelerate through 2017. 2. Microsoft Office and cloud offerings push earnings up Microsoft saw a bit better performance than analysts were expecting in its quarterly earnings, helped along by growth in its Office and cloud segments, which is promising because the company is really restructuring to focus on those offerings as its primary concerns. AI and cloud were the talk of the town on the earnings call, too. Everyone’s betting on distributed, intangible brains. 3. Donald Trump’s manufacturing council includes tech leaders Trump’s preference for a regulation-light industry environment has industry leaders trying to get close to help sway things their way. This time around, a new manufacturing council Trump set up has announced its full membership. The council includes Dell CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and more. If things go south for this administration, which seems like a fairly reasonable possibility, it’s going to be awkward seeing all these industry leaders walk it back. 4. Apple’s looking to boost its AI efforts Apple is in danger of either being or appearing a laggard in the AI world, and that could have big impact on its ability to recruit top talent. Two moves today should help on that front. In iOS 10.3 it’s offering an opt-in feature that would allow Apple to analyze user iCloud data anonymously and use it to drive its intelligent software work. Separately, it also officially joined the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society, with Siri lead Tom Gruber acting as Apple’s representative. This is likely intended to signal to AI talent that the iPhone-maker is actively participating in the field. 5. Snapchat’s big UI overhaul Snapchat hasn’t done much in the way of changing its basic UI, but a new universal search feature is a big difference. The feature arrived for iOS users, and there’s a lot to go through if you’re used to the way things were. Anthony takes a look at the changes in a diet demo. 6. Thiel of New Zealand Peter Thiel is a New Zealand citizen, it turns out. Heck of a backup plan for a guy helping Trump turn the U.S. upside down. 7. Tesla sues Chris Urmson and its former head of Autopilot A lawsuit exposed stealth startup Aurora to the light, since the company co-founded by Chris Urmson and Tesla ex-Director of Autopilot Sterling Anderson was named along with the men as defendants in a civil lawsuit from Tesla. Tesla says its former employee stole company secrets and poached employees – though it was pretty unsuccessful at the last bit, as only two employees ended up going over to the new co., which works on autonomous driving software systems. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:45 | Crunch Report Weekly Roundup: AppDynamics sells to Cisco ahead of IPO, CZI buys Meta 12 hours ago | Anna Escher Apple aims to up its AI smarts with iCloud user data in iOS 10.3 17 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields 18 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off yesterday | Matthew Lynley Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | Galaxy S8 Coming in March 5 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Snap will reportedly file publicly for its massive IPO late next week 9 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Twitter releases national security letters 10 hours ago | Kate Conger Zuckerberg defends immigrants threatened by Trump 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by Up Next Disrupt NY 2017 registration is open, get your extra early bird tickets now Posted 16 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Senior Developer - 41399BR at Harvard University - Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Cambridge, MA, United States) Engineer: Client Support Center at Target (Brooklyn Park, MN, United States) Product Manager at Calldorado (Kongens Lyngby (Copenhagen), Denmark) IT Infrastructure Manager (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland; Berlin, Deutschland) Digital Strategies Manager at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolinas Realty (Charlotte, NC, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Facebook may be preparing to explore partnerships with the music business, if a recent hire is any indication. Tamara Hrivnak, one of the key music executives at YouTube, just announced she is joining Facebook “to lead global music strategy and business development."  Appropriately, Hrivnak made the announcement in a Facebook post. Neither Hrivnak nor Facebook would comment. But the fact that the social network hired a respected music lawyer with a history of working on licensing deals suggests that it’s interested in licensing music. Hrivnak, a lawyer, worked as director of music partnerships for Google Play and YouTube, where she was seen by major label executives as a dealmaker who understood their business at a company where few people do. She reported to YouTube chief business officer Robert Kyncl. Before going to Google in 2011, Hrivnak was vp of digital strategy & business affairs for Warner/Chappell Music Publishing. Over the past year, music videos have become more popular on Facebook, but most of them are not licensed – which has become a matter of concern to rightsholders. “I think our next big fight is with Facebook,” National Music Publishers’ Association CEO David Israelite said in a recent interview. (In Decemeber, news broke that Facebook was developing a content ID system to stem music infringement.) He added that he hoped the situation would change: “Being business partners isn’t only smarter, it’s the right thing to do — and I think they want to do the right thing.” The fact that Hrivnak described her job as “global music strategy and business development” suggests that it could do so soon.   FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

ROS LBoard 1 Run a business on the side, fresh grads told Sheith Khidhir Bin Abu Bakar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US FBI request for Twitter account data may have overstepped legal guidelines Reuters | January 28, 2017 In a blog post announcing the two national security letter (NSL) disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. WASHINGTON: The FBI appeared to go beyond the scope of existing legal guidance in seeking certain kinds of internet records from Twitter as recently as last year, legal experts said, citing two warrantless surveillance orders the social media company published on Friday. Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet’s Google and Yahoo. Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo’s guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. “While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,” Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. “This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended,” said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of last year the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

While constantly monitoring our emails often feels like an obligation, if not an obsession, technology has freed us in a lot of ways as well. For example, in 2015, nearly a fourth of employed people did some or all of their work from home online, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Need to know something quickly? Google it. Need groceries delivered? There are apps for that. Want to video-chat with someone in Finland? You can, with the touch of a button. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 84 percent of U.S. households owned a computer in 2013; almost three-quarters reported internet use. Soon, more of us will be associating another convenience with online technology: volunteering. Roughly a fourth of U.S. adults — 62.6 million people — volunteered between September 2014 and September 2015, the most recent data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Think about how much those numbers could grow if we could boost our volunteering opportunities to include online work, in addition to working at a homeless shelter or delivering meals to the elderly. That’s increasingly becoming reality. For example, starting in 2014, volunteers — working digitally from around the world — have helped the British Red Cross map some of the world’s most remote and vulnerable settlements. Thanks to better maps, humanitarian organizations can respond more effectively during epidemics, conflicts, natural disasters and other crises. Closer to home, you could help out by taking phone calls from home for organizations like the Montrose Center in Houston, which offers opportunities for some volunteers to handle crisis calls through the center’s LGBT switchboard 24-hour helpline. Looking for something a little less hands-on? You can personally help advance science by simply donating some data. For example, one app, “100 for Parkinson’s,” collects anonymous health data each day from people in order to conduct “a global study for everyone, aiming to find out how tracking your health can help improve the lives of those with Parkinson’s — and those [without].” Nesta, an innovation charity in the U.K., has a new program called Click Connect Learn, which aims to provide volunteers from around the world to tutor disadvantaged students online. “My prediction is that 2017 might just be the year of micro-volunteering and data donation, with cheap technologies allowing everyone to volunteer from home for short and sweet periods of time, no matter how much time they have to give,” wrote Nesta director Vicki Sellick. That’s good news for people looking for creative ways to live up to those big-hearted New Year’s resolutions. Volunteering online can’t supplant the in-person needs your local community has, but it can help you spread your efforts wider. — The Dallas Morning News Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

Hall/AP) Technology Cloud computing demand pushes Microsoft’s quarterly profit up 3.6 per cent Add to ... Reuters Published Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 4:25PM EST Last updated Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 4:31PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Microsoft Corp reported a 3.6 per cent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, powered by a surge in demand for the company’s flagship cloud platform Azure. The company’s shares were marginally higher at $64.34 in after-hours trading. Since taking charge in 2014, Chief Executive Satya Nadella has steered the company toward cloud services and mobile applications away from its slowing traditional software business. The company’s “Intelligent Cloud” business, which includes Azure, rose 8 per cent to $6.9 billion in the second quarter. That beat analysts’ average estimate of $6.73 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Revenue from Azure, which businesses can use to host their websites, apps or data, jumped 93 percent in the quarter. Sales had more than doubled in the preceding quarter. The Azure platform competes with offerings from companies including Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc’s Google, IBM Corp and Oracle Corp. Microsoft does not give an absolute revenue figure for Azure. Amazon’s AWS, Azure’s biggest competitor, grew revenues 55 percent to $3.23 billion in its most recent quarter. Sales in Microsoft’s personal computing business, which includes its Windows software, fell 5 percent to $11.8 billion. Worldwide PC shipments, which have been in decline since 2012, fell 5.7 in 2016 from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. However, the market is showing signs of stabilization. Nadella also orchestrated Microsoft’s biggest acquisition, the $26.2 billion deal for LinkedIn. The transaction closed last month. LinkedIn contributed $228 million of revenue in the second quarter, Microsoft said. LinkedIn also reported a net loss of $100 million, or 1 cent per share, in the quarter. Excluding items, Microsoft earned 83 cents per share. The company’s net income rose to $5.20 billion, or 66 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from $5.02 billion, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted revenue rose to $26.07 billion from $25.51 billion. Microsoft’s shares had risen 23.2 percent in the past twelve months, compared with the 20.7 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 index.

Click here to support us on Patreon. ★ News TouchArcade Needs Your Help - Tell Your Friends and Support Our Patreon Author Eli Hodapp Posted On2017-01-27 21:45:20 Watch App   Featured, News It's a wrap for us this week here at TouchArcade, and provided nothing crazy happens in the world of iOS gaming, we'll see you again on Monday morning for Shaun's Update Mondays and Tasos's Touchstone Tavern Hearthstone [Free] roundup before diving in head-first to whatever awesome mobile games get released and whatever rad looking mobile games are coming soon. We've been doing this for years now, and to keep doing what we're doing, we need your help. Whether you're here for our game reviews, to read about upcoming games, find games on sale, listen to our podcast, or participate in your community, we're glad to have you. If the feeling is mutual, which I hope it is, there's a few things you can do to help keep TouchArcade alive in this weird changing world of mobile gaming, which for numerous reasons has jeopardized the future of third party editorial sites like ours. First off, and the easiest, tell your friends about TouchArcade. Practically everyone has a smartphone now, and as Pokemon Go [Free] has shown, even total non-gamers are playing mobile games. If you see your friends have a bunch of junky games on their phone, they'd probably appreciate learning about a site and community like ours where they can find good stuff to play. Tell them about our podcast, encourage them to register for our forums, whatever you're comfortable with. Organic growth via trusted word of mouth is the best way to get other great people onto our little island of appreciating great mobile games, which really just makes things better for everyone. Another easy thing you can do is if you read something on TouchArcade that you like, share it out to your online friends via Twitter or Facebook or posting the article on Reddit. Most of our traffic comes from Google, which means our top trafficked stories are consistently about (often dumb, or otherwise generally uninteresting) popular stuff. Shaun's RPG Reload series, which I think is some of the best content we put out, are always among our worst performing articles. I'd love if that eventually changed, but in order to get there, we need to depend on our core community of readers who I know appreciate our long-form content to help spread the word. Even a few people sharing those articles makes a significant difference. A lot of people seem to discover TouchArcade via our podcast, and both subscribing and leaving us an iTunes review helps us appear higher in the iTunes charts and search results. Also, going back to my first point, in telling your friends, if you know someone who listens to a lot of gaming podcasts, it'd be great if you could recommend they check out ours. All of those things can be done at no cost to you, and with practically no effort. If you want to help TouchArcade even further, these days we're primarily supported by Patreon. We're still a long way from our original goal which would allow us to do all sorts of stuff like creating even more content, cover even more events, and potentially even explore the feasibility of updating the existing app or creating an entirely new one. TouchArcade gets millions of visitors a month, and (as of this writing) barely over 500 of those people are Patreon backers. We'd love to see that number increase, as every dollar contributed directly goes back to making this site more awesome. Think of it as a magazine subscription, but you get way more than just one outdated issue a month. Even if you're not willing to do any of this, thanks for visiting TouchArcade. We'll see ya' next week. TouchArcade - The Best New Games by TouchArcade.com, LLC Free Watch Button Watch App TouchArcade Game of the Week: 'Splitter Critters' What Even Is a Spinki? - The TouchArcade Show #292 callmesteam Easily my favorite app is TouchArcade. Great podcast too. Happy to share and donate. Thanks guys. runesnatcher If you are looking for a Christmas gift for the gamer in your life, why not support this site in their name? SatanicWampa For me, Touch Arcade is like the IGN of mobile. I seriously wouldn't have discovered, much less even bought like 90% of my phone games if not for this site. Totally an invaluable resource for anyone remotely interested in playing worthwhile games on their phones or tablets. Anotherkellydown +1 lezrock +1 Dragan If so many people, including myself, are enjoying T.A. and so little of them seem to care about supporting the service then maybe it's time to make it a payed app. It could also help to give a iap (subscription) option since a lot of people are still hesitant to make financial transactions over the internet, I'm one of them. But if I could help through a iap I would be glad to do so. I would only expect more reviews. Furthermore I think it's ridiculous that Apple don't support a site which stimulates the sales of games so much. They reap the benefits without any investment. If T.A. and Pocket gamer wouldn't exist then a lot of releases would stay unnoticed. Amenbrother Totally agree make a paid app or put a IAP in this one and I would be happy to help. Tallgeese Sorry, as nice as an idea as that would be as far as I know, the TA app cannot be updated to include that feature. . TA's app-store-like (non-rogue-like) feature eventually became a no-no on the app store but fortunately Apple has not removed it entirely. In addition, Apple gets 30% of whatever purchases are made in the app store, so 30% or your hypothetical in-app donations would be given to the... 11th largest corporation by revenue, something it no-no needs. . I know what you're thinking, "but, Tallgeese, isn't a 'no-no' a double negative, therefore making it a positive?" And that I question I must only answer with a riddle, "If you could see the zenith of the highest mountain from the very bottom of the Earth, would there still be a reason to climb to the precipice, keeping in mind that the high ground is indeed the superior sniping and lightsaber defensive position?" Therein you must clearly see the folly of your quest, Gogmagog. For mankind shall never allow for a giant such as ye to tower over him in any pursuit other than your own crystalline awareness of intellectual and ontological purity. . And, really, who names their child "Gogmagog?" Parents these days... ROGER-NL Yeah, I wanna pay via the TA app, make this happen please. loox Ok. I just subscribed to the podcast and left a review. How could I not when you two just took the cutest picture ever!!??!! TechUser2011 I don't understand why TA needs direct sponsorship. You're a sister site of MacRumors, right? They don't ask for direct donations. And I see as many ads on TA as I do on MacRumors. http://www.wavelightgames.com/ WaveLightGames Increased my pledge amount. You guys are the only some indie devs like myself even get noticed in the app store. DeNappa "potentially even explore the feasibility of updating the existing app or creating an entirely new one." As if Apple would allow that ;( Luigi_Mario I'd recommend biting the bullet on sponsored content and/or something like Amazon product recommendations. As long as it's properly labeled, I don't think there's much of a downside. Tallgeese Kickstarter something nuts! ... Either the thing you're kicking is nuts or the digital reward is digital peanuts... Either way please put me down for "holding hands for the poor." profhuggybear Ok I just tried three times to sign up for the patron and give you guys some money with no luck. Kept getting an error saying I needed to try a different browser. I'm on my phone and can't give you guys some money?! Please look into it. I really enjoy your site and want to support the work you do. I'll check back tomorrow. mark@hollyandsmith.com Same here I've tried a number of times to join from my phone but always get an error message after I confirm thumbs07 I told my non-IOS loving friend. He raised an eyebrow. Spudboy If you are ever able to update the app. Include a 'tip jar'. I tip the developer of Downcast often. That's how I hear the podcast. Baron Cappuccino Like a few others here, I just tried to sign up for Patreon, but I have to wait till tomorrow to continue on my laptop. Patreon's flaws aren't TA's fault, but if any organization needs its fundraising to be mobile- iOS even- compatible, it's TA. I wonder if that's holding back recruits? Baron Cappuccino I figured it out. After you get rejected, go to safari and the patreon page should be on top. Go into the menu and find where you can set up payment sources. In my case, I chose PayPal. Get that done and then go back to TA here, because patreon won't have you supporting anything. Choose the link here and pick your donation again. This time it will work. lezrock Awesome work and dedicated mobile gaming journalism guys. Keep it up. It's much needed! lezrock Flatr is a thing here in germany. Shkrbby This app and its website are not bad in its current capacity, however I believe that it could be made even better with much more diverse content, at least for us oldies. For example, why not have a regular, say monthly, feature where you go behind the scenes of gaming to bring us indepth interviews with the devs and/or indie labels? Who they are, where they live, what's their studio is like, what apps do they use, where do they source they ideas/inspirations from? Who knows it might inspire some Flappy Golf playing schoolie into developing the next Imbroglio. runesnatcher Come on people - put your money to work for what you love. Chip in! rezn I increased from a $5 a month contributor the last couple years to a $10 lover of all things TA. Thanks for kicking ass again and again. wasabipeas I love you touch arcade ! I feel however ,having to sign up for patron and having to subscribe would put a lot of people off ! have you thought of trying a fund raiser or kickstarter style ,one of payment system ? similar to what wiki have done . either way , best app ever !

Seelye, New York Times News Service January 27, 2017 Zainab Abdo, 21, a Syrian refugee, left, and Tara Media, an Iraqi refugee, at a job training session on Thursday with Vito LaMura, an International Institute of New England volunteer in Lowell, Massachusetts. —Shiho Fukada / The New York Times LOWELL, Mass. — When Hawo Ahmed, her two sisters and their mother arrived here late Wednesday night, the Somali family could hardly believe their good fortune. “It’s like a dream come true,” Ahmed, 24, said. Their arrival was all the more remarkable because they may be among the last refugees allowed into the United States before President Donald Trump closes the borders. He signed an executive order suspending the nation’s resettlement program temporarily, with an eye toward shrinking it when it resumes. Ahmed and her family had never heard of Lowell, an old mill city about 30 miles northwest of Boston with red brick factories lining its canals, until they searched for it on Google from Kenya two weeks ago. Advertisement But if Lowell is strange to them, having them here is not strange for Lowell. Immigrants, including many refugees, are part of the fabric of life in this city of 108,000, which boasts a kaleidoscope of cultures. Downtown is bursting with restaurants serving Portuguese, Mexican, Greek, Cambodian, Thai and Japanese fare. Lowell features a statue of Buddha, a plaque honoring Nelson Mandela and a big sign in the high school that welcomes visitors in multiple languages. Colorful flags of various nationalities hang in the windows of homes here, and ethnic festivals are common. Arabic is regularly heard in shops. For a city with such a heavy refugee presence, Trump’s order is not an abstract political issue, but one that could alter families’ lives and even the community itself — especially if, as people here fear, the temporary policy is made permanent. Farouq Ali, an Iraqi refugee who arrived in Lowell in 2009 and works with new refugees, said he and other Iraqis in the area had been exchanging near-constant Facebook messages about Trump’s impending policy. Over the weekend, he said, dozens of Iraqi and Syrian women gathered at a restaurant to share their fears. “Most Iraqis have some of their families back in Iraq, so they are struggling to bring them to Lowell, to America,” Ali said. Trump’s policy, he said, could shatter their hopes. Old mills converted into an apartment complex in Lowell. —Shiho Fukada / The New York Times Advertisement Lowell and its many nonprofit organizations devoted to refugees and immigrant groups are haltingly coming to terms with the idea that, at least for now, the flow of refugees here could stop or slow, a startling turnaround for a city built by immigrant labor. People from French Canada, Ireland, Portugal and Poland powered Lowell’s once-mighty textile mills starting in the 1800s, and immigrants and refugees have found homes here ever since. It is a place where the history of immigration in the United States is writ large. Many of the mills closed before World War II, and the city’s population declined, but it picked up again in the late 1970s as a wave of Cambodians fleeing the Khmer Rouge came to the city. Today, Cambodians make up some 13 percent of the population, and Lowell has the second-largest Cambodian community in the country, after Long Beach, California. A Cambodian represents part of Lowell in the state Legislature. “Lowell has been replenished and re-energized by refugees and immigrants for generations,” said Jeffrey Thielman, president and chief executive of the International Institute of New England, which works with the federal government to resettle refugees in Lowell, Boston and Manchester, New Hampshire. “We won’t feel it right away,” Thielman said of a halt in refugees, “but businesses will not have enough workers, and not having enough workers will inhibit Lowell’s ability to grow.” The region’s economy and its immigrants are closely intertwined. Southwick, a factory in nearby Haverhill that makes suits for Brooks Brothers, offers four English classes per week for about 70 refugees and other immigrants who work there. Thithi Aye, a Burmese refugee who arrived here in 2010, carpooled from Lowell to her job at Southwick every day with other refugees, including one from Iraq. Eventually, she was able to buy her own car, and then a condo. Advertisement Employers see hiring refugees as a win for everyone, as supply meets demand. “They use us as a steppingstone for the betterment of their families,” said John Martynec, Southwick’s senior vice president for manufacturing. Because there are so many nonprofit organizations, volunteers and government services here to support refugees, a decline in the number of refugees could lead to a withering of those support services. “If everything’s closed off for a period of time, the problem would then be figuring out how to rebuild the infrastructure to welcome people in,” said Robert Forrant, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, whose classes include third-generation Cambodians. Samantha Cail, the owner of HyperText Bookstore and Café in Lowell, said she found the idea of barring refugees “horrifying.” —Shiho Fukada / The New York Times The possibility of closing the borders has unsettled some residents who are not part of the refugee community. Samantha Cail, 49, the owner of HyperText Bookstore and Café, said she found it “horrifying.” “This administration’s ability to demonize the ‘other’ is very frightening to me,” said Cail, who voted for Hillary Clinton. The vast variety of cultures and ethnicities was one reason she was attracted to Lowell, where she has lived for 11 years. “There’s always Cambodian operas or amazing, yearlong festivals that really add color and depth to the community,” she said. Cail said she was not worried that terrorists would slip through, in part because the vetting process, which takes at least two years, seemed so rigorous. But Cheryl Carville, 54, a longtime Lowell resident who works in retail and voted for Trump, was more concerned. She said that her philosophy was “live and let live,” but that she could not think of a reason the borders should not be closed for 120 days. “You got to know what’s going on,” she said, adding that she wondered how many refugees the city could really absorb. “You got to know who’s coming in here.” “At some point,” she asked, “how much can you take in, and how much before it starts hurting everybody else?” Trump says he wants a smaller refugee program with “extreme vetting” as a safeguard against terrorism. Lowell is a mostly Democratic city — Clinton won it with 65 percent of the vote — but when Trump held a rally here a year ago, he easily packed the arena. David Donovan, 25, said immigrants had enriched Lowell but added, “Given that we’re in a state of war, it’s O.K. to freeze the border.” —Shiho Fukada / The New York Times David Donovan, 25, an electrician and longtime Lowell resident, agreed that it was “reasonable” to suspend the resettlement program, even though he had voted for Clinton. Cambodians in particular, he said, had done much to enrich Lowell. But, he added, “given that we’re in a state of war, it’s OK to freeze the border.” In the meantime, the city is continuing to absorb refugees like the newly arrived Ahmed family. On Thursday, the International Institute of New England helped organize a job fair here at which 18 other refugees met employers who were looking for workers in the health care field. Lisa Gurgone, executive director of the Home Care Aide Council, told the refugees that the aging of New England virtually guaranteed them jobs in health care. “We need all of you,” she said. Among the refugees who attended the job fair was Zainab Abdo, 21, who came in May from Syria, where her home in Aleppo had been bombed. She said she was relieved to be here, had been treated well and was taking nursing classes at Middlesex Community College. “There is security here,” she said. “We feel safe.” And yet, with Trump’s executive order in the works, she remains nervous about the future, especially for relatives still in Syria and Turkey, who she had hoped would be able to join her family here. Luis Pedroso, an immigrant from the Azores who helped found an electronics factory, said that he had employees who were refugees and that he viewed Trump’s order as an overreaction. “Lowell has been known as a location for so many different, diverse parts of the world,” he said. “It’s a shame that Mr. Trump sees that he needs to be doing this.” TOPICS: Local News Donald Trump Politics Want to see what readers are saying about our stories?

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon So massive was the pile of manure lining the edge of David and Joan Gallant’s property in rural New Brunswick, it could be seen using satellite imagery. And the stench? Unbearable, they said. Especially after it rained or when the wind blew from the east. But despite the Gallants’ repeated complaints to neighbours Lee and Shirley Murray, the pile of poop just sat there for almost a year, part of an ugly — and escalating — dispute. The Murrays had without question set out to make the Gallants’ lives “miserable,” Court of Queen’s Bench Justice George Rideout said in a recent decision. “The manure was piled high and a photo taken by Google (Earth) from a satellite shows it.” And the Murrays’ offensive actions didn’t stop there, the judge said. The Murrays used a snowblower to send snow and rocks onto the Gallants’ property and likely were behind the escape of numerous cows onto their property, causing extensive hoof damage to the lawn. “I have little doubt these activities were initiated by the Murrays and designed to inflict fear, nuisance and harassment against the Gallants,” the judge said. The manure was fresh, unseasoned, wet, raw manure. The smell was disgusting. Reached by phone, Lee Murray said Friday he and his wife planned to appeal, insisting that they were the ones who had been harassed and that their one-time friends had “made a big fuss over nothing” and were just looking for money. “There’s more to this,” he said. “This thing isn’t over yet.” The Gallants purchased their property from the Murrays in Indian Mountain, just outside Moncton, in 2001. The Murray property borders the Gallant property on three sides. It is not clear from the court records when or what caused the relationship between the two couples to sour. But in court affidavits, the Gallants say things got really bad when, over the course of several days in November 2013, the Murrays deposited hundreds of loads of cow manure along a strip of land next to their property. On one occasion, the Gallants said they were awoken at 4 a.m. by the sound of a loader dumping manure. “I called Lee Murray on his cellphone to complain, but he hung up on me,” David Gallant, who is retired, said in his affidavit. “The manure was fresh, unseasoned, wet, raw manure. The smell was disgusting,” he said. It was just the beginning of a long string of complaints documented by the Gallants. In March 2014, they alleged, the Murrays used their snowblower to blow snow and rocks onto their property. In May 2014, they alleged that about 50 cattle from the Murray property escaped through a gate, causing extensive damage to their lawn from “hoofprint holes” and damage to three trees. “I saw cow dung all over our property,” David Gallant said in his affidavit. In September 2014, they say that Lee Murray put a large bale of hay near their back fence, “with the presumably intentional effect that it drew his cattle to eat, urinate and defecate as close to our house as possible.” It was around this time that the Gallants filed a complaint with the New Brunswick Farm Practices Review Board regarding the pile of manure. The following month, the Murrays finally removed the manure pile, but in the process of doing so, the Gallants alleged, they started a brush fire that caused smoke to enter their garage. Related Dispute over parking spot turns condo into site of all-out war of liens, lawsuits and arrests Bitter feud between N.L. neighbours has disputed death threat, claims of cat gas chambers, and hard-of-hearing deputy sheriff Feud between residents at this B.C. seniors condo is ‘so bizarre’ even a judge had a hard time believing it was real In December 2014, the Farm Practices Review Board held a hearing and concluded that the cattle escape and placement of manure near the Gallants’ property constituted “unacceptable farming practices” and recommended a number of changes. The very next day the Gallants said they found a long scratch along the side of their car. “It is very unusual to observe this kind of vandalism where we live, on a rural road where the properties are very large and far apart from each other,” David Gallant said. In early 2015, the Gallants sued the Murrays in an effort to stop what they said was an “increasing pattern of aggression.” The judge opens his Jan. 19 decision with this observation: “When neighbours fight, nothing good results. The case now before the court proves this adage.” Rideout said he had “no hesitation” in finding that the Murrays’ conduct had been “wilful and reprehensible” and awarded the Gallants $15,000 in damages. (The judge noted that the Murrays’ insurance company had previously covered damage related to the cattle escape.) He also issued an injunction forbidding the Murrays from entering the Gallants’ property; spreading manure within 300 metres of their property; blowing snow, rocks or manure onto their property; and communicating with the Gallants, except in writing. The Gallants could not be reached Friday. Murray, who reportedly pleaded guilty last year in a separate case to failing to obtain the proper permits to have more than 19 head of cattle, insisted the manure he had dumped next to the Gallants’ property was old and did not give off an odour. And the debris that was blown onto their property was merely “small shovelfuls.” Murray insisted he gets along with all of his other neighbours and that over the Christmas holidays, he helped spread gravel on their driveways. If neighbours get into a disagreement, they should resolve things by talking, Murray said. Never, he said, was he looking to aggravate the Gallants. “I’m not that type of guy.” • Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Skip to content GPS Tracking Info Just another NEWS site Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto FBI request for Twitter account data may have overstepped legal guidelines By admin in Uncategorized January 28, 2017 WASHINGTON: The FBI appeared to go beyond the scope of existing legal guidance in seeking certain kinds of internet records from Twitter as recently as last year, legal experts said, citing two warrantless surveillance orders the social media company published on Friday.Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet’s Google and Yahoo.Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters , specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information.In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records.The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo’s guidance.In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested.”While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,” Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote.The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs.Aaron Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance.”This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended,” said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs.National security letters are… Tags: FBI, Twitter Post navigation Snapchat to reveal financials within a week: sources Prestigious St. Catherine Academy Marks 134th Anniversary Search for: Recent Posts Klopp: Recent knocks are part of our process Sunderland fight Saints for Gabbiadini?

For our first giveaway, we’re giving away the Huawei Mate 9. It’s Huawei’s first flagship Android phone to officially come to the United States, and it could be yours — all you have to do is be an active reader! We reviewed the international version of the phone when it launched last fall, and called it the first non-Nexus Huawei phone that’s great across the board. Huawei had a hit with the made-with-Google Nexus 6P a couple years ago, but now the company’s diving head-first into the US market with a flagship phone that we believe can rival Google’s own Pixel — which is one of the best phones ever. (Stay tuned for our second look at the Huawei Mate 9 for the US, which we’ll be publishing after the device gets its promised Amazon Alexa assistant.) Our winner will receive one brand new Huawei Mate 9 handset (US version), valued at $599.99. Unfortunately, this giveaway is US only as we will be shipping the prize ourselves, but we definitely have lots of giveaways in the plans that will be open to all of our international readers. How do you win? As we mentioned in the 9to5Rewards guide, just keep doing what you are doing! Each week, we’ll reward at least one comment, share, new subscription, or news tip with a giveaway prize. Winners and giveaways will be announced here and on our Twitter and Facebook accounts. Expect us to announce a winner around the time of next week’s giveaway. We read your insightful comments on our posts and on Twitter, Facebook and everywhere else that help inform what we cover. We get your news tips, which are so helpful for digging into stories and now we have a way to reward the best of the best. We also love when you share our stories on Twitter, Facebook and other mediums. And winners are also selected from our newsletter or YouTube signups, so make sure you’re onboard everywhere. We’re excited to give back to our best readers. Thanks again for allowing us to do what we love. One thing you could do to get started?

Internet by Terry Collins January 27, 2017 5:03 PM PST @terryscollins Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Getty Images Twitter on Friday released two national security letters it received from the FBI in the last two years that previously came with gag orders not to discuss them. In a blog post, the social network said it had been ordered by the feds to provide the name, address and other pertinent information of a user account in 2015, and another in 2016, and to not notify the users. In the released letters, the account names and the names of the specific investigating agencies were redacted. Twitter's action comes several weeks after tech companies including Google, Yahoo and Cloudflare published national security letters received from the FBI, some dating back to 2013. "Twitter remains unsatisfied with restrictions on our right to speak more freely about national security requests we may receive," wrote Elizabeth Banker, Twitter's associate general counsel. "We would like a meaningful opportunity to challenge government restrictions when 'classification' prevents speech on issues of public importance." Twitter sued the Justice Department in 2014 to lift any gag orders placed on the company regarding national security inquiries involving its users. Twitter said it was prohibited from disclosing how many letters it had received. The parties are due back in court next month.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Celebgate hacker who stole nude photos gets nine months in jail 27 Jan 2017 1 Celebrities, Data loss, Hacked, Law & order, Nude Celebrities, Phishing, Security threats Post navigation Previous: Data Privacy Day: know the risks of Amazon Alexa and Google Home Next: Pay for experts to rise as cybercrime ‘to cost $6tn a year by 2021’ by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Another Celebgate hacker is headed to jail. Edward Majerczyk, 29, pleaded guilty in September to prying open more than 300 iCloud and Gmail accounts – at least 30 of them belonging to Hollywood glitterati – and ripping off what the US Attorney’s Office demurely refers to as his victims’ “sensitive and private photographs and videos”. …which is what the rest of us call nude celebrity photos. On Tuesday, he was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, according to the Central District of California US Attorney’s Office. Majerczyk, who’s from Chicago, was sentenced by US District Judge Charles P Kocoras, who said his crime was “abhorrent”. As well the prison sentence – which he’ll begin serving at the end of February  – Judge Kocoras also ordered Majerczyk to pay $5,700 in restitution to one unnamed victim whose photos were published online. The charge is a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA, and specifically, one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information. Majerczyk was charged by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, but the case was transferred to the Northern District of Illinois, where he pleaded guilty and was sentenced. According to the plea agreement, Majerczyk was a busy phisherman between November 23 2013 through August 2014. That’s right before the September 2014 Celebgate gang-mugging of celebrities let loose, as intimate images of celebrities were stolen and disseminated online in places such as Reddit. Thieves and many equally scumbaggy photo-sharers trampled over the privacy of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Selena Gomez, Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Lea Michele and Hillary Duff, among others. Majerczyk got to his victims with a phishing scam in which he sent messages doctored to look like security notices from ISPs. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More The phishing messages led victims to a website that harvested their usernames and the passwords for their Google or iCloud accounts. With the credentials in hand, Majerczyk was free to romp through victims’ accounts and grab whatever photos and videos he could find. Nasty, eh? Oh yes, said Deirdre Fike, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office: Mr Majerczyk manipulated hundreds of victims by tricking them into providing access to their accounts, including high-profile victims whose information was specifically targeted. The lasting harm this type of intrusion can cause to celebrities and non-celebrities alike cannot be overstated… And it should serve as an important reminder to all of us of how dangerous it can be to respond to unsolicited e-mails in which our personal information is requested, Fike said. Majerczyk’s case followed a guilty plea by Pennsylvanian Ryan Collins, 36, who was sentenced to 18 months in jail in October. Both Majerczyk and Collins pulled the same shtick: sending phishing emails spoofed to look like they came from Apple or Google which asked victims for account credentials. We never heard the details of how they constructed the phishing emails, but October brought us a fascinating dissection of how hackers used Bitly shortened links in phishing attacks to trick Democratic National Committee officials into handing over their own Gmail credentials. The Feds have said that both Collins and Majerczyk were apparently operating independently and there is no evidence to suggest that either Majerczyk or Collins were the ones who actually posted the nude photos online. In another investigation sparked by Celebgate, the US government seized a Chicago man’s computers in June 2015. None of those cases, apparently, are related to yet another celebrity hacking prosecution: that of Alonzo Knowles’ guilty plea in New York for stealing new screenplays and sex videos from celebrities, nor of the felony hacking conviction of Andrew Helton in Oregon for similar hacking of celebrity-owned Apple and Google accounts. In other words, Majerczyk is just the latest in a string of busted, soon to be imprisoned celebrity hackers. Investigators sure don’t seem to be tired of chasing them down, though. All the better for the people they’ve victimized.

Is there any explanation for why restitution was ordered for only one of them? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Home World news FBI request for Twitter account data may have overstepped legal guidelines FBI request for Twitter account data may have overstepped legal guidelines The FBI appeared to go beyond the scope of existing legal guidance in seeking certain kinds of internet records from Twitter as recently as last year, legal experts said, citing two warrantless surveillance orders the social media company published on Friday. By: Reuters | Washington | Published: January 28, 2017 7:02 AM (Reuters) The FBI appeared to go beyond the scope of existing legal guidance in seeking certain kinds of internet records from Twitter as recently as last year, legal experts said, citing two warrantless surveillance orders the social media company published on Friday. Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet’s Google and Yahoo. Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo’s guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. “While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,” Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Aaron Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. “This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended,” said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of last year the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

Shares of the world's biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple's market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet's market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts' average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company's profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street's expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company's efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company's stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. "The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it "buy" or higher, eight have a "hold" rating and two "strong sell".

In Greenspon report, corporate media blames everything but itself By Nick Fillmore | January 27, 2017 Print Write to editor Support rabble Corrections What a difference some 50 years has made in one of Canada's most important and powerful industries! Back in 1970, the Senate of Canada called an inquiry to investigate the exorbitant profits made by Canada's handful of media barons. Skinflint media mogul Roy Thomson had declared that owning a radio or television station was like having a license to print money. He added that owning a newspaper was even better, because a license was not required. The Senators hemmed and hawed, and made some recommendations that were mostly ignored by the powerful media owners, who continued to make big profits. How times have changed. A report from the Public Policy Forum of Montreal, released on Thursday, says the Canadian news industry "is reaching a crisis point as the decline of traditional media, fragmentation of audiences and the rise of fake news pose a growing threat to the health of our democracy."   Whereas the 1970 report was entitled "The Uncertain Mirror," the new appeal for support is called "The Shattered Mirror." Now mainstream media are unable to sell enough advertising to provide the amount and quality of news coverage that once seemed routine. So giant corporations are humbly appealing to the federal government to provide support for various media and make adjustments to the media landscape. The report does not provide a specific prescription to bring corporate media back to health. Nothing in the report could even begin to provide the billions of dollars that would be needed to restore newspapers to what they were, say, 10 years ago. That was before corporations fired more than 10,000 journalists. Written by Eddie Greenspon, former Editor-in-Chief of The Globe and Mail, the most important request urges the federal government to impose a sales tax on U.S.-owned Internet media outlets, including Google and Facebook, operating in Canada. The estimated $400,000 would be used to create a Journalism and Democracy Fund, which would be managed independently from the government. The fund would be used to develop digital technology and pay for local news and investigative journalism. The federal government is likely to balk at this suggestion because most of the money would end up in the bank accounts of much-maligned media corporations. Greenspon's paper also would like changes to the Copyright Act to protect original content from being picked up on aggregator websites. Look out, Huffington Post. There are several other interesting suggestions in the report. Greenspon's bias toward corporate media is obvious when he says the CBC should not be allowed to run digital ads on its news sites. That would open up a measly $25-million for the rest of the media. Greenspon says the federal government should make up the shortfall for the CBC, but that's not going to happen. The author also says that CBC news content should be made available free of charge to outside news organizations. Hmmm, perhaps he hasn't noticed that media sites already do this. Corporate media whines that others are responsible for its woes. But a big part of the problem is now that Canadians are able to access a great many information sites, many have grown to mistrusts mainstream media. A public poll carried out for the study showed all media sectors performing poorly. Only 11 per cent of those polled said they totally trusted newspapers. Greenspon has the nerve to write that Canada needs mainstream media to protect democracy. In reality, mainstream media has a corporate and conservative bias that began with the introduction of neoliberalism in the early 1980s. All but one Canadian daily endorsed the election of Stephen Harper, who headed the most right-wing government in modern times. He also says the mainstream needs support to help weed out "false news," hinting it comes from places such as Google and Facebook. Yes, false news is a problem, but there's also the fact that mainstream media produced stories that are seriously biased. It also ignores whole groups in society. What will happen to Greenspon's 100-page appeal? It will be one of several salvos that will help slide the federal government toward providing support of some kind of support that is publicly acceptable. But there's a warning buried deep in the report. Pollster Allan Gregg says that a majority of people polled in connection with the Public Policy Forum report are dead-set against taxpayers propping up the media industry. Perhaps the most disliked person in the business is Paul Godfrey, who, by chopping and borrowing millions, still controls more than 200 Postmedia news outlets, including several big city dailies. Godfrey's total income in 2015 was $1.7 million. With Godfrey pulling down this kind of money, it would not look good to have Postmedia dipping into a Journalism and Democracy Fund. For sure Trudeau wants the still powerful big media to support him, just like it supported Stephen Harper. Even so, the government will tiptoe along many more months before deciding which actions are safe to take. Meanwhile, the once mighty big media companies will continue to twist in the wind. Nick Fillmore is a Toronto freelance journalist and media critic. In an earlier life, in 1970, when he was publisher of the upstart Halifax weekly, The 4th Estate, his presentation to the Special Senate Committee on Mass Media rocked the staid and backward corporate newspapers in the Maritimes. He described how they censored the news, paid low wages and treated staff with disdain. In response, the Halifax Chronicle-Herald published one of its few ever front page editorials with the headline: "A denigration of good men." Like this article?

We are a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a major contributor of NATO, and a member of the G7 and G20.” He said the finance sector employed more than two million people in the UK. “Nowhere else in Europe investors can find such a concentration of services, underpinned by a globally renowned justice system.” Speaking about how Pakistan and the UK collaborate on a variety of sectors, Parmley said the UK’s largest bilateral educational programme was administered in Pakistan. “This is a £800 million investment which has reduced the number of children-out-of-school, and introduced public-private partnerships.” According to him, the British Council Centre in Karachi is also one of the largest British academic centres in the world. “Additionally, 90 British universities participated in the higher education fair held last year in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad catering to over 3000 students.” He said the prevention of cyber-crime had the potential to become a huge industry in the future. “There are 20 banks in London dealing with Shariah compliant services, whilst 17 universities are teaching courses on Islamic finance.” 0 0 ‘London will not lose economic importance post-Brexit’ was posted in Karachi of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 28, 2017 and was last updated on January 28, 2017.

It also includes data security and data breach notification rules as well as a prohibition on making info sharing a quid pro quo for service and a case-by-case look at offering incentives to share info. The FCC will also preempt state privacy, data security and data breach laws that conflict with its new rules.   The groups also pointed to the fact that the framework applies to ISPs, but not edge providers, like Google and Facebook, and their collection and sharing of online information.   "Invoking Congress’s prerogative as provided in the CRA will help clear the way toward re-establishing a consistent, uniform set of privacy protections for consumers across the internet," they said.   ISPs want Congress to use its Congressional Review Act (CRA) powers to invalidate the order, a legislative mechanism being eyed by Republicans to take aim at various regulatory decisions dating from the previous administration. The act allows Congress to review and reverse government regulations.   While the letter went to the House and Senate minority leaders as well as to the House Speaker and Senate majority leader, Democrats are highly unlikely to support such a move. Two Democrats not on the letter have already publicly criticized the request--Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee.   Others signing on to the letter included the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), Consumer Technology Association, USTelecom, CTIA, and the Competitive Carriers Association.   “The FCC’s sweeping privacy Order is unprecedented and misguided and would be damaging to the entire online advertising ecosystem,” said Dan Jaffe, group EVP for ANA. “This massive attempted regulatory overreach by the FCC, if not overturned, will confront consumers with an avalanche of annoying and unhelpful advertising and breach notices. These rules are unnecessary because highly-effective existing privacy self-regulatory programs such as those carried out by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) already provide the necessary consumer transparency, notice and choice for interest-based advertising.”   ISP-backed Net Competition, Americans for Tax Reform, and a host of small-government groups earlier in the week called on the same congressional leaders to use the CRA to invalidate the FCC framework order.   Want to read more stories like this?

Twitter said its disclosures were the first time the company had been allowed to publicly reveal the secretive orders, which were delivered with gag orders when they were issued in 2015 and 2016. Their publication follows similar disclosures in recent months by other major internet companies, including Alphabet's Google and Yahoo. Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo's guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. "While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice," Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. "This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended," said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of last year the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

The organization was created to help shape the future of artificial intelligence technology in an open way. Apple joins Partnership on AI as a founding member Tom Gruber is Apple’s representative on the organization’s Board of Trustees. He co-founded Siri in 2007 and launched the company’s voice-controlled interface. The company was bought in 2010 by Apple and Siri is now part of both iOS and macOS. Mr. Gruber’s involvement in artificial intelligence goes back years. zAfter receiving his M.S. in Computer and Information Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst he served as a Research Associate, and later as Senior Project Leader for Enterprise Integration Technology, at the Knowledge Systems Laboratory of the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. Along with Mr. Gruber, Greg Corrado from Google/DeepMind, Ralf Herbrich from Amazon, Eric Horvitz from Microsoft, Yann Lecun from Facebook, and Francesca Rossi from IBM joined the Board of Trustees. The Board also includes independent non-corporate trustees from OpenAI, the American Civil Liberties Union, UC Berkley, the MacArthur Foundation, the Peterson Institute of International Economics, and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence & ASU. Apple Opens up About Artificial Intelligence Apple recently changed its closed door policy on sharing AI-related research and has already let its engineers publish their first paper. In that paper, Apple described a way to enhance object recognition for computer systems learning facial details and other objects. For Apple, more open involvement in the AI community could prove to be a big benefit for its own Siri technology. Apple is seen as falling behind in AI and voice control thanks to Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. Both are powerful and compelling voice interfaces, but they still require humans to learn how to the right words and phrases instead of letting the computer adapt and learn what we mean. Current voice control systems also lack a deep understanding of context, which makes them more difficult to interact with in a natural way. The Partnership on AI will look at those shortcomings as well as the social and personal implications of deeper computer understanding. The organization’s first meeting is set for Friday, February 3rd in San Francisco. We’ll know more about their path, as well as how other people can get involved, soon after.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: TRANSPORTATION Guest How to democratize the connected car Russell Ure, Klashwerks January 27, 2017 4:10 PM Tags: ai, connected cars, Internet of things, Klashwerks, transportation Above: Adobe's marketing cloud gets new features to deliver and test messages to connected devices, like cars. Image Credit: Adobe The Internet of Things is evidently no longer a buzzword but a reality quickly evolving — and anything that can be leveraged for the new infrastructure, from smart traffic lights to connected cars, will be consumed by it. The connected car, particularly with the rise of IoT, has been a nexus for new activity in the past few years. Tesla, Google, Uber … the list of companies pushing the boundaries of smart travel and connected, even autonomous, cars is growing by the day. And the idea of their success is welcomed by most. Who doesn’t like a future in which being stuck in traffic means the possibility of a nap before the workday? The end goal is an in-car connected experience that rivals the one we have in the home. But will this only be available for new models hitting the production line? It doesn’t have to be. There is a natural progression of smart tech from the home to the car. More specifically, we can expect some interesting new car-focused technology, from aftermarket changes to truly affordable smart cars, as automotive manufacturers try to keep pace with the changing expectations of the market. Extending the smart home I’ve had a passion for cars ever since I can remember. In fact, it’s still such a part of my life that I own a Mercedes convertible in Ottawa. Yes, a convertible in Canada that I can’t drive for half the year. It’s a great car, with great engineering. Yet there has always been something lacking in how I interact with it. Although cars are important elements in many people’s lives, our connection to them only really occurs when we sit behind the wheel. In Knight Rider, KITT was always connected and ready to serve. It is that concept of connectivity and intelligence that has inspired many — including us at Klashwerks — to create a solution that will enable us to connect to our cars in ways that were previously not possible. People are already having these kinds of relationships with their home via smart cameras, kitchen appliances, product suites like those offered by Nest, and more. It’s time for it to happen in the car space. The connected car really feels like a natural extension of the connected home. But so far, only the home can be retrofitted and upgraded, while cars get left in behind. Fortunately, efforts are being made to change that. Old cars don’t have to be dumb The automotive industry itself is under revolutionary changes right now. It is also a reflection of what our future might look like in terms of technology — electric power over fossil fuels; artificial intelligence and connectivity over isolation. Particularly, the potential growth for aftermarket products that support smart features is going to be high in the upcoming years, especially as we’re seeing cars lifespan continually increase. Also automobile manufacturers will find it extremely challenging to fight innovation wars being fought on so many different fronts: advanced drivetrains, driver automation, composite materials, lighting systems, etc. So not only will consumers spur this aftermarket growth, but so will manufacturers. Of note is that the growth in the aftermarket product space won’t just focus on cool new connected gadgets, but features that make the driving experience more comfortable, convenient and, most importantly, safe. A lot of the current automotive technology will be around for a long time, which creates an opportunity for aftermarket manufacturers to provide new levels of functionality that are accessible to all drivers, including cameras and mobile connectivity. Ultimately, smart technology is making the rounds, becoming ingrained in daily processes from our commutes to our workflows. The automation and seeming intelligence IoT devices display have made them a huge benefit, as they simplify traditionally tedious tasks. Smart step counters help you stay fit, smart traffic lights have improved traffic flow, autonomous features can make your drive to work easier, and supercomputers are becoming involved in the diagnostic process for human illness. The list goes on and on. IoT adoption across many industries is ongoing, but now this revolution is moving to the automotive space. The good news is that you will not have to buy a new car to enjoy these new capabilities, and we can expect a busy year ahead for the connected car.

 Snapchat is reportedly seeking $200 million commitments from ad agencies — here's what that means for its IPO Lara O'Reilly Jan. 26, 2017, 5:18 AM 3,509 facebook linkedin twitter email print Evan Spiegel, Snap Inc. CEO. Samantha Lee/Business Insider As Snap Inc. accelerates towards its IPO, the company is reportedly meeting with ad agencies to seek huge commitments of their clients' ad spend for 2017. Snap chief strategy officer Imran Khan and global head of sales Jeff Lucas are asking for amounts of between $100 million and $200 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. That would see the biggest advertising group, WPP, more than double its $90 million spend on Snapchat from 2016. WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell told Business Insider earlier this month his firm had only expected to spend within the region of $20 million to $30 million at the beginning of 2016. Other advertising holding companies would also be significantly upping — likely tripling — their spend even to reach the $100 million mark. Snap declined to comment. Here's how advertising commitments work Media-buying companies very, very rarely guarantee a level of spend with any media owner. Nevertheless, all the big platforms — Facebook, Google, TV companies, newspaper groups — pursue upfront deals with agencies. What those platforms are looking for is an expression of intent, in writing. But it is unusual for there to be a 100% guaranteed level of spend. For media platforms like Snap, gathering these expressions of intent gives them a clearer idea as to what their revenue run rate might be for the following year. Snap, in particular, is keen to show potential investors in its IPO that its revenue outlook is strong, and growing. It is also in the agencies' interests to sign these contracts because it helps them set a framework for how they will work with the platforms in the year ahead.  The most immediate benefit is pricing, which tends to be tiered: If you're committing to spend $100 million a year, you'll tend to pay less per ad than if you were spending just $20 million. But it's not just pricing. The nuance of such deals — which can often get lost in the big upfront numbers — is that the platforms usually agree to give agencies a certain level of account management, data, or first access to tech, depending on how much they pay. However, while the agencies are signing these expressions of intent in good faith, it's very hard for media-buying agencies to really commit their clients' dollars in advance. For that reason, there is usually some sort of get-out for the agency. For example, in 2007 and 2008, following the global financial crisis, many companies decided to limit their spend on advertising. Also, advertisers may simply change their strategies and want to go after different audiences. And some agency groups could lose a big client, which would immediately result in the reduction of their overall spend with a media platform. That usually leads to the media platform levying some sort of penalty on the agency. Advertising commitments are a fairly good predictor of actual spend. The media buyers we spoke to said they tend to make their commitments quite a conservative number that they usually do reach by the end of the year. But, to use a retail analogy, they are not forward-order numbers that Snap can take to the bank.   Snap's big pitch to IPO investors is all about showing growth Snap will no doubt be using these numbers in its pitch to investors as it looks to convince them it can build a big, sustainable ads business to rival the likes of Google and Facebook.  Snapchat has 150 million daily active users, an amount now equaled by Instagram's very similar disappearing video and photo sharing feature Stories, which the Facebook-owned app launched in August.  Snap's Khan will not only need to convince investors that its revenue is growing, but that its userbase is increasing, and that its userbase in nuanced enough and more engaged with Snapchat than other platforms, which will encourage advertisers to continue spending. New data points from eMarketer might throw up some uncomfortable questions about whether Snap's userbase is still growing. EMarketer suggests fewer internet users in the US said they watched live streaming video in November 2016 compared to June 2016: eMarketer And fewer US teens said they accessed Snapchat daily in November 2016, compared with November 2015, according to eMarketer: eMarketer EMarketer predicts that Snapchat generated $367 million in ad revenue last year and that it is on course to get close to $1 billion in 2017. Snap has moved quickly to build out measurement and targeting options to encourage advertisers to spend more money there. Most recently, the company signed a deal with Oracle Data Cloud, that will allow advertisers to use offline data, such as information from loyalty cards, to target consumers on Snapchat. Snap now partners with more than a dozen measurement companies as it looks to prove to advertisers that it is not only a viable alternative to Google and Facebook — a duopoly advertisers and agencies are longing to become less dominant — but that advertising with Snapchat actually boosts their sales. If it can successfully do that, then Snap is set for a bumper IPO.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 28, 2017 Stadium Sized Cellphone Light Show Is Controlled By Sound 7 Comments by: Adam Fabio January 27, 2017 18 months ago, [Jameson Rader] didn’t know how to code. He had an economics degree and worked for a minor league hockey team. He did have a dream, though. Broadcasting data through sound. When we say broadcast, we mean broadcast – as in one sender and thousands of receivers. [Jameson] didn’t have the money to hire a team to build his application. So he did what any self-respecting hacker would do. He bought a few books and taught himself to code. We’re talking about a smartphone app here, so Java and Objective-C were necessary to cover Android and iOS devices. The result is XT Audio Beacons. [Jameson] has created a light show for stadiums which requires no new hardware infrastructure. Ultrasonic cues are added to a pre-recorded soundtrack and played over the PA system. Fans attending the show simply run an app and hold up their smartphone. The app listens for the cues and turns on the camera flash. The result is a light show which can be synchronized to music, sound effects, or whatever the event calls for. Since the system relies on sound, the App only needs permissions to access the microphone. The system would still work even if the phones were in airplane mode. Transmitting data to smartphones via ultrasonics isn’t exactly new. Amazon uses it in their Dash Buttons, and Google uses it in their OnHub. Using it as a broadcast medium in a stadium is a novel application, though. [Jameson] also has demos showing XT Audio Beacons being used for more mundane purposes – such as troubleshooting electronics, or even as an acoustic version of an iBeacon. Most important here is that [Jameson] isn’t keeping all this new knowledge to himself. He’s published the source to his application on Github under the MIT license. You can see the system in action – and even try it yourself, in the video after the break. If you want to learn more about [Jameson] and his journey, definitely check out his AMA on Reddit.

A step before that could be a ring of speakers aimed at the spectators with the ultrasonic signals selectively played.

Report comment Reply Lars R. says: January 27, 2017 at 10:50 pm It’s scary. It’s wrong. Sounds like it is going to become the next big thing (or it already is). Even scarier. I am glad someone showed us and even provides the source code. Report comment Reply rutigrem says: January 28, 2017 at 12:45 am scary ? wrong ? why that ? Report comment Reply Tinfoil Hatmaker says: January 28, 2017 at 1:31 am It is scary and wrong to lure people into installing apps that feed us commercials. It is even scarier and more wrong when websites embedd the ultrasonic sound so that your phone checks in with them every time you visit a website. It is already in use to track phedofiles that watches porn, their phones connect to a server where their identity is saved, and the phones identity is coupled with the computer, witch I can support in that only case. But when someone stealthly implement it to save your identity when you visit an political partys website, it suddenly becomes dangerous. Who is tracking you, and why? What are they going to do with the data gathered? What if someone else gets hold of the data, a foreign country? Things that run stealt on your phone and listen with the microphone can do a lot of damage. Report comment Reply rnjacobs says: January 27, 2017 at 11:02 pm I found demodulating the “Starter Triggers” in the github repository (i.e. modulation by the nyquist rate) to be really informative. Report comment Reply John says: January 28, 2017 at 1:40 am Think I missed something. Watched the video and have no idea what this is at all other than a phone that lights up and some circles changing colour on a pc or phone or something with a screen on.

Hide Caption 22 of 22 (CNN)A flat-pack refugee shelter developed by Ikea and the United Nations has been named the best design of 2016. Awarded the Beazley Design of the Year award, presented by the Design Museum in London, the modular Better Shelter is made from recyclable plastic, comprises only 68 components, and can be assembled in as few as four hours. Each structure is large enough to house a family of five, and includes a solar panel to power lights and charge devices. Since production started in 2015, 16,000 units have been delivered to countries around the world including Iraq, Djibouti, Greece and Niger, to be used as homes, temporary clinics and offices. Is London Europe's cultural capital? "Better Shelter tackles one of the defining issues of the moment: providing shelter in an exceptional situation whether caused by violence or disaster," said juror Jana Scholze, an associate professor of curating contemporary design at Kingston University, in a statement.

It shows the power of design to respond to the conditions we are in and transform them."

We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That’s who we are.” Replay Video U.S. intelligence captured Russian officials’ communications celebrating Trump’s victory The Post’s Adam Entous reports that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted electronic communications, known as “signals intelligence,” in which top Russian officials celebrated the outcome of the U.S. election. The Washington Post Despite a 'War on Pollution,' Beijing is facing its smoggiest days yet Over the New Year weekend, a wave of smog rolled into China's capital city of Beijing. Resident's here are calling it "airpocalypse," as the skies darken and air quality is rated at hazardous levels. Even digital pollution meters in homes rated the indoor air-quality as poor. The Washington Post Which way is Siberia? The answer is harder than you think. The Washington Post's Moscow bureau chief, David Filipov, goes looking for Siberia. The Washington Post SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Zuckerberg also prodded Trump to stand by earlier statements regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) and H1-B visas, which are of particular concern to tech companies that use the visas to hire talent from overseas. “I was glad to hear President Trump say he’s going to ‘work something out’ for Dreamers – immigrants who were brought to this country at a young age by their parents,” he wrote. “I’m also glad the President believes our country should continue to benefit from ‘people of great talent coming into the country.’” Zuckerberg’s statement, though restrained, is notable at a time when the rest of Silicon Valley appears to be rushing to fall in line with the Trump administration. RELATED: Trump suspends U.S. refugee program, suspends entry from some countries Tech leaders overwhelmingly opposed Trump’s candidacy during the campaign, citing his xenophobia, protectionism, “poor judgment and ignorance about how technology works”. Zuckerberg himself took a veiled swipe at Trump in April 2016, saying “I hear fearful voices talking about building walls … It takes courage to chose hope over fear,” at a conference. But following Trump’s surprise election, tech leaders quickly changed their tune, offering up congratulations and – in Zuckerberg’s case – platitudes about “feeling hopeful”. Top executives from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and other countries travelled to Trump Tower in December to make nice with the president-elect. Tesla’s Elon Musk and Uber’s Travis Kalanick joined Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum to advise him on his economic agenda. Google co-hosted a party for Republican lawmakers with the right-wing Independent Journal Review, the New York Times reported, while Facebook hosted an inauguration party with the right-wing Daily Caller. While it’s not surprising that major corporations would curry favor with the party in power, Zuckerberg has previously spoken out about progressive issues, such as defending the Black Lives Matter movement. The CEO has recently raised suspicions that he harbors political aspirations. Zuckerberg’s post was personal, referencing his own great-grandparents, who immigrated from Germany, Austria and Poland, and his wife’s parents, who were refugees from China and Vietnam. “We are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here,” he wrote in a passage that will not allay anyone’s suspicions that he plans to run for elected office.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The social media company has announced that it will now support FIDO U2F security key, which is a physical key that is plugged in a USB-port on a computer and tapped to confirm login along with the password. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Explaining on a blog, Facebook Security team said that using the key will make accounts immune to hackers. The blog also explained how codes sent over text messages (SMS) aren’t always reliable and ‘having a phone back-up available may not work well for everyone’. Using security keys for two-factor authentication has a number of benefits: 1. Your login becomes immune to phishing because you physically don’t enter a code yourself, instead the hardware providing cryptographic proof. 2. Security keys supporting U2F will not just work for Facebook accounts, but can also support online accounts of Google, GitHub, Drobox, Salesforce and others. 3. Logging in becomes fast and simple on your desktop, thanks to just a tap on the key after you enter your password. Read: Facebook gives social support, Twitter knowledge: Study “Security keys for Facebook logins currently only work with certain web browsers and mobile devices, so we’ll ask you to also register an additional login approval method, such as your mobile phone or Code Generator.To add a security key from your computer, you’ll need to be using the latest version of Chrome or Opera. At this time we don’t support security key logins for our mobile Facebook app, but if you have an NFC-capable Android device with the latest version of Chrome and Google Authenticator installed, you can use an NFC-capable key to log in from our mobile website,” the Facebook team said on the blog. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Facebook Budget 2017 BusinessArun Jaitley should focus on job creation in Budget: Rating agency Crisil Budget must be presented after assembly elections: Akhilesh Yadav writes to PM Modi OpinionLook at budget algebra, not math Best of Express J-K: Five soldiers feared trapped after Army post caved in under snow in Kupwara district EntertainmentAlia Bhatt, Hrithik Roshan, Karan Johar stand with Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

By India Ashok January 28, 2017 07:33 GMT US President Donald Trump signing an executive order at the Oval OfficeGetty Images A leaked White House document reportedly reveals that President Donald Trump is set to order a 60-day cybersecurity review. The leaked draft of the executive cybersecurity order reveals the Trump administration is looking to probe America's current cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities in efforts to boost the cyber defence capabilities, according to reports. The draft highlights the US government's persistent stance on the significance of cyberspace as a national resource, a concept that the previous administration also shared, the Washington Post reported. The document notes that the internet is a "vital national resource" and that cyberspace is undergoing "constant, rapid changes as a result of the pace of technological innovation." The document also states the America's government organisations and critical infrastructure are "vulnerable to attacks from both state and non-state actors" which can lead to "significant costs on the US economy and significantly harm vital national interests", which in turn could see "significant property damage and loss of life." The document also noted that the government agencies tasked with protecting government networks and critical infrastructure "are not currently organized to act collectively/collaboratively, tasked, or resourced, or provided with legal authority adequate to succeed in their missions." In comparison to the Obama administration, the Trump administration's stance toward cybersecurity policies appears to be more authoritarian in nature. The draft indicates that likelihood of agencies receiving greater resources and more legal power over networks under the Trump administration is much higher than before. The document also goes on to detail and define what falls under "national security system" and "critical infrastructure". However, the relatively vague wording does not provide much clarity on whether private networks of the likes of Google, Amazon and others may also be deemed under such classifications. The draft does however clarify that the cybersecurity review will come with recommendations, to be provided in 60 days. The recommendations will include "the enhanced protection of the most critical civilian Federal Government, public, and private sector infrastructure, other than US national security systems." The recommendations are also expected to detail whether government agencies are "appropriately organized, tasked, and resourced, and provided with adequate legal authority necessary to fulfill their missions."

BlackBerry Mobile announced this week that a new phone - complete with a physical keyboard and dubbed the "Mercury" - will debut Febuary 25 at the annual Mobile World Congress trade show. That follows hard on the heels of an announcement from Nokia, which teased the Chinese launch of its new Nokia 6 phone ahead of a larger Febuary 26 launch event. Nokia? BlackBerry? What's next, the return of Baby-G watches? It may all feel a bit 2002 seeing these phone brands come back into the spotlight, but here's the thing: These are not the phone brands that you think they are. Both of the new smartphones are made by different companies than the ones we knew and loved, as a result of complicated licensing agreements. Read also: BlackBerry's keyboard is back for one last dance The company you know as BlackBerry - Canadian, security-conscious - is focusing its efforts on software to augment smartphones and its auto efforts via QNX - a part of the firm that makes smart dashboard software and has its own self-driving car prototype. While BlackBerry designed the Mercury in-house, it and all other BlackBerry phones will be made and sold by Chinese tech giant TCL. A different company And Nokia is no longer the company that rose to prominence with its old feature phones, though it still makes telecom equipment and other consumer gadgets. But since Microsoft sold Nokia off, the rights to make Nokia-branded phones belong to HMD, another Chinese tech company. Both firms are trying to make a bigger mark in a global smartphone market that's still largely dominated by Apple and Samsung. Picking up a well-known- if slightly dusty - brand from the earlier days of mobile phones is one way to do that. But don't expect exactly the same experience that you had before. Both phones also represent a capitulation of sorts to Google. BlackBerry and Nokia held out for a while using non-Android operating systems for years. (Nokia and BlackBerry each had their own systems for a while. Nokia also moved to Windows Phone while it was owned by Microsoft.) Both failed, in part because they couldn't keep up with the app selection from Apple and Google, as most developers were only interested in making programs for those two platforms. With both phones now using Android, that won't be an issue anymore. Of course, consumers will have to hear more details about these phones before we can judge whether either comeback will work. The success or failure of a phone depends more on its features, price and value than on whether it gives you warm fuzzies by reminding you of tech days gone by. But if you're looking to rock a little retro this year, this could be one way to do it.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Society Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg takes on Donald Trump, challenges his orders on immigration and 'extreme vetting' Zuckerburg also urged Trump to stand true to his earlier presidential campaign vows regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) and H1-B visas. Namrata Tripathi   January 28, 2017 12:51 IST Faebook CEO Mark ZuckerbergReuters Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday denounced United States President Donald Trump's executive orders, which will severely restrict entry for immigrants and refugees from Muslim-majority countries. Also read: Trump signs orders on 'extreme vetting,' bars refugee entry from 7 Muslim countries "Like many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat ... We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That's who we are," Zuckerberg said. The Facebook CEO has now become the most high-profile tech industry leader to speak out against the US president ever since the 2016 elections. Zuckerburg, however, also urged Trump to stand true to his earlier presidential campaign vows regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) and H1-B visas. H1-B visas are in particular of great interest to the tech industry as the said visas assist in hiring talent from other countries into US. "I was glad to hear President Trump say he's going to 'work something out' for Dreamers – immigrants who were brought to this country at a young age by their parents. I'm also glad the President believes our country should continue to benefit from 'people of great talent coming into the country," Zuckerberg wrote. During Trump's presidential campaign, tech leaders from Silicon Valley opposed his candidacy, citing the Republican billionaire's xenophobia, protectionism, poor judgement and ignorance about how technology works. However, some of those very leaders now seem to be rushing to fall in line with Trump's administration now that he is the US President. However, Zuckerberg has stood his ground when it comes to his take on some of Trump's standings. The Facebook CEO during a press conference in April 2016 had said, "I hear fearful voices talking about building walls ... It takes courage to chose hope over fear." Zuckerberg in his post also wrote about his own ancestors who immigrated from Germany, Austria and Poland and his wife's parents, who were refugees from China and Vietnam. "We are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here," he wrote. Top executives from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and other companies travelled to Trump Tower in December to meet Trump. Tesla's Elon Musk and Uber's Travis Kalanick joined Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum to advise him on his economic agenda. Google co-hosted a party for Republican lawmakers with the right-wing Independent Journal Review, according to the New York Times, while Facebook hosted an inauguration party with the right-wing Daily Caller. Trump on Friday signed executive orders to suspend refugee arrivals from at least seven Muslim countries and to impose stricter new controls on travellers from these nations. Trump, during his presidential campaign, had declared that he would weed out "radical Islamic terrorists" from America, and after signing the order he said that he was making the nation safe from the "terrorists." The order reportedly states that no visas are to be issued for at least 30 days to migrants or travellers from seven Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

 US STOCKS-Wall St little changed as earnings, GDP data disappoint Reuters Jan. 27, 2017, 1:01 PM 101 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Fourth-quarter GDP up 1.9 pct vs. est. 2.2 pct * Starbucks lower after cutting revenue forecast * Chevron down after profit falls short of estimates * All three major indexes on track to post weekly gains * Indexes down: Dow 0.04 pct, S&P 0.10 pct, Nasdaq 0.02 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Tanya Agrawal Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed on Friday as investors paused after a recent rally following underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.2 percent to $113.98 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The Nasdaq was weighed down by Starbucks, whose shares dropped 3.6 percent to $56.34 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. "They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump's policies and the new administration's ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. "There's definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress." said Lyon. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1735 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.74 points, or 0.04 percent, at 20,092.17. The S&P 500 was down 2.47 points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,294.21 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.91 points, or 0.02 percent, at 5,654.27. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.99 percent fall leading the decliners. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to $65.72, while Intel gained 1.4 percent to $38.09 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet was down 0.8 percent at $850.35 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. American Airlines fell 5 percent to $47.10 after the No. 1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic reported a fall in profit. Colgate-Palmolive fell 5.9 percent to $64.20 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,768 to 1,047. On the Nasdaq, 1,628 issues fell and 1,075 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 24 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 23 new lows.

 US STOCKS-Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings Reuters Jan. 27, 2017, 4:17 PM 12 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Fourth-quarter GDP up 1.9 pct vs est. 2.2 pct * Chevron down after profit falls short of estimates * All three major indexes on track to post weekly gains * Dow off 0.04 pct, S&P down 0.09 pct, Nasdaq up 0.1 pct (Updates to mid-afternoon, changes byline) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower for a second consecutive session on Friday as some underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data offset recent enthusiasm over policy actions by President Donald Trump. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.4 percent to $113.79 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The S&P energy index, down 0.9 percent, was the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors. Starbucks curbed gains on the Nasdaq. Its shares dropped 4.0 percent to $56.12 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "The market has rallied on expectations of good things to happen in the future but as we are getting the data that is factual of what is going on, it is not as good as people are hoping," said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago. "Which tells you, this earnings recovery that is expected in 2017, a good chunk of it is already baked into the market." Even with some disappointing corporate results, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to show growth of 6.8 percent, which would mark the biggest increase in two years and second straight quarter of growth, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow remained above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. For the week, the Dow rose 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,093.78, the S&P 500 lost 1.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,294.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,660.78. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to $65.78, while Intel gained 1.1 percent to $37.98 after both reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet lost 1.4 percent to $845.03 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive slumped 5.2 percent to $64.68 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 26 new lows. About 5.81 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.56 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: January 28, 2017 10:58 am Alia Bhatt will be seen next in Badrinath Ki Dulhania co-starring Varun Dhawan. There is a reason why Alia Bhatt is one of the most popular stars of her generation. She is easy going, stylish and all over the social media. From updating her holiday’s pictures on Instagram to sending out messages on Twitter, there’s little Alia is not doing right now. In fact, this globetrotting star is doing almost everything in the capacity of a budding superstar. She is one actor who makes headlines even when she is yawning in one corner of her newly-acquired flat in Mumbai. The actor recently shot for Vogue India and gave a candid interview. Unlike other interviews, this conversation was more frank and naughtier. It has shades of her personality and mind. The actor poured her heart out on subjects as varying as stealing things from her sister’s wardrobe. In a quintessential Alia style, the actor confessed that she knows the password of her boyfriend’s mobile. When asked who is the most genuine actor in Bollywood, Alia says, “Akshay Kumar.” Alia also revealed the weirdest things she searched on Google. “Recently in Europe, I was craving dosa, so I looked that up but nothing turned up. Also, now that I’ve moved into my new house, I have white tiles in my bathroom that I noticed were getting dirty around the edges. So I googled ‘how to take out stains from small hexagonal-shaped tiles’. Later the answer, of course, came from mum,” Alia said in the interview. Alia also revealed that she has stolen a vintage coin collection from her sister’s wardrobe. You will be surprised to know that the actor has also, once, stolen a pillow from an ad film’s set.

However, not all of these options come for free. If you don’t have the funds to pay for cinema tickets, or would just rather spend your cash on other things, don’t worry. There are free movie download sites all over the internet, but the quality of these sites varies greatly. So, to get the best of what’s available, take a look at this list of sites we’ve tried and tested to save you time. If you’d rather download a movie to watch now or later, rather than live stream, you should check out the following sites. These will give you what you are looking for in your search for somewhere to watch free movies online. Watch Series Online Yesmovies.to The ads free popular site that you will want to check out is yesmovies.to. It’s a well-established site with lots to offer from a variety of international as well as domestic studios. Recommended !!!! The site is well maintained and frequently updated with new features, however, in order to keep the thing running, the developers have put advertisements on the site. While you can block these ads, they are also small enough in number to be relatively unobtrusive. Solid and reliable, a worthy addition to the list. Ads Free- Guaranteed streaming Ozoomic.com Ozoomic is one of the best sites to watch free movies online. It has a tonne of features. I am a big fan of this site as they keep on adding new movies and they are keen to progress. They have a very large database. Moreover, there are minimal obtrusive ads- No popups and other annoying things. Just a clean and fast site. They provide a really good user experience. Moreover, this site has a very beautiful and nice design. I especially like the way they categorised all the movies in terms of their year of releases. In conclusion, it is one my favourite site to watch free movies online. Openload.be Openload is a new site with a clean design. The design is similar to fmovies. New site with good movies. Latest movies are available as well. I seriously like their featured movie area. With a unique category IMDB top movies, the site is leaving behind its competitors. You can request the movies as well. I would prefer to register there. They have many servers including one from vodlocker. They have embedded the video player from many sites with a good collection of movies. I hope it will grow fast 123movies.is 123movies is a great free online movie website. The site reliably streams the latest movies on its fast server in HD quality. Unfortunately, the site is marred by redirecting ads, but these ads are the norm for this type of site, providing the only source of revenue. 123movies is frequently updated, and even streams free movies mere days after their release. One of the best free movie websites to watch free movies online without downloading. You should definitely stop by the site and give it a try if live movie streams are what you are after. UPDATE: This site may be blocked in your country. To access it, use  proxysite.com PUTLOCKERS.ch If you’re looking for downloads of the latest movies, but you’re not having much luck finding solutions online, then this site has the answers. Putlocker9.com lets you view the latest sites and series’ from around the globe. Some slight downsides are that you have to wait quite a while for streams to load, and the number of movies on offer is not as large as on some other sites. That being said, putlocker9.com does present you with one of the simplest user interfaces for this type of site.  Once registered, you can watch all the latest movies online in HD, and even view a broad selection of television series’ too. All videos are located on the sites own server, so you don’t have to worry about following, unknown external links. Vodlocker.ch Vodlocker is another amazing movie site to watch movies online free. This site provides good user experience. Furthermore, vodlocker has a nice design with good features. It contains fewer ads in comparison to some of the other sites. Vodlocker supports queries very well as they have a really large database of movies. You can watch any movies online here They even have latest movies available. The video players are embedded from different sites. It is a very popular site to watch movies online. I would recommend this site to those who wants to watch latest HD movies online Dubbed Anime CRACKLE.com Crackle is a 100% free movie download site that has been getting a lot of attention recently. The site lets you watch movies and television shows, and view exclusive content completely free of charge. The content available can be viewed and streamed via any media device to your television if you don’t want to watch it on your computer. Crackle is a fantastic platform to watch free movies online, and the site continues to grow with constant updates and new content. And don’t forget… it’s 100% free! SNAGFILMS.com Snagfilms is an excellent website for those looking to satisfy their need to watch free movies online. It provides a great platform and user experience,  meaning it ranks as one of the best free movie websites to watch free movies online. If you’re a fan of independent cinema, then you’ll definitely want to check this option out. Offering a wide selection of movies from around the globe, the films on the site are categorised into subsections, and there’s something for every taste. Ads are used to support the site’s running costs, but regardless, if you’re looking to watch free movies online, this site provides one of the best destinations on your journey. UPDATE: They changed their interface a lot. The new site is speedy as well clean. Quite cool look makes it very much unique from other sites. Also you can try their mobile apps as well. Videomega.ch video mega is a beautiful site that offers an extensive collection of movies and an awesome interface from which to find what you are looking for The movies on this site are provided via external links, hence download times are a little sluggish compared to some of its peers, and occasionally you may be redirected to an ad site. video mega is a great site to watch movies online for free. However, we mark it down because of the annoying ads, and therefore it is not strictly considered by us to be among the best free movie websites to watch free movies online. UPDATE: They have quite clean design but not that attractive. Music downloader free LoZoly.com  Another great site on our list of websites to watch free movies online. It is a fantastic site. The movies on the site are categorised chronologically, which is a great aid in finding the film you are looking for and is particularly useful for nostalgia lovers.  It should be noted that the site uses external streaming, which does impact on its’ user experience. An attractive and solid looking site. Not one to pass up on your hunt for a free night’s entertainment! Housemovie.to Housemovies is a staple on all lists of the best free movie websites, and for good reason. Running on an incredibly fast server, it gives you access to the very latest movies in high quality and provides a platform for movie fanatics to meet and chat about their favorite flicks.  A comprehensive review system also aids you in finding the most suitable movie before you commit to downloading. While ads are present on this site, their presence is not overwhelming and doesn’t detract from the many pros of using this free movie website. Solarmovie.sc Solarmovie is one of the most welcoming and easy to use free movie websites.  It doesn’t host movies and relies on external links. Unfortunately, while it does have an extensive range of links, the majority are dead or lead to junk ads. While for this reason, it may not be among the best free movie websites to watch free movies online,  it is nonetheless quite a reliable site that is free of pop-up ads and runs forums which allow users a  way to discuss and provide feedback about the site. Primewire.ag PrimeWire is not one of the best sites to watch free movies online Prime Wire is still a valid option. The site has a good user interface that filters out irrelevant movies, and rates all but the very latest movies. It is a growing site which is gaining popularity, and it’s putting its best efforts into improving its user experience. Still, the site needs significant improvement in terms of link assessment. Vumoo.li Vumoo offers an awesome user experience and, whilst still at an early stage of development and not completely bug-free, even gives you the option to access 4k HD movies. The site has a unique and attractive appearance and provides you with both externally linked as well as the site hosted movies, allowing them to supply an enormous collection of films. The only downer for this site is that it is slow to update with the latest movies, this is the major factor that prevents it from surpassing the other movie download sites. But still, it is a fantastic site to visit to watch free movies online. Update: Movies on the site featuring a bolt icon will stream faster with no ads. They Changed their interface a little bit. But a fixed ad in the corner is a big problem. Torrent sites Losmovies.club Losmovies is a good looking site that offers a variety of filter options, such as English subtitles and 3D movies. It is a great bookmark for those who spend a great deal of time watching films. The site is built around external, filtered links which are checked for validity and rated. These links take you to streams of the latest movies presented in HD quality, and a brief description of each film is also provided. Losmovies is one of the easiest to use and most reliable free movie websites. The only problem is that does use redirecting ads. But that’s the only notable drawback of the site, so don’t pass it up. POPCORNFLIX.com Established way back in 1999, Popcornflix offers an impressive independent library of around 1500 movies. All available to you completely free of charge. Whilst the site does fall behind its peers in terms of supplying the latest releases, TV shows are also freely accessible on their server.  And, best of all, as it depends on the Google Ads network for its’ income, the site is completely free of frustrating pop-ups and redirecting ads. UPDATE: The site app is available on the Play store and iTunes, and the user interface has recently been updated with new features. Tubitv.com Tubitv is totally free to use and puts forth an excellent collection of movies in a comprehensive range of genres.  This site is growing fast and will without a doubt soon become one of the most popular sites to watch free movies online. Tubitv is also home to an extensive collection of documentaries, TV shows, and series.  Downsides? Well, you won’t be guaranteed to find the latest movie releases here, but if that doesn’t bother you, this site should be at the top of your list of great places to watch free movies online. Wolowtube.cc A search engine based site which crawls and indexes links to online movies. Great, but many of the links do not work, and the available selection of films is not that large to start with. It needs serious improvement but does bring something new to the table in terms of the uniqueness of its concept. Moviewatcher.io Moviewatcher.io is another fantastic site for free movie downloads online. Utilising external links to films, it runs on a very quick server and thus load times are kept to the minimum… Whilst the ability to manually select links would be useful, the automated, review-based selection does seem to return good results in most instances. So, with that said, the only real bug bear is the site’s use of ads, but hey, it’s rare to find a site that doesn’t these days!. Movienight.ws Movienight.ws will tempt you with an enormous collection of films, documentaries and series in HD quality. Ads. That’s the main problem with the site. However, it’s still an amazing site for movie and TV fans. We think that the site needs to up its’ game in terms of putting up the latest movies for its’ users if it wants to compete with its’ high performing competitors. But, as the files are all hosted on the site’s own servers, video streams are very fast, so you won’t regret making this site your destination to watch free movies online. Movieplus.pro Movieplus.cc is a long standing site, and this is most apparent in its’ very dated appearance and UI, and this has certainly affected the site’s visitor figures. What this site does offer is its own character, a uniqueness that makes it stand out from other free movie websites, and despite appearances to the contrary, the site offers the latest movies too via external links. So, even though it has an old fashioned look for a free movie website,  it still functions well as a great site to watch free movies online. UPDATE: No longer streams movies, even via external links. Now it functions solely as a search engine for movies. Allmovie.com  Next up is Allmovie.com. Whilst this place is a good enough candidate for your attention, it could do with some major improvement. The database is out of date and the site doesn’t appear to be updated with anything coming close to regularity, so don’t expect to find the latest films here. With that being said, the site does have its own movie review blog which you are welcome to contribute to. Despite the use of ads, the loading times of the site are good. Allmovie.com has an Alexa rank of 79, 000, but this will drop unless the site starts to update its’ database and makes more effort to remain current.

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. We director Paul calls just a second gonna head to the AT&T hotline right now though a check without first guest tonight former patriot defensive back. At Super Bowl we're at rolled pulled joins a WEEI the pride. A Fort Valley State LaGrange Georgia a good evening Tyrone Power usurped. They gave the thank you ahead of me off. It seems like yesterday you and tied in Eugene and ride the of that defensive back row ironically of course deadly end. In Houston of lowers real life real than that switch and switch corporate dazed by it doesn't seem like that long ago. I you know work it and did it doesn't. It involved you'd seen in the get calendar need to get out seventeenth 2003. But when you actually. Probably. I guess get internal clock. He gains. And you hear the advertising on television it seems like you're yesterday. What made that team so special your mind. I agree I think we basically. Must step companies and 2003. I got you know people it was the first time that I ever was a part of the team debt you have to pick it can't. Prior to the game. And get the aura of family. Every one depended on each other and he'll be an individual. If everybody did do when their job. Will be okay and get a loan problem go before it became a real slogan. The years past I just a few years ago put. I'd get the family get that it could be KO and yet how he put his players in position to make plea. I get offended what I hear these people I've been bitching about for the last two hours about these lazy reporters who just throughout the word the system the phrase the system. They don't to a Freddie of a team they to a for the patriots now let me ask you. Exactly what is at because I think there's no system it's a fact of being professional and actually learning the playbook. Doing your job and the ability to adjust on the fly whether it's series to series or game to game. Whatever is what this bill when people brought the word the phrase that's system regard to patriots does that bother you. Note that no it doesn't and eighty tap it once they detonated at a slow be you can't use when someone else is about system. Okay so there is also the that would have the patriots have actually accomplished they've accomplished multiple Super Bowl any cab you win it. People ought to try to space company but the next time someone says the system you get at about corporate America OP take Microsoft. Ab yeah BK home people take Coca-Cola. Okay they have a system. I'm pretty sure they do. They go about. Isn't that Professional League yet they do they hire the right employees go to one of the company's parent yes they do. The patriots do the same thing. They are eight. What can I have heard the company date if they could be traded or these. New York Stock Exchange people within it there in the New England patrons let. I mean like I think you have those who don't outside and they want to we yet. So they're not winners so they have to pick somebody who knows the biggest bear on the block so to speak to talk about. That them. Are there. It doesn't make me any different I don't know what people say it can't no in this world you have to have a system in order to win. If you wanna if you are good looks. Ed you wanna payable to buy out you have to have a system in which you. Bringing to the table that people watching you to be able to go to traders are no different than any other for Japan cup. But isn't it more about I agree through through that point it's more about you know a mindset here. As opposed to. It owed some of these big corporations yes the ever system and they're the good ones will be able through. Adjust and adapt to things are going well whether B marketing or. Or product what whatever it is what I want but what gets me ties that. Is is that of the phrase the system is never thrown out there are people on the SP and and a phone network. Regarding any of the team. You don't hear it we don't with the Packers like pride Aaron Rodgers put. Two weeks and he's a great quarterback don't get me wrong what about OK so whether the green based system last week as opposed the previous two weeks I mean happened. The system. It's exactly Iraqis see it this group of people. I get to where you're trying to say is people they'd pray they say oh he say. Now that diet constitute definitions packet that bad knee didn't. Are prepared mean terrible and so I'm Luke is an athlete a good. I think that was the bid the patriot half that nobody else could duplicate. And regardless if you player who will be Green Bay Packers if they're trapped about twenty yard line all the way to the opponent end zone. There had to be a bit of a play you have to be called. And just so happened that it patriots day start from the top with Robert Kraft. A corporate media deal Belichick realizes that hey it got knows what he's too so I am going to lay back and let him out. Do where coaches do Oedipus does. You have some owners desperate Soviet I want my hair if they're either go at all so the worst hit it really doesn't bother you at all. It in a debate is about. Food and gas pump about football. That we got out there on the football field. At what the draft. Pick again there are 12 dead make you Alter the decent at. Do what you try to do which school like your Super Bowls and desolate pages had done and I think that got hit bottom line eight you ought when he compared. You don't use sable are pretty sure people are beginning when he first automated people were like oh yes use same boat. Aaron began to dominate okay he must be taken property to look so bad. Putt at his peak. They don't love you they don't hate you so it being here say we go out and got slapped a little but Akers badly. They are badly no matter where you see him outside is that we believe what inside that locker. There was Bieber Tyrone Poole former defensive back thirteen your priority or felt a couple of Super Bowls and when the patriots you have some bars would look injury lies and fortunately but still we'll always remember your your router Tyrell pull that. Great defense about a great defense you know not just that the bat the defensive back through with you when Ty Law. And and Eugene Rodney but Mike Vrabel Roman Phifer Tedy Bruschi mcginnis he might mean god that would tell me. How does this current patriot team this year compare. What do you like about it and the same characteristics. Compare contrast former your Super Bowl winning team at that one in Houston in this one. Well I think our. Talk about outback Ian the second beer back to the year we won it in all read the play a lot of me hit me. And a picture win in the innocent might re able it get a bruise he built. Listen. Desolate lot better wanna do. And I think the second period that we can't live Rodney. You know be in the enforcer and Eugene. Do you expect there. Do what is being free safety I think. In my mind. That we probably at my best secondaries no Corey. It can't be. Being in New England but he's gotten here yet get this right here. Personal. An update at the Betty Ford these. Patriot secondary get personally they can cover. They may not be at the upper hand chancellor that these gat. I hitters ugly tackle whale any corporate update did they blood. You can cover. On the corners it is stay the as far as the alternate the of course you have Tom variants. You know get when people ask me about him basically what makes him so you. What I got here and 03. Tom came up to in the a couple of cannot look at a lot of particulates are exactly. The million he baton. What is at work. Now it got companies with deep this work out normally you know. It'll feel that all this have the heir apparent to live up and did it because it has yet that will comma -- mean and they are. Sometimes would be so that's how he plays and football he plays would have been if it mentality but he's playing ball itself. But there are a lot of similarities and W gasket T he traditional player at each other and issue when making. All season long or at least most the second half you're hearing from a national idiots. That there on the page it's ever played in only quarterback OK statistically true or right they had Russell Wilson who beat them. Obviously your Foxboro they had Palmer the first game of the season which they beat him. Some people forget about Joseph Flacco I guess is on the lead quarterback anymore some people's minds as the patriots. You know beat him through with the number one defense that they had at the time. But would this that would that's sticking your craw. You know at least relegated to the Steelers I mean but all season long. Page Tuesday president wants scoring defense in the league but they haven't played anybody as a deep back if you were on this team right now. Would that bother you or simply be typical pitcher to block out the noise. I didn't block got the noise everything at the distraction they're bigger distraction that he choppy day. The to complete legal went out there week in and week out and they are good. And regardless whether it well they go back to a bad place you know. If Cindy Lee Jack they would be giving it up failed they would not an gag especially if you star that they get separate rate. I guess in most general public. Opinion is it not if you iPad numbers that you are in the gap where you could take eight. Greta quarterback UK Robert richter. And yes he throws a fact that's how the heart yet he now is an elite quarterback. But he's always good quarterback because he'd have to deal so I think sometimes they get. Should be based company numbers each week sixteen weeks. Seeking gains they actually are playing and eat quarterbacks so director determines what the public considers the leaked. But it all this is it deep it is it also I could go back into account but the ability to plant. I go back to when he was with the the Dutch I. It decrypt coordinator. And you got keep up a look at a lot of it up they'll get it started. And update show segment where they would cut by the Dutch idea we intend to bookmobile. That he'll talk about Eugene. Op approach to regain. He wants to mitigate in any type of fashion debt they have dude pages app do well I remembered got being interviewed and the Buick dot. Because a lot and not allow a 100 yard rush all game. They can't be okay in the unit told them. You know what gas. In order to win a Super Bowl because of the uploading it take one or two and he fears. What basic deal sold out in order put communicable. We will have to allow permit comment to brought over a hundred yards and O'Donnell lack adequate. And most importantly I can't talk about C four we have to sacrifice our individual there's some politically. And in order predictable outcome not so you go at all. But yet the right okay that's a box of salt soaks he does a group of trying to say he would heed of a great job he's been doing it every two years and industrial. Compared to the players to go out. And do that did include positions and so it it doesn't matter where he'd say you know the patriots have a great organization a great coach great place. Are you come out of Fort Valley State which more people around a win win before you got a private went where the hell is that. I mean you know you're a first round pick I think what 22 row overall. I read an absolutely an amazing story and are you worth what Carolina Indian Denver before he came to the patriots said. Had good seasons a lot of a lot of good seasons but won a Super Bowl here but. It I'll ask you a guy like Malcolm but we're you gonna have a soft Spartan in your heart for him a guy coming out of west Alabama nobody knew. Anything's a bottom on Shura much like yourself coming out of Fort Valley State so is that a fair analogy. Yeah you know all the small school. The only difference between in. Your state or a university Georgia island university takes it out. Exposure. And I thank god that they had seen your gold had to come back so I feel bad. You know it's all about we've come out how this all about. Going to college in started you'll freshman year that we you wanna start unit bleached the call. How does this fluid say it if you make him play. They're going back I'm like it was way back in the day so. Gagged now let Malcolm they'd give an opportunity to get going to be other. Up from what was gonna go to follow him at this question is gonna be proposed to him out so yes he may amount and all other small. College quarters. Bad not that prototypical six. 1626. Whatever the gas we shall get a week alone we can place of my hat goes off to Malcolm and I'm pretty sure. His rookie year he probably spent a lot of time and he'll be a boom. That's why he's playing in great ball equally. It was speak with Tyrone Poole former patriots are quarterback to Super Bowl winner thirteen year veteran Indiana felt at the last. Couple questions several thank you particularly humorous personally boredom my dad's birthday my dad passed but I February 3 so you have a soft spot in my heart for for that but. But what you're living in that you grew up by talk of Fannie living in in Georgia LaGrange Georgia. Yes born and raised in the graduate. Here in Atlanta so. I grew up. Originally a falcons in Dallas cowboy sane man wildly back to William and truly into account saying yup you're black cal he's I even went Jerry grant field let the what data your packet Atlanta so. I'll let my employer as. Got it to the pros McCain believe it paid oak a kind of toward you know like watching you aren't sure report. Alabama the other side plays Auburn I can you reclaim what developers like what do you do well that Turkey deal. Cox. Let you know I I feel like. The actual wisdom and the game itself. Experience I had to go to the patriots again just yeah well you know goes to Atlanta so. Great idea to de epic intangibles culture and it turnovers are going to determine. Is gonna win Super Bowl. What's the mood down there right now and and they let it area because I've heard some talk show host who were absolutely delusional that they're spewing the same stuff about. Take a practices stuff they don't understand spy gate they don't novice and ought to Google whatever it is that need to. Look up the facts and just throw this stuff out there the patriots cheat and this status like lazy real lazy journalism but do you sense that there is there an overconfidence down there amongst. Falcon fans or just the area itself I mean I know they're happy to be either but we all know. And you Tyrod he can't deny this I mean the Atlanta Detroit Atlanta sports brand. Is not taken very seriously. Present company excluded of course but by the rest of the countries that fair. Well I think there is that assessment debt people based off of Egypt continuous continuous support. There have been years where the falcons and that done whales and that they have support. And travel supporters Lawrence with a Spain. I have not been as hot lightly lived you know I remember that remember my days airlock games played against Miami Dolphins. It was small. And W tech game at hand at the one thing to do about that you remember if they had been played on his aunt with Otis and Olympia area. You know it is cold out there in the air if steel sold out. Sometimes you don't see that falcons at the time they were not doing whale. You know that this support was that yes so from debt they have what athletes you know people look at it split and say did you go to Spain and yes they got the area. Sporting. Territory Brett I do believe that they are beginning to have copied who created something new here and yet. To be trop the only three yen debt. Aura that system actually want.

By SueChang Markets reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Friday after a monumental week that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 20,000 for the first time as investors weighed disappointing fourth-quarter data on domestic economic growth and a spate of earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% fell 7.13 points to end at 20,093.78, after rising on Thursday to close above the 20,000 level for a second straight day. The blue-chip index rose 1.3% for the week. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.09%  shed 1.99 points to finish at 2,294.69, for a weekly gain of 1%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.10% bucked the trend to edge up 5.61 points, or 0.1%, to close at 5,660.78, up 1.9% during the week. Analysts said investors have retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they look for more details on Trump administration’s policies and corporations. “Stocks have been trading sideways since mid-December after a rally after the elections. While favorable earnings and still-favorable economic data underpin most recent gains, markets would still like more clarity on fiscal policies and more clarity from corporations on how they see it would impact them,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve, U.S. Bank. On the economic front, a reading of U.S. gross domestic product showed that economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter and annual growth failed to reach 3% for the 11th straight year. Meanwhile, durable-goods orders also fell in December for the second month in a row. Those lackluster results may have given little cause for enthusiasm among perspective equity buyers. U.K.'s Theresa May meets Trump to talk trade(1:40) U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday will become the first foreign leader to meet Donald Trump since he took office. In a tricky balancing act, she has to lay the ground for a trade deal with the U.S. and avoid antagonizing European leaders. Photo: Reuters “U.S. GDP and durable goods misses dampened some of the enthusiasm we saw earlier in the week. Markets appear to be more interested in digesting recent action than starting anything new with a number of potentially big developments next week,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Major events next week include the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting and earnings from Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.01% and Facebook Inc. FB, -0.45% Trump met with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May during which the two leaders discussed a new bilateral trade deal as the U.K. prepares to leave the European Union. The summit comes as Trump has pushed an “America first” policy of protectionism and decried multilateral trade deals, while May has promoted her vision of Britain as the biggest proponent of free trade. May also stressed that any trade agreement with the U.S. would put British interests first.

Patent applications focus on eye conditions Rony Abovitz founded Magic Leap, a mixed reality technology company in Plantation. Miami Herald File i By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The mysterious Magic Leap’s recent patent applications describe a wearable device that uses augmented reality to treat color blindness, macular degeneration and other eye conditions. The South Florida technology company’s most recent patent application describes “an augmented reality head-mounted ophthalmic system comprising a wearable augmented reality display platform” that would be “configured to pass said light from the world into an eye of a wearer” and says the “wearable augmented reality device is configured to selectively modify said light from the world based on a color detection deficiency of the wearer,” the Sun Sentinel reported. The device inventors, according to the application: Rony Abovitz, founder and CEO of Magic Leap; Brian Schowengerdt, co-founder and chief science and experience officer; Nicole Elizabeth Samec, a biomedical engineer; John Graham Macnamara, senior creative scientist; Mark Baerenrodt, healthcare business leader; and Christopher M. Harrises of Nashua, N.H. The application concerning color blindness, which afflicts 5 to 10 percent of the world population, is the latest in a series of patent filings concerning the eyes. The company, with a campus in Plantation and offices in Dania Beach, has filed more than 200 patent applications in diverse industries since it began operation in 2011. These are not the first patent filings that have suggested healthcare uses; early applications suggested uses as diverse as heart surgery or patient recovery, suggesting the technology could impact areas as diverse as gaming, tourism, retail and education. The secretive Magic Leap has raised nearly $1.4 billion from Google, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and other investors, more than any other company in South Florida, and has recently committed to creating 725 jobs in Broward County. The company has not released details of its first product or when it will be launched, but in recent months it has faced a flurry of negative tech press suggesting that the company is having difficulties. Magic Leap has described its technology as “a new mixed reality computing platform that will enable people to interact with the world in ways never before possible.” Abovitz has said Magic Leap’s technology could have many uses beyond entertainment, including in the healthcare field. University of Miami alumus Abovitz co-founded Mako Surgical in Broward County.

We saw several products during the recent CES 2017 technology trade show in Las Vegas that not only speed up the connection between wireless devices and the internet, but fill those annoying dead spaces that, until now, wireless network coverage just couldn’t reach. That means customers will start hearing a lot about “WiGig” and “mesh networking” from here on out. First up is the speed increase provided by the new “WiGig” wireless technology, which is also known as Wireless AD. This specification was first developed and promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) trade association, hence the “WiGig” nickname associated with Wireless AD devices. The specification was adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at the tail end of 2012, which is responsible for the foundation of all wireless device connectivity. In 2013, the Wireless Gigabit Alliance became a part of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which is the nonprofit international association that certifies wireless devices based on technology produced through the IEEE. The Wi-Fi Alliance is the group responsible for slapping the “Wi-Fi Certified” labels on wireless devices and networking products, to assure customers that its wireless capability was tested and approved. It’s okay to play catch up Now fast-forward to October of 2016. Many wireless devices sold on the market now such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, are based on Wireless AC technology, which is slower than the just-launched Wireless AD, but faster than the old Wireless N tech. That’s a lot of letters we know, and the new Wireless AD standard is welcomed with open arms, but it’s arrival is also a bit aggravating. Those who are just now enjoying a Wireless AC network need not worry about gadgets becoming obsolete. Why? Because Wireless AC’s availability on the general market is just beginning to feel “normal.” The  technology is just now becoming a standard feature in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and whatnot. But that’s just how technology goes. Once customers get the latest product, it’s obsolete. The Wi-Fi Alliance warned in late 2016 that 2017 would be the year Wireless AD devices arrived, and it wasn’t kidding. Wireless AD’s headline feature is its third connectivity option: 60GHz. It joins the existing 5GHz and 2.4GHz choices that are already available on Wireless AC and Wireless N devices, and is capable of up to 8,000 megabits (or eight gigabits) per second. Network products supporting this 60GHz connection will use what is called beamforming technology to send direct signals to connected devices up to 33 feet away from the access point. This 60GHz band enables things not previously possible, like wireless virtual reality. Wireless AD is just a baby, and all this speed is mostly overkill anyway You’ll see networking solutions sold as “tri-band” throughout the year. But don’t let manufacturers fool you: tri-band doesn’t necessarily mean Wireless AD. There are routers and mesh-based networking solutions that add a second 5GHz band instead of the new 60GHz band. This makes them tri-band, but not compatible with the new Wireless AD standard. As of this publication, there aren’t many Wireless AD routers on the market to support Wireless AD-capable laptops. We covered Netgear’s Nighthawk X10 in October, and a scan on Newegg produced only one other result: the TP-Link Talon AD7200 router. Wireless AD, it seems, is still in its infancy. But 2017 is young, and this year serves as the launch pad for Wireless AD products. But there’s something else to keep in mind about all the speedy numbers surrounding Wireless AD. It’s mostly overkill… at least, for now. A wireless connection at 8,000 megabits per second is usually bottlenecked by your internet connection (most range from 10 to 1,000Mbps). If your internet connection provides a maximum download speed of up to 30 megabits per second, that’s all you get. Wireless AD is fast, but it won’t magically increase the speed of the ISP’s internet service. Mesh networking is ready to make your Wi-Fi easier But that’s enough about speed. As we said, mesh networking was a highlight at the CES 2017 trade show too. While speed is important, mesh-based networks primarily focus on wireless coverage throughout the home or office. Products based on this technology began to appear in 2016 followed by the debut of new solutions during the Las Vegas show. But, just like Wireless AD, mesh networking aims to transform the home or office network from here on out. In mesh networking the router, and its companion nodes, appear as one connection. Devices don’t connect to one specific node in a list of available access points. Instead, the hub and nodes combine into one access point. These mesh-based solutions typically choose the best available band automatically, instead of splitting them into separate, visible bands, which you must then choose between on your devices. Mesh networking can fix dead spots that befuddle traditional routers. Why is this better than the standard router? Just imagine one small device broadcasting its signals in every direction. Of course, the more antennas it has, the better the reach and number of simultaneously connected devices. But range has its limits, hence the market for range extenders and routers capable of linking with other routers. And the original signal degrades as it travels away from the central router, even if a range extender is installed. Ultimately, getting full wireless coverage in a home or office can get expensive with traditional hardware, and may even demand wired connections between routers and extenders. With mesh-based solutions, additional nodes can be purchased and easily added without the need for extra wires and bulky devices that merely “echo” the originating signals. Mesh-based networking is great for multi-floor homes and buildings, too. CES 2017 lacked mesh-based networking products supporting the new Wireless AD standard. That may have something to do with mesh networking technology’s recent arrival. But unlike Wireless AD networking solutions, there are quite a few mesh-based systems currently on the market. AmpliFi HD Eero Google WiFi Three-pack: $349 $499 $299 Two-pack: n/a $349 n/a Single unit: $129 $199 $129 Luma Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi Three-pack: $299 $499 n/a Two-pack: $249 $349 $399 Single unit: $149 $199 $249 Two mesh-based systems not in the charts above are the just-announced Asus HiveSpot and Asus HiveDot, the latter of which doesn’t sport a dedicated 5GHz connection installed specifically for node-to-node communication. The company has these systems listed as “coming soon,” and hasn’t revealed pricing. Also not included in the chart is the Securifi Almond 3, which doesn’t come in a kit and costs $149 per single unit. Almond 3 units can be added to the current wireless network as nodes just like all other mesh-based networking products. The downside to mesh networking? Well, as the charts show, mesh-based systems aren’t exactly cheap, ranging from $299 to $499 for starter kits containing three units. A lot of users are going to question if the benefit is worth the cost. Hit turbo on your home network It’s possible none of these advancements will peak your interest. If you live in a smaller home, or one that lacks internal walls with pesky obstructions (like plumbing), you may be well served by existing routers. For many, though, these advancements will fix issues current routers don’t address. Even the most powerful standard routers have trouble with plumbing, appliances, and other obstructions that cause dead spots. And some struggle to stream 4K video over Wi-Fi, due to limited bandwidth. Both problems should be fixed by the end of 2017 – if you can lay down the cash for a cutting-edge router. Also watch: Share

I'm very excited about all the new activists that Trump has inspired. I love looking at the photos, hearing their stories and knowing about the in-person connections made. I look forward to hearing and reading about their successes on social media. I want to help these new activists by connecting them with experienced activists and experts I know who kick ass. We can learn from them. I always want to know, "What was done in the past that worked? What has to be done to make it work now? How do we go about doing that in our current environment? My friend Cliff Schecter is starting a new podcast called An Unpresidented Podcast, Bigly  and it has a GoFund me link here that will be addressing some of these issues, especially as it concerns the media. "Many of us have lamented the lack of progressive media infrastructure. I've given my all to combating this by founding (and partially funding) an independent, progressive radio station in Washington DC and going on independent radio and tv. With the election of Donald Trump, I feel I must do more. So I'm starting this podcast to take our message to an even wider audience." During the Bush years Cliff was one of the people who got on the MSM and kicked GOP's spokespersons' asses. It is great fun to watch him do this here.  I would love to see more examples of that, not only with GOP shills but with our lame media. Remember what fun it was to watch Lauren Duca  knock the smirk off  Tucker Carlson's face? Cliff has been on the Majority Report with Sam Seder on Friday for years and he has helped me to make sense of the what and why that's happening in political world. I also am interested in the who and the how. Cliff and I have mutual friends that we advise in the fight to reduce gun violence. Our friends at Nebraskans Against Gun Violence just had a success today in their continued vocal, actions against a pro-guns everywhere Republican Senator Bill Kintner. Today he announced his resignation. "Nebraska lawmaker quits after tweet about Women's March protesters sparks outrage" ↓ Story continues below ↓ We have another mutual connection, some guy in a show that also has Star in the title, Mark Hamill.  Hamill got to know Cliff after learning about his work reducing gun violence.  He then invited Cliff and his boys to the set of an upcoming Star Wars movie. (I'm not jealous or anything because I'm a Vulcan.) So you got your Hollywood Celebrity acknowledging Cliff's work against evil.  Sweet. Cliff was even able to get some stuff signed by Hamill for early donors for the podcast. Hamill even made some of his great voice work available (love him on The Flash!). Now Cliff might get some more --either in a contest or a super big donation --It depends on the demand. Personally I don't care for any Star thing with "Wars" in the title, but that's me.  My understanding from listening to Chris Hardwick @hardwick talk to Hamill on the Nerdist is that people like Hamill actually enjoy collect Star-things. Hmm. Humans.) I love new people getting involved in activism, but one of my frustrations is watching the "neutral" MSM and experts dismiss movement successes along the way. I want to help people learn how to counter it.  The good news is that social media is kicking the media's ass in multiple ways: distribution, engagement and speed. But the MSM TV media still exists and is very important to people in power.  As insightful media writer Matt Zoller Seitz said in The Vulture TV Podcast "A television monster inhabits the White House and he continues to be financially entangled with the medium that gave birth to his Presidential candidacy." "He [Trump] is Television. "  @mattzollerseitz On Donald Trump Seitz uses a quote from Trump's speech to the CIA. "I get up this morning and I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I say, 'wait a minute I made a speech. The field was, it looked like a million, a million and a half people."  It's important to note he didn't say which one. He talks about what he saw  and how it didn't jibe with his view of the world.   Trump wants MSM TV news to reflect back to him his reality.  He craves it. When the media don't give him what he wants he can either revise his reality (HA!), or demand the people giving the information change.  One thing we can learn from this is that if you know what media your audience cares about, and consumes, you can focus on them. We need to be better at getting our people on the TV with solid messages.  We still have a mewling "both sides do it" press. Waiting for the MSM journalists to stand up to him is going to take time. I've written before about how understanding the MSM process helps get your message across. Over the years I've taught 100's of very powerful and now famous people to talk to the media and to very specific audiences. I start by asking them "What do you actually, read, watch and listen to?" (vs what they think they are supposed to)  The answers have changed over the years from "The Journal, the local newspapers and the "trade rags." to "My Twitter feed." I then ask them to name actual publications or people that they look at vs. "all of them" This information is critical to know if you want to know how to reach them where they actual engage. What people need to understand is that powerful people are much more excited to see their name mentioned favorably in the media they and their peers watch, read or respect. They will say, "I want to be in the Journal, above the fold" ( For you young people, being in the top half of a folded paper was like being in the 10 ten search results on Google.) This is why Trump dismisses Fox News as a slam dunk, it's not a challenge. Media venues that are seen as a "slam dunk" are taken for granted. (Note to progressive activists, you actually have a better chance doing well in a venue like Fox than on MSNBC.) One thing that people don't understand is how the MSM news and cable shows use surrogates to help them say what they feel they can't. So, for example, producers showing their intent by using weak experts on a topic. That is why you didn't see articulate, combative peace experts on the Sunday morning talk shows in the run up to the war. When they want to seem "fair and balanced" networks go to celebrities as experts to address an issue so they can later dismiss them. This is why Janeane Garofolo was on TV talking against the war in 2003. The right understands this. That is why they created categories of "experts" from "think tanks" like the Heritage Foundation. Did you know that there are have 12 full time PR people pushing their views? They have a high end studio for guests and provide ongoing media training for their staff, book authors and experts. It has had a huge pay off. The Heritage Foundation people are now calling the shots in thousands of positions in the government. And when the right doesn't have a single "celebrity" on their side they dismiss "celebrity" as non-important. Sometimes you see someone from the left do a really great talking to the media and you say, "Why can't we have more of her on TV!"  It's a good question. Because the odds are that if we loved her she won't be asked back.  There are a number of reasons this happens, and it can be explained and addressed. We can't change the journalists quickly, but we can change their guests.  To get "more of that" on TV we have to constantly be training and preparing people who are in position to speak. These are just some of the issues I talked to Cliff about and he said he will cover on the podcast. I'm looking forward to hearing it. In my century we don't have the same need for money yours does. We also didn't have nation states and billionaires funding the Klingons, Romulans and Providers.  I don't want to be a thrall. So I'm putting my Quatloos on the people who are going to fight and the ones who have shown us how to effectively fight in the past.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel US stocks edged lower for a second consecutive session on Friday as some underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data offset recent enthusiasm over policy actions by President Donald Trump. US economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.4 percent to USD 113.79 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The S&P energy index , down 0.9 percent, was the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors. Starbucks curbed gains on the Nasdaq. Its shares dropped 4.0 percent to USD 56.12 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "The market has rallied on expectations of good things to happen in the future but as we are getting the data that is factual of what is going on, it is not as good as people are hoping," said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago. "Which tells you, this earnings recovery that is expected in 2017, a good chunk of it is already baked into the market." Even with some disappointing corporate results, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to show growth of 6.8 percent, which would mark the biggest increase in two years and second straight quarter of growth, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow remained above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. For the week, the Dow rose 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,093.78, the S&P 500 lost 1.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,294.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,660.78. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to USD 65.78, while Intel gained 1.1 percent to USD37.98 after both reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet lost 1.4 percent to USD8 45.03 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive slumped 5.2 percent to USD 64.68 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 26 new lows. About 5.81 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, compared with the 6.56 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Montana was in his third season with the San Francisco 49ers when they faced the Cincinnati Bengals in the Pontiac Silverdome. The 60-year-old Hall of Fame quarterback knows the disadvantage players making their first start face in the big game. Atlanta's Matt Ryan will do that against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots on Feb. 5 in Houston. "That's where the game is a little different. Once you get down to the Super Bowl city, and you're going for the first time, it's nuts," Montana said in an interview with The Associated Press. "Everybody that you ever knew in your life comes out of the woodwork looking for something." VIDEOS TOP JOBS Montana was 14 for 22 for 157 yards and a touchdown in the 49ers' 26-21 win in 1982. "Once you get out of the bus or however you get to the stadium that day, and you get into the locker room, it's just like another game. "And yes, it's a little bit more exciting till the game starts. Once the game starts, and you're still thinking 'Wow this is the Super Bowl,' you're in trouble." Montana never had trouble in the Super Bowl, going 4-0 with 11 touchdown passes and no interceptions. Going into this Super Bowl, Montana is launching a new virtual reality video game, "Montana 17." It's an all-passing, 7-on-7 offensive football game with a series of quick-play quarters. "I don't think a lot of people knew about 7 on 7, what 7 on 7 really meant, but now all the younger kids have 7 on 7 with passing leagues, whether it's high school or even younger than that," Montana said. "We started off trying to do a regular game. Obviously EA (Electronic Arts) is pretty big in that space. We're looking for spaces to go. This kind of evolved into here. "With the VR (virtual reality) space coming around and the ability to do in it there and be one of the first movers in there, we thought it was a great opportunity. And especially on the passing side, it just makes it a lot more fun." The game is set to launch soon and will initially be available on Samsung Gear VR and then on Google Daydream VR. Gamers will slide their phones into a headset. And the game has a license from the NFL Players Association to use the likenesses of all current NFL players. Montana has previous experience with video games, having endorsed games for Sega in the 1990s. "I've always had an interest in it," he said. "I don't play at as much because my kids were too good and beat the crap out of me, and I can't stand losing." One of the investors in the game is Patriots owner Robert Kraft. And Kraft's team is trying to win its fifth Super Bowl, one more than Montana had with the 49ers. "It's great to have him (Kraft) involved." Montana said. One thing Kraft's Patriots and Montana's 49ers had in common was being able to sustain dominance over a long period of time. "It's too many people moving around, it's really difficult," Montana said of the challenge of keeping winning teams together. "It's been amazing what they've been able to do as an organization to keep that team together, at least a nucleus of guys. And really understand which guys are interchangeable with other players of similar qualities. And that's what allows you to be able to stay on top. » Next page...
