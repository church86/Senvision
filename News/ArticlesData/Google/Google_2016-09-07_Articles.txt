Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library: For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Build settings To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Environment variables Disable content process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable NPAPI process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Allow weaker than default sandbox level MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Enable sandbox logging MOZ_WIN_SANDBOX_LOGGING Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release. sbwc2 Roll out level 2 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

Quality and relevance are different things, yet we often discuss them as if they were the same. SEOs have been optimizing for relevance all this time, but are now being asked to optimize for quality. This post will discuss what that means and how to do it, with a focus on what I believe to be the single most effective and scaleable tactic for improving your site's overall level of quality in most situations. You need BOTH quality AND relevance to compete these days. First, let's establish what we're talking about here, which is quality. You can have relevancy (the right topic and keywords) without quality, as shown here: This MFA site is highly relevant for the phrase "Chairs for Baby." But it also sucks. "...babies are sensitive, delicate individuals who need cautious. So choosing a right Chairs For Baby is your gentle care." WTF? It doesn’t matter how relevant the page is. The only way to get that page to rank these days would be to buy a lot of links, but then you're dealing with the added risk. After a certain point, it’s just EASIER to build a better site. Yes, Google has won that battle in all but the most hyper-competitive niches, where seasoned experts still find the reward:risk ratio in their favor. OK, now that we've established that quality and relevance are different things, but that you need both to rank, how do you optimize for quality? Quality Indicators Tactics (How to Optimize for Quality) Grammar, spelling, depth Hire a copy editor. Learn to write better. Expertise, Authority, Trust (EAT) Make content deep and useful. Call out your awards, certifications, news coverage, and use trust symbols. Make it easy to contact you, and easy to find policies like terms of service, returns, and privacy. PageRank (PR) from links Build high-quality links. There are thousands of great articles out there about it. Reviews Ask your best clients/customers. Short-clicks Improve Out-of-Stock pages with in-stock alerts and related products. Be less aggressive with your pop-up strategy. Also see query refinements, pages per visit, and dwell time. Query refinements Only attract the "right" audience and deliver what you promised in the search results. Choose keywords by relevance, not just volume. Think about query intent. Dwell time on site Make your pages stickier by improving the overall design. Add images and video. Run GA reports on the stickiest traffic sources and develop a strategy to increase traffic from those sources. Pages per visit Improve internal linking, suggest related content, customize 404 pages. Split up long posts into a series. Conversion rates Do A/B testing, make your messaging very clear, follow CRO best practices. Ad placements No ads above the main content on the page and do not have an annoying amount of ad blocks or pop-ups. CTR from SERPs Craft better title tags, URLs, and descriptions. Grab attention. Gain trust. Make them want to click. Add schema markup when appropriate. Page speed Visit https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/. Mobile experience Responsive and/or adaptive design, less text, easy navigation, loads lighting fast, shorter forms. There are many ways to improve the quality of your site. Some are obvious. Others are more abstract. All of these quality indicators together make up your site's overall level of quality. For more, check out the keyword agnostic ranking factors and the engagement metrics from SimilarWeb areas in the Moz Search Engine Ranking Factors report. We've already established that Google knows the relative quality of a page. Let's assume — because it is very likely — that Google also knows the relative quality of your entire site. And let's call that your sitewide QualityRank (QR) (h/t Ian Lurie, 2011). What's the most effective, scalable, proven tactic for improving a website's QR? In a word: Pruning. Learn more about it here. Pruning requires doing a content audit first, which you can learn more about here. It's nothing groundbreaking or new, but few clients come in the door that can't substantially benefit from this process. Sometimes pruning is as easy as applying a noindex tag to all pages that have had zero organic search traffic over the course of a year. You may be surprised how many enterprise-level sites have huge chunks of the site that fit that criteria. Other times it requires more analysis and tougher decisions. It really all depends on the site. So let's look at some pruning case studies. Three things to remember: 1. Significant portions of the sites were removed from Google's index. 2. Pruning was not the only thing that was done. Rarely do these things happen in a vacuum, but evidence points to pruning as a major contributor to the growth examples you're about to see. 3. You can read more about Inflow's research in our case studies section. 1800doorbell had technical issues that made it possible to identify cruft and prune big chunks of the site quickly. This contributed to a 96% increase in revenue from organic search within six months. The dip at the end has to do with how the timeline was generated in GA. Growth was sustained. We're not the only ones finding success with this. Go check out the Ahrefs case study for another example. Here's a compelling image from their case study: Ahrefs saw amazing results after performing a content audit and pruning their blog. If you weren't already convinced, I hope by now it's clear that performing a content audit to determine which pages should be improved and which should be pruned from Google's index is an effective and scalable SEO tactic. That being established, let's talk about why this might be. We don't know exactly how Google's ranking algorithms work. But it seems likely that there is a score for a site's overall level of quality. Does QualityRank actually exist as a calculation in Google's organic algorithm? Probably not under that name and not in this simplistic form. But it DOES seem likely that something similar would exist, especially since it exists for PPC. The problem I have with the PPC equivalent is that it includes relevance factors like keyword use in their metric for "quality." Google needs a way to measure the overall quality level of each site in order to rank them properly. It's just probably much more mathematically complicated than what we're talking about here. The point of discussing QualityRank as a framework for pruning is to help explain why pruning works. And to do that, we don't need to understand the complex formulas behind Google’s ranking algorithms. I doubt half of the engineers there know what's going on these days, anyway. Let’s imagine a site divided into thirds, with each third being assigned a QualityRank (QR) score based on the average QR of the pages within that section. The triangle below represents all indexable content on a domain with a QR of 30. That sitewide QR score of 30 comes from adding all three of these sections together and dividing by three. In the real world, this would not be so simple. I hope the mathematicians out there will grant me some leeway for the sake of illustrating the concept. This is the same site after removing the bottom 50 percent from the index: Notice the instant lift from QR 30 to QR 40 just by removing all LOW QR pages. That is why I say pruning is the most effective way to raise your site’s overall quality level for better rankings, IF you have a lot of low-quality pages indexed, which most sites do. Time to switch analogies Pruning works because it frees up the rest of your content from being weighed down by the cruft. "Cruft" includes everything from a 6-year-old blog post about the company holiday party to 20 different variants with their own landing pages for every product. It also includes pages that are inadvertently indexed for technical reasons, like faceted navigation URLs. Remove the bottom half of this iceberg and the rest of it will "rise up," making more of it visible above the surface (i.e. on the first 2–3 pages of Google). The idea of one page being weighed down by another has been around at least since the first Panda release. I'm not writing about anything new here, as evidenced by the many resources below. But I’m constantly surprised by the amount of dead weight most websites continue to carry around, and hope that this post motivates folks to finally get rid of some of it. Your choices are many: 404, 301, rel ="canonical", noindex, disallow... Some of the resources below will help you decide which solutions to use for your unique situation.

I know that a basic content audit and pruning will help but did not think of it that much with recent clients until now. The iceburg example was what really made that stick. Also the ability to create new content to put on top of the old is not always the best when some of that older content depending on the quality can just be weighing down the good stuff.

Maybe I should make the "cruft" part rock or metal. ;-) Great question. Here are some things to look at: Overall landing page traffic from search Revenue / Purchases of that item Engagement metrics like time on site, bounce rate, etc... Copyscape / Siteliner score indicating duplicate content (thresholds vary by site) Thin content External links There are many others, but generally if the page has no external links, is substantially duplicate or thin, has poor engagement metrics, and little or no revenue or traffic from organic search it is a candidate for removal from the index UNTIL the page gets improved.

You explained Quality Rank (QR) in details here but not so much the "Relevance Rank" (RR). At what point does a low-quality website can outrank a high-quality one due to it's relevancy. For example, will a website with 100% QR / 40% RR rank higher than 60% QR / 80% RR? Another important thing is understanding the value of quality indicators. Obviously backlinks are the top factor for SE, but what would you recommend focusing on? Of course it's cool to have all of the items on the list checked, but can you optimize the process and kick your QR just enough to rank higher if you have a decent RR? 5 1 Reply <p>Thanks for posting.

We've found that the more past events we have, the better the upcoming events rank as they all interlink. Would no indexing the past pages affect this optimisation? 3 0 Reply <p>Great post Everett</p>

<p>We have an events website and at any one time, due to the nature of events 'expiring' the number of old events is always growing  </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Would you recommend adding a no index tag to any past events as they are very seldom searched for but we'd like to leave the content live  </p>

<p>As we include rich metadata perhaps google is intelligent enough to know these events are in the past anyway so we shouldn't risk noindexing 100000s of past eventpages?</p>

<p>We've found that the more past events we have, the better the upcoming events rank as they all interlink. Would  no indexing the past pages affect this optimisation?</p> Submit Cancel Everett Sizemore 2016-09-16T10:07:51-07:00 Automatically NoIndexing them after a certain period of time seems like a logical approach if you need them on the site for visitors, but not for search engines.

I recently started analysing logfiles and for a lot of our sites it was quite a shock to see the frequency with which Googlebot is visiting the pages. On some of our bigger sites, 85% of the pages are crawled less than once a month. Pruning the lower quality pages would certainly increase the crawl frequency on more interesting parts of our site. Working in publishing however it's not easy to convince my colleagues to prune articles. Apart from the content audit you mentioned, checking the log files can also reveal valuable information on "useless" or duplicate pages. On one site we discovered that old urls from previous versions of the site were still returning 200 status. These url's couldn't be found by crawling the site, but Googlebot remembered them & kept on crawling them. Part of them where "empty" pages, the others where duplicates of existing pages. We eliminated these pages (too soon however to see if there is an impact on traffic) 3 0 Reply <p>Nice post as usual Everett. </p>

They're lucky to have you working on their site. With Screaming Frog's recent announcement that they're in the log file analysis game we'll probably see even more SEOs doing the same. Paul mentioned in his comment some other potential reasons pruning could work, other than the QualityRank explanation I gave in the post, which would align with your ideas above about how improving crawl frequency for better pages could help. I still think there is an overall quality score for the site as a whole, based on a variety of on-page, off-page and user-generated metrics, and it would stand to reason that reducing the amount of very low quality pages on the site would benefit the remaining pages in that way. 3 0 Reply <p>Dirk,</p>

The only issue I take with this is that there's too much emphasis placed on the removal of webpages and a direct benefit derived form it, when in reality it's more nuanced. If you're removing pages that are receiving little or no traffic, than you aren't going to see a traffic loss.

Better crawlability is definitely one of the main reasons to prune your site. I'm not sure improving the existing content is the reason though. This is because we've seen this work at scale with just the pruning part, not the improving part. In other words, we removed low quality pages without improving others in some cases and noticed similar effects. I respect your opinion (always have) but we've done this many times now and I strongly believe the main reason for the lifts is due to the removing of excess pages. I could be wrong, but that is what I think. 3 0 Reply <p>Paul,</p>

I'm curious about how much of a factor that is. I'm more concerned with the why than anything else. I suppose that it could be that some sort of engagement factor is actually being considered by Google (I don't want to open a can of worms on that debate) and that poor engaging content is negatively impacting the overall site performance. It could also be that NLP is a larger part of the algorithm than I would have expected and by removing extraneous pages, there's improvements to semantic closeness. Interesting in any case. 4 0 Reply <p>I can be wrong. That's okay :)</p>

<p>Interesting in any case.</p> Submit Cancel Everett Sizemore 2016-09-07T08:39:33-07:00 Do you mean measuring the amount of indexed pages? Yes, and - on sites that need to be pruned - we'll typically see rankings and traffic improve as the amount of indexed pages in GSC goes down. I'm not sure we could isolate all of the variables to reach the level of certainty we'd all like in this industry. We just do what we find works and try to retroactively figure out what's going on in many cases, which is what I've done here. The can of worms I want to open is the one that follows advice from Googlers telling SEOs that Rel= "Canonical" on massive sites is the way to solve the cruft problem, and that a Noindex tag is superfluous. They've actually warned AGAINST pruning, which boggles my mind considering how much money they probably spend crawling, indexing and ranking all the cruft on the open web. Rel "Canonical" to another page doesn't remove a URL from the index, though the page to which it canonicalizes will be the one to show up. You can test this by searching with highly specific queries that surface non-canonical pages, such as these: https://t.co/iHpheuzYoW . Still indexed. Noindex,Follow still allows the pages to be crawled, but log file analysis will probably show you that these pages are now being crawled much less frequently. More importantly, as explained above, they are no longer "indexed" by Google, which seems to have an effect in-and-of itself. Telling Google "This URL is equivalent to this other URL" is not the same as saying "This URL should not be in your index". I also want to make sure it is clear that I'm not talking about pruning "instead of" improving. Improving the page is the better option in most cases. This is a matter of scale and prioritization. As for the effect being due to closer semantics, that is one of the reasons I pointed out the difference between quality and relevancy. You may need to prune highly "relevant" pages in terms of the semantic closeness to your main topics, but I suspect you'll still see the lift by removing relevant, but low-quality, URLs from the index.

For example, it would rank a property portal above a real estate company when someone is searching for "real estate company." Just because the portal is a behemoth containing many real estate companies, this does not make it more relevant, since it is not actually a "real estate company." Google needs to figure this out and apply fairness and relevance to it's results.

That might end up being one of the most dramatic games of the year. It’s gotta be a painful loss for the Panthers who have to feel like the Broncos had no business winning this game. And that’s the second straight game they probably feel that way. It was a great game and if it’s a harbinger for what’s about to come, it’s going to be a highly entertaining NFL season. This will end our live NFL coverage here at the Guardian but stick with us throughout the season for in-depth coverage of the 2016-17 season.

It’s 3rd & 2 for the Panthers at their own 30 yard line. Newton passes to Corey Brown who then picks up 11 yards.

The Carolina defense swarms Siemian but the rookie QB manages to scramble and pick up 11 yards for a 1st down at the Denver 39. It wash’t quite Newton-esque, but a fairly impressive job by Siemian there. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.45pm EDT 22:45 Panthers 17-7 Broncos, 4:10, 3rd quarter A second straight penalty on Carolina. False start this time. That’s a 5 yard penalty. It’s 3rd and 30 now and not even Newton can make something happen here. His pass to Benjamin results in 13 yards, which isn’t gonna cut it. Here comes the punting unit again. Lee uncorks a 61 yard punt that Norwood receives at the 7 yard line and takes to the Denver 22. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.43pm EDT 22:43 Panthers 17-7 Broncos, 5:27, 3rd quarter Newton looked hurt at the end of the last drive, but he’s back out for the Panthers. He’s swamped again by the Broncos defense on first down and has to throw it away, just missing an intentional grounding call. Newton’s next pass is incomplete as well. The crowd, booing just minutes ago, is now as loud as it has been all game. On 3rd down, Newton scrambles and gets the ball to Stewart for a 22 yard gain… BUT there’s a flag on the play. Face mask on Carolina. 15 yard penalty, no play. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.39pm EDT 22:39 Panthers 17-7 Broncos, 5:51, 3rd quarter So, the punt and the holding penalty puts the Broncos at their 15 yard. That could have gone worse for Carolina. Anderson picks up a yard on 1st down. On 2nd down, Sieman passes to Anderson, who actually loses five yards this time. This has gone sour pretty swiftly. And Siemian passes to Virgil Green who can only get the ball back to the Denver 15. Here come the punting team. Ginn takes the punt 8 yards to the Carolina 39.

How This Tech in Self-Driving Cars Is Paving a Road Beyond Silicon Fortune 9/8/2016 Katie Fehrenbacher © Provided by Fortune DRI.07.01.16.Driverless Car.google car In the future, self-driving cars will require laser-based sensing tech, and these systems will need new types of high-speed transistors and chips that can beat out silicon. Popular Searches Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.48 +0.06 +0.08% DryShips Inc DRYS ▲ 73.00 +30.14 +70.32% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▼ 24.88 -0.52 -2.05% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 744.25 +1.01 +0.14% That’s the assertion of Alex Lidow, a Stanford PhD physicist, entrepreneur, and CEO and founder of Efficient Power Conversion (commonly called EPC), a company based in El Segundo, Calif. that makes transistors and chips out of a material that operates more quickly and efficiently--and costs less than silicon. Yes, silicon--the backbone of all things computing and the juice behind the rise of tech giants like Google and Apple--has a little-known competitor. It’s called gallium nitride, or GaN, and the semiconductor can create transistors (the things that go on chips) that are fast, small, energy efficient, and low cost. While silicon has dominated computing to date, it turns out that the massive amount of information that needs to be detected and processed on the fly by self-driving cars is a perfect early application for GaN transistors. Some companies that are looking to make fully autonomous cars (not just computer-assisted driving) like Google are relying on Lidar technology, which fires out a laser light beam around the car to create a high-resolution 3D map of the surrounding environment. That laser map combined with cameras and smart software, is enough information for a car to drive itself on a road without a human driver. EPC’s chips and transistors fire the Lidar system’s laser at a blazing fast speed--fast enough to help the car rapidly determine the distance and placement of surrounding objects as well as to create an accurate-enough 3D map. “GaN is crucial” for the self-driving Lidar car system, says Lidow, as it can operate 100 times--or even a 1,000 times--faster than silicon, depending on the application. Mere seconds can mean the difference between a car detecting and reacting to an object or unfortunately not. Earlier this year, Tesla’s autonomous car tech, which doesn’t use Lidar, failed to detect a white tractor trailer driving toward a Model S against the backdrop of a bright sky. The accident resulted in a fatality. Lidow says that his company sells GaN chips or transistors to every car company that is using Lidar for self-driving cars today. Some companies, like Tesla rely on radar systems instead of Lidar. But Lidow thinks all self-driving cars, even Tesla, will eventually need to adopt Lidar. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Historically, Lidar has been prohibitively expensive to use on cars. The first Google goog mapping vehicles and self-driving cars employed ultra-expensive Lidar systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars or more. But today, a handful of companies are trying to push the cost of Lidar systems down to as little as several hundred dollars. Lidow founded EPC in 2007 after decades of working on transistor technology. In 1977, he invented a silicon transistor that switches electronic signals in devices. “I noticed silicon was coming to the end of its valuable life,” says Lidow. Lidow and a business partner in Taiwan funded and almost completely own the company. By 2014, Lidow says EPC’s cost to make GaN transistors was finally lower than the cost of making silicon ones. “For the first time in history, GaN is higher-performance and lower-cost,” says Lidow. Today, EPC almost doubled its revenue in 2016 versus 2015, and expects to triple its revenue in 2017 over this year. The company’s Lidar transistors represent between 15% to 20% of its businesses today, while chips and transistors for data center servers, drones, wireless power, medical devices, wireless base stations, and other tech make up the rest of the business. Lidar is becoming a hot topic for tech companies as everyone from Google to Tesla to reportedly Apple race to build autonomous car tech. Startups are emerging to lower the cost of Lidar tech, like Silicon Valley startup Quanergy Systems, which is building a Lidar system that’s supposed to cost $250. If Lidar can get that cheap, then regular cars--those that don’t drive themselves--could employ the tech as just a better sensor. “If it’s cheap enough, it’ll be on all cars, independent of autonomy,” says Lidow. For Lidow, he’s not just focused on what a world with self-driving cars would look like, but more so on how the world will operate after the fall of silicon. He says, speaking on the phone from southern California, “Silicon can have its Valley, we’ll take GaN Beach.” Go to MSN Home More in Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from Fortune Here Are the Electronics You Want This Holiday Season Fortune Here’s Why Twitter Banning ‘Alt-Right’ Accounts Is a Risky Strategy Fortune Brexit Is a Mess, But the U.K. Economy Keeps Humming Along Fortune How American Manufacturers Are Working to Close the ‘Skills Gap’ Fortune Fortune View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Google Maps' App Adds Alternatives to Booking an Uber Ride Fortune 9/8/2016 Kia Kokalitcheva Google Maps just became the ride-hailing app you always wanted. Popular Searches Target Corp TGT ▲ 75.80 +4.36 +6.10% Lowe's Companies Inc LOW ▼ 67.21 -1.85 -2.67% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 743.89 +0.65 +0.09% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▼ 31.59 -0.12 -0.36% Google on Thursday said that it was adding ride-hailing services Lyft and Gett in the U.S. to its mapping service. A button for ordering a Lyft ride will now appear inside the Google Maps app along with a similar one for ordering a Gett ride in New York City, the only U.S. city where Gett operates. The move gives users more options in Google Maps beyond Uber, which was already available through Google Maps in addition to other transportation options like public transit, walking, and driving. Gett was previously available for U.K. users. Users who already have Lyft, Gett, or Uber on their phones will see fare estimates and pickup times in the Google Maps app when they search for an address. From there, they can select a ride-hailing service and be taken to its mobile app so they can immediately request a ride. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Although Uber’s inclusion in Google Maps was intended to make the Maps app more useful, adding other services like Lyft make the service more comprehensive. Naturally, several other companies have tried to create a similar one-stop shop for ordering rides. One company, Corral Rides, a now-defunct San Francisco startup built one such aggregator in 2013, but it quickly ran into trouble after it lost access to both Uber and Lyft’s data (which it got without permission). What’s more, Uber’s terms of use for outside developers that want to tap into its data specifically prohibits them from adding Uber to an app alongside its competitors. In other words, an app for hailing both Uber and Lyft is a no-no. We couldn’t find the relevant section on Lyft’s website for developers, but it likely has similar rules. This, of course, raises the question of how Google was able to do this. It turns out, Google, along with others like Facebook, formally partnered with Uber, so its rules for independent outside developers don’t apply, according to a Uber spokeswoman. A Lyft spokesman offered a similar explanation, but declined to comment on whether it has a financial arrangement with Google.© Provided by Fortune A driver displays Uber and Lyft ride sharing signs on his car windscreen in Santa Monica Citymapper, a mapping app similar to Google Maps, also offers fare and pickup time estimates for both Uber and Lyft, because it has partnered with them, like Google. The timing of these new additions to the Google Maps app comes amid a recent chilling in the relationship between Google and Uber. Less than two weeks ago, Google head of corporate development, David Drummond, confirmed that he had quietly stepped down from Uber’s board several weeks prior due to increasing conflicts of interest (Google is experimenting with its own carpooling service). David Krane, the new head of GV, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has also reportedly been getting cut off from information from Uber, presumably for competitive reasons.

Photo: Bloomberg New York: Google is buying software development toolmaker Apigee Corp. for $625 million, the latest move by the search giant to bulk up its cloud-based offerings for businesses. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has agreed to pay $17.40 a share in cash, San Jose, California-based Apigee said in a statement Thursday. That’s a 6.5% premium to Apigee’s closing price on Wednesday. The companies expect the deal to be completed by the end of the year. Apigee sells a platform that aids companies in managing their APIs, which are programming tools that help developers build software that talks to each other and shares information without revealing the underlying code. APIs have become an integral part of cloud software development, allowing one application to pull data and use services from multiple other programs. “The addition of Apigee’s API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers’ move to supporting their businesses with high quality digital interactions,” Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google’s cloud business, said in a blog post, referring to application program interface products. Apigee counts among its customers Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., AT&T Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Burberry Group PLC. Walgreens uses Apigee to offer APIs and analyze how the tools are being used. Developers, for instance, can easily incorporate a feature into their apps that allows users to print photos at any Walgreens store, Greene said. Google has been working on bulking up its enterprise-focused products, having lagged behind Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in selling its public cloud computing software to companies. Greene joined Google late last year to lead the effort and has focused on broadening Google’s tool set to attract less technically savvy customers. The Apigee acquisition will also help support Google’s own set of APIs, which include ones that allow developers to pull information from YouTube as well as the Translate and Maps software to imbed in their own apps. “They’re looking for assets to build out their cloud business,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Clearly this fits into that area and they are looking for specific niches where they can really differentiate themselves.” Google was little changed at $802.42. The shares were up 3.9% this year through Wednesday. Apigee jumped 6.7% to $17.44.

But Google is working to use the technique as a way of combating the spread of online terrorist recruitment and propaganda. Several online firms, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, have been accused of not doing enough to prevent terror organizations, especially ISIS, from utilizing their services. The issue has led to several lawsuits being filed against the companies by the relatives of those killed in terrorist atrocities. But according to a report by Wired, Google-owned tech incubator and think tank – Jigsaw – has spent the last year developing the Redirect Method, which combines Google’s search advertising algorithms and YouTube’s video platform to hopefully dissuade potential recruits from joining ISIS and undo the group’s brainwashing. "The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign: Let's take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS' recruitment messaging and instead show them information that refutes it," said Jigsaw's head of research and development Yasmin Green. "This came out of an observation that there's a lot of online demand for ISIS material, but there are also a lot of credible organic voices online debunking their narratives." The method is activated whenever someone Googles one of 1700 keywords or phrases that Jigsaw believes people with ISIS sympathies often search for. In among the results will be ads containing links to English- and Arabic-language YouTube videos that contain testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing the group, and even long food lines in the ISIS’s Syrian stronghold Raqqa. “The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign: Let’s take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS’ recruitment messaging and instead show them information that refutes it,” Green added. The method has already proved successful; in a two-month trial earlier this year, more than 300,000 people were drawn into Jigsaw’s chosen YouTube channels. Later this month, there will be a second-phase relaunch of the project targeting both potential ISIS recruits and white supremacists in North America. Green pointed out that the Redirect method isn’t used to track or trace those who it sends to the YouTube channels. "These are people making decisions based on partial, bad information," she said. "We can affect the problem of foreign fighters joining the Islamic State by arming individuals with more and better information."

Well, fortunately at least that one isn’t actually on fire, but you get the idea. With up to nine new pieces of gear ready to be unveiled, Google is seemingly ready to enter the one tech-related realm it was awkwardly unfamiliar with. And when your name is “Google“, well, that comes with some serious liability… We may soon have a full ecosystem that more or less runs entirely on Google machines: tablets, laptops, smartwatches, streaming devices, virtual assistants in the form of home speakers, a VR headset, even your car and TV (although solely via software — at least for now). Whatever you may be thinking of, in a year or so Google will likely have you covered, with products that — again save for things like TVs and cars — the company itself makes. (Yes, we know about those other Google-built cars, but that’s another story.) We all know that the central hub of the entire ecosystem is and ostensibly will remain, at least for the foreseeable future, the smartphone. Sure, the market is saturated and general sales are slowing down, with products that are iterative rather than revolutionary, but that doesn’t mean that people will suddenly stop buying them, nor that the focus will shift on other products. If it does, that’s likely because your smartphone will become the essential gearwheel needed for the whole thing to work, and we will therefore simply take it for granted. Think VR: Google’s push has been explicitly towards mobile VR, and while standalone headsets may become popular one day, it is undeniable that it is your phone that will play a crucial role in the years to come — hence the push towards better displays and more powerful GPUs. But there’s more than that. Whereas Nexus phones have so far been what I would call nice “boxes” for Google to showcase Android as they intended it, taking over the mantle in the entire hardware department must come as a responsibility. If Google, as it appears, really does decide to finally cave in and put out the first true “Google phone”, then I personally feel that our expectations should be higher than usual. I’ve always frowned a bit at the Nexus program exactly because of its lack of tight integration between hardware and software, and was often proven right when met with products that failed to delight. Sure, Nexus phones have historically been a great way to get good specs for relatively cheap, and most of all your gateway to Google’s software without annoying middlemen. And last year’s 6P also managed to finally step up the game in the camera department, but I can still hear the echo of people complaining about the slowness of the dedicated app, quick launch and everything. I was happy with my phone, but it still felt a tad Frankenstein-ish to me, almost as if Huawei had made the shell and Google given life to it, but without talking much to each other, thus leaving crucial things such as performance and battery optimizations out. It was a love/hate relationship, a constant “It’s awesome, but“. I would rarely be able to uncompromisingly recommend a Nexus. After all, Google perhaps didn’t care; they wouldn’t produce loads and loads of units nor market the thing too much, and leave it to the Android enthusiasts and a few other folks. In this sense, expecting yet another Nexus phone to go much beyond that was disingenuous, and all in all the 6P still is a great device. However, it’s always pained me to admit that almost every time anyone would ask me about “the best Android phone they could buy”, I would rarely be able to uncompromisingly recommend a Nexus. It’s why so many people, unwilling to put up with anyone’s bloated software (but Google’s), simply ended up buying an iPhone. I feel like this can’t happen anymore. For one, I’d try and think about this sudden name change. This is not just something new, but an attempt to try and unify the company’s entire hardware efforts under one consumer oriented brand name that people will have to resonate with. Sure, Google is not going to become Apple overnight, and chances are you’ll never see “Pixel” become as ubiquitous as, say, “iPhone”, but rather something akin to what Microsoft is doing with its Surface line. So naturally, Google will push the whole Pixel thing more than it’s ever done in the past (rumor has it that big carriers are going to have them in store), and make a strong statement that the often hidden, underlying software thousands and thousands of people use has a proper, in-house made flagship companion. Marketing is absolutely crucial here, because your average Joe needs to at least know that Google — the same company that provides them with YouTube and Gmail — is making a beautiful little phone all by itself; then, hopefully good reviews and word of mouth will do the rest. It may — scratch that, will — take a while, but it’s a necessary step to secure the most important part of the increasingly bigger and important ecosystem. Photo: Alex Washburn / Wired And going back to the responsibility issue, it all fundamentally comes down to one thing: coura… alright, maybe not. But it is about reliability. I want to be able to trust Google’s hardware as much as I do with its software. I want to be able to answer that question and confidently say “get a Pixel”, this time not followed by a “but…”. I want to know that a Pixel phone is not just a shortcut to the latest version of Android, but a fantastic overall device that’s not afraid to go head to head with the latest from Samsung (which, to me, means a lot — even software wise). We need to finally have the one reference device we can point frustrated ex-Apple customers as well as old-time Android converts to, especially now that the smartphone game has become a fight to the bottom. The iPhone 7 is likely going to be another home run for Apple, mind you (it’s still a great phone, by all means), but far from the outlandish and industry-pushing device it used to be in years past. For all its ravishing beauty, it’s admittedly a phone that’s playing catch-up; and, eventually, people will notice it. Unless caught up in Apple’s own web, they may start looking elsewhere, and I’m not sure Samsung will fulfill those needs the way Google could. Much like the Cupertino firm, Mountain View’s offering should be what my colleague Stephen rightly calls “an undeniably polished package”, that however boosts Google’s (and Google’s only) quickly-becoming-superior software and integrated services. It doesn’t necessarily need to be the best at everything (someone will always have a slightly better camera or maybe a fancier design), but most definitely a device that people can trust to be their centerpiece in the broader Google ecosystem — one that won’t let them down no matter what they do and that’s easy to recognize and buy for everyone, even the less tech-savvy among us. It’s long overdue. Also please, Google. Add that multi-color light bar. It’s cool.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Why healthcare needs to care about Google's acquisition of Apigee Pitney Bowes bets on digital logistics and APIs to move beyond meters Why every CIO needs to know that some APIs don’t matter Video Transforming development in the race to innovate Alphabet’s Google today announced plans to acquire Apigee Systems for $625 million, paying a 6.5 percent premium in a deal that reflects how Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have become critical threads connecting disparate software systems. Apigee, which went public in 2015 and in May reported revenue of $67 million for the third quarter, makes software that enables developers to use APIs to securely share their data across applications and devices from third-parties, a critical activity for companies attempting digital transformations. Google today announced plans to acquire Apigee Systems for $625 million. Diane Greene, a Google senior vice president, wrote in a corporate blog post today that APIs are the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact. "Instead of the doctor phoning a prescription into the pharmacy, they can use an app that talks to the pharmacy through an API,” Greene wrote. Digital transformations for everyone Google’s acquisition of Apigee seems fitting. Google, along with Silicon Valley rivals Apple and Facebook, has popularized the practice of sharing APIs with third-party programmers and businesses in a bid to build out web and mobile platforms. Greene's pharmacy example wasn’t accidental. Pharmacy retail giant Walgreens has used Apigee's software since 2012 to enable developers to build software that allows consumers to print photos and refill prescriptions from the Walgreens mobile app. It has publicly referred to this strategy as "putting an API around our stores." Apigee also counts AT&T and Staples among its 300-plus customers. A pharmaceutical retailer, a telecommunications goliath and an office supplies chain appear to have little in common, but their business roadmaps share a theme in using APIs as the cornerstones of platform strategies to attract digitally savvy consumers. However, giant Pitney Bowes is using Apigee to build mailing and logistics applications to help companies sell and ship their products and services online, a critical piece of a multi-year digital transformation that began in 2013, James Fairweather, Pitney's senior vice president of technology told CIO.com earlier this year Pitney Bowes, Walgreens and Staples are not outliers. A recent Forrester Research survey revealed that 40 percent of developers are using external APIs, with another 25 percent interested in using them or planning to do so. The firm also found that U.S. companies alone will spend nearly $3 billion on API management software by 2020. Not a one-API-platform race Apigee has limited competition in API management. However, one of those competitors is Akana. Airline Aeromexico recently launched a new website and check-in kiosks using Akana’s API management software. The technologies, part of a digital transformation to help the airline better serve consumers (including those traveling between 45 destinations within Mexico, 17 in the U.S. and 15 in Latin America), reduce transaction processing time by 50 percent and increase the number of customers being checked in without assistance. Airline Aeromexico recently launched new check-in kiosks using API management software from Apigee competitor Akana. (Click for larger image.) Aeromexico CIO Benjamin Hernandez tells CIO.com that using Akana technology will give the airline the control it needs to gain competitive differentiation, capabilities it lacked in the technology that powered its previous ecommerce software. “We want to differentiate ourselves in everything that touches our passengers and also the way we commercialize our products,” says Hernandez. Peter Duhart, director for ecommerce at Aeromexico, says the airline will eventually use Akana to host APIs for its new mobile application, which will include check-in capabilities as well push notifications that keep passengers posted about gate and flight status and baggage claim numbers. The company is also mulling using chatbots that automate customer service. Meanwhile, Apigee's technology will help Google accelerate enterprises’ efforts to facilitate digital interactions, says Google's Greene, who joined the company last year in an effort to build out its cloud infrastructure business. “A good API needs to support security, give developers the freedom to work in the development environment of their choice and allow the company to continue to innovate its service while supporting a stable interface to the apps and services using the API,” Greene writes. Greene adds that Google in the future will integrate Apigee technology with its Kubernetes container orchestration software to help enterprises get better control and visibility into how their internal systems talk to one another. Buying Apigee suggests that Google wants to get a big piece of the business of managing digital services, Gartner analyst Paolo Malinverno tells CIO.com. “Apigee is arguably the best platform for it,” Malinverno says.

Roston - Sep 8, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Back in March, Google added a ride services section to Google Maps that presents various ride services with how soon you could take them and about how much they’d cost. The idea is that you probably don’t have time to toggle between a bunch of different apps to figure out which transportation method is the fastest — using this ride services tab, you can see in one glance whether it would, for example be faster to take an Uber car or a taxi; or, alternatively, whether one option would be cheaper than another. In a statement today, Google announced it has updated that ride services integration with two new companies. Starting today, you’ll also see options for Lyft and Gett in the ride services tab, assuming you’re in the U.S. This brings the options up to nine ridesharing partners across 60 countries, according to Google, though which ones you see will depend on where you’re located, of course. Checking out the ride service options is pretty simple — you put in your address and your destination in Google Maps. Once those are entered, the ride services tab will appear in the same row as the driving/transit/walking/etc options. Tap on it and you’ll see whatever ridesharing partners have vehicles available for your needs, about how much the trip will cost on them, and about how long you’ll wait for the car to show up. As the image shows, you’ll also see the specific option that is available through that partner — so if UberX is the only thing available from Uber, that’s what you’ll see, or you may see multiple options like UberX and the company’s carpooling service. The same goes for Lyft and Gett. You’ll only see Gett options if you’re located in New York City, though. The options have been added to both the Android and iOS apps.

The augmented reality (AR) game has broken records, skyrocketing to the top of the iOS and Google Play stores in a matter of weeks while simultaneously opening the floodgates to make AR—a term previously relegated to the ‘techies’ of the world—into a staple of the mainstream lexicon.   A Shot in the Arm for ARt There’s now been a mass awakening toward AR’s applications, one that will undoubtedly bleed into other industries. Since the technology has effectively dug its way into the prevailing cultural conversation, it’s only a matter of time before the public begins to take notice of other, more creative ways to take advantage of it—especially in the fluid, abstract world of art. Art culture is sometimes preconceived as being ‘stuffy’ or ‘inaccessible,’ thus presenting an obstacle toward translating its poignancy to more casual audiences (especially those that don’t typically have easy access to truly understand its beauty). Enter AR. On the heels of Pokémon Go’s success, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities to bridge the gap between a static medium and cutting edge high-tech know-how. After all, the magic of ‘Go’ isn’t just capturing the rare mythical beasts around you, it’s in the way that the game is able to transform your surroundings from bland city streets into a veritable hunting ground for a make-believe realm. It’s about transcending everyday perception and role-playing a fantasy. The best part about it, however, is that the experience can be shared with thousands of people around you. That reasoning alone is why the marriage of technology and the art world is so interesting; both concepts allow people to change their conscious view of the world and get swept up into new planes of understanding. Tech giants have seen the possibilities, and have already begun to jump on other more recent emerging tech trends, peeling back the layers of application relative to art and creativity. A Digital Revolution for Cultural AwAReness Niantic’s (the company behind Pokémon Go) latest foray into AR gaming isn’t only a fun experience. It’s one that has had an external effect that’s already helping the game’s millions of users discover previously unknown bits of cultural knowledge about their surroundings (thanks to the company’s tactical placement of the in-game world’s treasure-filled markers known as ‘Pokestops’). Upon arriving at one of these markers, players are greeted with a photo of a featured landmark and the opportunity to learn more about it. Many times, these informational cornucopias are laden around mosaics, sculptures, old churches and cathedrals, and more, thus stealthily becoming a medium for artistic discovery. According to a recent article by the Denver Post, Pokémon Go has inadvertently triggered audiences young and old to venture out and unearth the history behind long standing neighborhoods and century-old architecture, proving that the game’s presence is truly a gateway for art consumption. Also, consider the case of Google Tilt. One of Google’s first forays into the art world, the Tilt Brush enables people to paint in 3D using virtual reality technology. Users strap on a headset, and suddenly the space around them becomes their canvas; using the Tilt Brush, they can layer their artwork over their “real world” surroundings. The current VR space (and later, mixed reality) was a natural progression from augmented reality, which was first brought to mobile devices dating as far back as 2003. The ARtist’s Journey There’s inherent value that people find in altering their surroundings with traditional art. Introducing the ability to do the same in a different version of ‘reality’ expounds that value, because it allows for untapped exploration. Already, there are art galleries that explore virtual and augmented reality—as was the case when artist and sculptor Josue Abraham opened up his Virtualidades exhibit. At first glance, the gallery was filled with broken works, but upon seeing each one through the lens of a mobile phone, viewers were greeted with the complete picture of every broken mannequin or mangled sculpture. This is a perfect case study on the creativity involved in spurring audiences to see through a different set of ‘eyes’—to look outside the box of what’s on the surface and expand perception through a new medium. Pokémon Go influence has also been felt in a more sobering aspect thanks to a unique collection of work from Syrian artist Khaled Akil with his “Pokémon Go in Syria,” series. It illustrated what Pokémon inserted into the war torn landscapes of the land would look like. Since the game isn’t available in that specific region, Photoshop had to suffice. The main point, however, is that the game’s technology was a catalyst in driving the conception of a nominal example of artistry that depicted the harrowing co-optation of pop cultural phenomenon and geopolitical horror. Niantic’s powerhouse hit has literally become an avenue for social commentary through art. These examples help blur the lines between tech and culture. More importantly, they show how technology is both indispensable, and at the same time inescapable relative to the creative process. The art world is now finally integrating the two, which is giving a new generation of artists the tools to conceive inventive pieces of art, while simultaneously pushing the digital envelope farther than ever before. Even more importantly, AR (and emerging tech like it) is helping make art much more relevant to a larger general audience. As an inherently creative enterprise, art has constantly reinvented itself and explored different platforms. With augmented reality becoming a household concept, we’ll increasingly see creative spins on the format, with artists harnessing its capabilities to bring art to previously untapped audiences (while introducing them to all the possibilities that art has to offer). This new frontier will, undoubtedly, bring about a revolution in visual culture. The fun part is witnessing how it happens.  Vladimir Vukicevic is the CEO of Meural, a new platform that combines software and hardware to make art universally accessible. Meural specializes in a digital connected canvas that fosters expression and discovery. Vukicevic has taught Fortune 500 companies how to leverage new media platforms and has combined culture with management theory through his writing. He believes that technology provides a new path to creative and entrepreneurial empowerment. He also sits on the board of directors for the New York Foundation for the Arts—one of the oldest and most impactful non-profit arts organizations in the world.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google has agreed to pay $17.40 a share in cash, San Jose, Calif.-based Apigee said Thursday. That's a 6.5 percent premium to Apigee's closing price Wednesday. The companies expect the deal to be completed by the end of the year. Apigee sells a platform that aids companies in managing their APIs, which are programming tools that help developers build software that talks to each other and shares information without revealing the underlying code. VIDEOS TOP JOBS APIs have become an integral part of cloud software development, allowing one application to pull data and use services from multiple other programs. "The addition of Apigee's API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers' move to supporting their businesses with high quality digital interactions," Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's cloud business, said in a blog post, referring to application program interface products. Apigee counts among its customers Walgreens Boots Alliance, AT&T, Live Nation Entertainment and Burberry Group. Walgreens uses Apigee to offer APIs and analyze how the tools are being used. Developers, for instance, can easily incorporate a feature into their apps that allows users to print photos at any Walgreens store, Greene said. Google has been working on bulking up its enterprise-focused products, having lagged behind Amazon.com and Microsoft in selling its public cloud computing software to companies. Greene joined Google late last year to lead the effort and has focused on broadening Google's tool set to attract less technically savvy customers. The Apigee acquisition will also help support Google's own set of APIs, which include ones that allow developers to pull information from YouTube as well as the Translate and Maps software to imbed in their own apps. "They're looking for assets to build out their cloud business," said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. "Clearly this fits into that area and they are looking for specific niches where they can really differentiate themselves." Google was little changed at $802.42. The shares were up 3.9 percent this year through Wednesday. Apigee jumped 6.7 percent to $17.44.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Comments: Editorial: Time for Utah conservatives to stand against Breitbartism State audit dings University of Utah athletic department over hiring, travel and equipment; probe fi Students are stabbed at Utah school, but 'this was not retaliatory' Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

It has the skills to develop an IoT platform. And it certainly has the creds for security (the Chromebook remains unhackable to date). Yet today it announced a definitive agreement to acquire San Jose, Calif.-based Apigee, a company that offers all of the above and that has yet to turn a profit as a publicly-traded company. Google will pay $17.40 per share in cash for the company, for a total of $625 million, which Charles King, principal with Pund-IT told CMSWire, is a tidy sum. Apigee boasts some 300 high-caliber customers that it works with to create numerous and in some cases highly customized application connections with elaborate back-end systems, a key component in delivering successful digital interactions. King believes it is for this reason — the company's unique, almost concierge-like approach to API — that Google is acquiring Apigee.  Competing with AWS for the Cloud "Google is trying very hard to differentiate itself from Amazon Web Services (AWS)," King said. "Apigee's high quality of tools, its approach to security and its ability to support IoT, can help do that." Indeed, digital adoption and customer experience is only one part of what Apigee does — or to be specific, it is only one source of its revenues. Apigee's other major revenue source is the shift to the cloud.  "Even if a company was not going to build any new digital applications but simply wanted to migrate their existing back-end applications from a mainframe or client/server system to a cloud system, that would create a variety of challenges in particular having to do with security, management and those type of issues that APIs could be the answer to solve how that works," Kevin Faulkner, Apigee's vice president of investor relations told the audience at the Stifel Technology Internet & Media Conference held this past June. Apigee's Many Attributes Fresh from her appearance at BoxWorks, Senior Vice President of Google Cloud platform Diane Greene announced the buy in a blog post on Thursday, hitting all the high notes of Apigee's long list of attributes. She noted the hundreds of companies that Apigee has as clients, including Walgreens, AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, First Data and Live Nation. Walgreens, she wrote, "uses Apigee to manage the APIs that enable an ecosystem of partners and developers building apps using Walgreens APIs, including the Photo Prints API (enabling mobile app developers to include the ability for their app users to print photos at any Walgreens store), and the Prescription API (enabling users to quickly order refills of prescriptions right from their mobile app)." According to its quarterly report, Apigee added nine new Fortune 500 customers — including three in the Fortune 100 — in its latest quarter and also added two new customers from the Fortune Global 500. Bye-Bye Joint Marketing with AWS?   Greene also highlighted Apigee's toolset and its security creds. "A good API needs to support security, give developers the freedom to work in the development environment of their choice and allow the company to continue to innovate its service while supporting a stable interface to the apps and services using the API," she wrote.   "Google cloud customers are already benefitting from no sys-ops dev environments, including Google App Engine and Google Container Engine. Now, with Apigee’s API management platform, they'll be able to front these secure and scalable services with a simple way to provide the exported APIs," she concluded. As for AWS? Somehow, one might conclude that Apigee's services may no longer be quite so available on its platform. If so, this could pose a setback for Amazon. Apigee has delivered a reference architecture for AWS deployments, and has also entered into joint marketing with AWS.  And then there are the customers, which include some marquee names. "Recently, Amazon and Apigee announced dozens of new customers using Edge in AWS, including AccuWeather, Allstate, OpenGov and Sage Payment Solutions," Apigee CEO Chet Kapoor said during the company’s earnings call. Which clients will leave with Apigee is yet to be determined, but Google will acquire the technology, the team and Apigee clients when the deal is finalized. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by Apigee shareholders. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Think of Microsoft’s New Outlook Customer Manager as Salesforce Light Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong Hubspot Unveils GrowthBot, a Chatbot for Sales & Marketing How API Integrations Help Your Back Office Work Faster, Smarter Enterprise Search Means Finding Information, Not Just Documents Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers AvePoint Adds File Sync & Share for Microsoft SharePoint Alfresco Primes Its Activiti Pump Useful Article?

BRUSSELS: US tech giants Google and Facebook are among multinationals spending more in Brussels as the European Commission eyes new business regulation after last week handing Apple a 13-billion-euro tax demand. A new annual filing by Google to the EU's Transparency Register showed it spent roughly 15-20 percent more on lobbying European Union officials and lawmakers last year than in 2014, itself some three times as much as in the year before that. A review by Reuters of EU lobbying budgets of a handful of leading US firms which have been in the spotlight of European regulatory debates showed Google among the biggest spenders of all corporations, reporting a budget of $4.8-5.1 million in 2015. That compared to 3.5-4.0 million euros the year before and 1.25-1.5 million euros in 2013. A spokesman for the company, which has been served with three sets of charges in the past two years by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, said its 14 staff involved in lobbying in Brussels were there to provide information. "European politicians have many questions for Google and about the Internet. We're working hard to answer those questions, helping policymakers understand our business and the opportunity for European businesses to grow online," he said. Google's annual Transparency Register filing, publicized on Wednesday by anti-corruption group Transparency International, appeared online coincidentally on Aug. 30. On that day European Competition Commissioner Vestager ordered Apple to pay a record $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland after ruling that the US firm had effectively had illegal subsidies from Dublin. The iPhone maker did not respond to a request for comment on its lobbying in Brussels, where it has been advertising since July for a new government affairs manager to "represent Apple's position with policymakers". Its EU declaration of spending a modest 800,000-900,000 euros last year and employing just five staff working part-time on lobbying has prompted speculation that it may have underplayed its hand -- though EU officials insist that they are not influenced by high-pressure corporate lobbying.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

And yet, for some reason, very few employees select an official company headshot. From photos of children to family pets and office selfies, many choose a different image for each app. So, what’s the big deal? Why should companies care that employees are not using their HR-approved headshot for business email and applications? Security magazine spoke to David Meyer, VP of Product for OneLogin, who says that the wrong profile photo could provide hackers with data that can be hacked. "Since the majority of passwords are constructed from names of people or pets, when an employee's photo is his kid on Basecamp and his dog in Slack, a quick Google or Facebook search can tell a cybercriminal the names that an employee may be using as his or her password," he says. "In addition, personal photos can provide hackers with intel on the user that can be used to plan a more targeted cyberattack," he says. "For example, a photo of you with your colleagues can provide hackers the information they need to develop a more sophisticated phishing scheme. They have a sense of who you work with, so they have a better idea of how to tailor their message to avoid suspicion." Why not just force employees not to use passwords that are constructed to their relatives or family? Meyer told Security magazine: "While password policies and training are important, companies can never be completely assured that employees won’t compromise sensitive information. The company needs a safety net – another layer of security that will account for human error. This is where Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions come into the picture. IAM tools help provide a secure portal for users to access business applications." What strategy does a company have to use to require employees to sync their physical and digital identities? Meyer suggests: "Employees need to educate employees about the security risks of using multiple user profile photos for business applications. They also need to develop a policy that will require employees to sync their user profile photos. The best way to enforce a user profile policy is to automate the process. HR should take a photo of each employee during the on-boarding process. These headshots should be stored in an HR application such Workday, UltiPro and Namely. The companies IAM solution should be able to automatically pull in the photos from these apps. As soon as the photo changes in the IAM tool’s cloud directory, it will be pushed to all the user’s apps and devices. For companies that don’t have the technology to automate the process, users can manually upload their HR approved photo to each of their applications."   Did you enjoy this article?

If you use the ad giant's Chrome browser, and a lot of people do, in its 56th build and onwards any website that does not use a security certificate will feature a red exclamation mark and the text "Not secure," also in red, at the start of the web address. Those that do use certificates and so have an HTTPS connection will continue to get a nice little green padlock icon. The decision was announced on Google's security blog and will "help users browse the web safely." It is part of "a long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure." If a website is not secured, it is possible for someone else to interfere with the website before you see it, if they are on the same network. For a long time, only websites with serious security concerns bothered to get a certificate – like businesses taking payments or banks allowing people to log into their accounts. Over time, however, it has grown increasingly important to include additional security. Google notes that more than half the pages accessed through Chrome are now HTTPS – something it has decided is a milestone. Despite its long existence, introducing a security certificate to a website can still throw up problems. There is also an additional and persistent cost that is small, but still acts as a barrier to small businesses in particular. Google worries that users are really aware of the potential risk they face if they provide login details and credit card information to a website that does not have an electronic security certificate. Of course, HTTPS does not provide a certainty of security. Just this week a study showed that millions of internet-connected devices make the keys used for encrypting information readily available, immediately undermining whatever additional security the certificate provides. Not everyone is excited about the prospect of moving to full HTTPS, either. As one NASA sysadmin pleaded earlier this year, lots of people rely on plain old HTTP to peer-share information. "Studies show that users do not perceive the lack of a 'secure' icon as a warning," his post states. "Users [also] become blind to warnings that occur too frequently." Chrome 56 will label HTTP pages with password or credit card form fields as "not secure," and future releases will extend that approach to all HTTP pages if people are visiting them in its "incognito" mode. "Eventually, we plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that we use for broken HTTPS," the post says. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 95 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Google will soon call out websites for not being secure by Danielle Wiener-Bronner   @CNNTech September 9, 2016: 6:34 PM ET Watch this hacker break into a company Google wants to make the Internet safer, and it won't be shy about pointing fingers at sites that don't meet its standards. In an announcement published to the Google Security Blog on Thursday, the search giant said users of its Chrome browser will be warned when accessing non-secure websites, starting January 2017. Users won't be blocked from accessing non-secure sites, but they will be alerted when visiting an address that doesn't use an encrypted connection. Websites with a "HTTPS" added before the URL indicate an added level of security to normal web browsing, compared to visiting a non-secure "HTTP" connection. This guarantees users are reaching the website they intend to visit, and the extra security protects them against hackers. "When you load a website over HTTP, someone else on the network can look at or modify the site before it gets to you," Google explained in the statement. Related: Apple unveils iPhone 7 and new Watch Currently, the search engine indicates that HTTPS — note the "s" on the end — connections are secure with a green lock icon (broken HTTPS connections feature a red lock). However, Google (GOOG) does not currently flag HTTP connections as unsafe, though users can click on the information tab on HTTP sites to learn more about the connection. The next-generation version of Chrome, called Chrome 56, will start to mark HTTP connections as "not secure." "Studies show that users do not perceive the lack of a 'secure' icon as a warning, but also that users become blind to warnings that occur too frequently," Google explains. To avoid warning fatigue, Google will roll out its warnings gradually, eventually alerting users in Chrome's Incognito mode — which doesn't store users' search histories — that HTTP connections are not secure with a flashier image. Google said "more than half of Chrome desktop page loads are now served over a secure network." But only one-third of the top 100 non-Google sites use a secure connection as its default. Emily Schechter, Product Manager for Chrome Security, told CNNMoney only a handful of those top 100 non-Google sites have switched to a secure connection this year. "We have seen an additional 12 sites move to HTTPS by default [since March]," she said. Google hinted at the move years ago and reiterated the plan in January 2016. The announcement comes months ahead of the move to allow developers and sites enough time to migrate from to HTTPS before the change kicks in, Schechter explained. Switching over from HTTP won't affect sites' search rankings. Google is not alone in pushing for an encrypted Internet. In 2015, the White House announced that all federal websites must use a secure connection by the end of this year. The Internet Security Research Group's Let's Encrypt initiative helped 3.8 million sites move to a secure connection, according to a Wired report.

Goshen College campus newspaper Home News Features Arts Perspectives Sports Funnies Contact Igniting interest for females in computer science By Record September 08, 2016 0 Comment Features, lead Abby King Contributing Writer amking@goshen.edu Meghan Gerke and Jeanette Shown start IgniteCS program to get more women in computer science. Photo by Maddie Gerig. The future of female computer scientists lays in the hands of Jeanette Shown, associate professor of computer science and information technology, and Meghan Gerke, junior computer science major. This fall, Shown and Gerke will use their $8,500 grant from Google’s IgniteCS program to help spark interest in computer science in young girls at Goshen Middle School. IgniteCS focuses on “[making] a difference in local communities through [computer science] leadership,” according to their mission statement. Last year, Google contacted Shown after the deadline for the grant was due and asked if she would be interested in applying. “I think one of the reasons that I was tagged was because there aren’t very many female heads of science programs,” said Shown. Without hesitation, Shown and Gerke teamed up to write a curriculum for an outreach program aimed to help spur interest in computer programming for young girls within their local communities. With help and advice from Google staff, Gerke and Shown created a program that will hopefully draw the attention of girls ages 12-14 years old. Lack of women in computer science seems to be a consistent problem. “[Middle school] is the age group where young women drop out of mathematics and lose interest in computer science,” said Shown. “So I targeted a middle school.” Gerke and Shown said they are determined to teach at least 20 middle school girls that computer science is fun and a valuable skill. The outreach is also free to all Goshen Middle School girls, making this opportunity available to everyone, despite financial situations. Armed with “Raspberry Pi kits” – tiny computers that fit in the palm of one’s hand – and Minecraft, young girls at Goshen Middle school will learn the tools they need to become computer science whizzes. “Programs like [Minecraft] make you not realize you’re doing smart programming,” said Gerke. “It’s a fun game but it also incorporates the skills you’ve learned as well.” “People usually learn more when they’re having fun,” added Shown. The outreach will follow a “traditional route.” Gerke and other Goshen College students will teach young girls computer science either after school or Saturday sessions in a classroom setting. Just like Goshen College, the program will have a small student-to-mentor ratio, hopefully ranging around 4-5 middle schoolers per teacher. “[A small class size] would be a good start on what teaching should be like,” said Gerke. “It would make [programming] more understandable.” Goshen College will hopefully be receiving this grant next semester, as it is renewable. Gerke said her dream for the outreach would be to “turn it into a program where it comes back every year.” However, to turn the outreach into a yearly program, fresh new faces are a necessity. Shown and Gerke are currently accepting applications for mentors. Stipends of $1,000 will be given to those who acquire the position. “I think it’s exciting to talk to students about [computer science,]” said Gerke when asked what she looks forward to as the outreach draws closer. “We need to see more women in computer science,” said Shown. “Women change the dynamics.”   Tagged computer science females in science Written by Record No comments yet.

Dell Technologies has officially closed its acquisition of top-tier storage vendor EMC and its federated businesses 11 months after announcing the $60 billion-plus deal that will create a massive company that will compete across all segments of the enterprise IT landscape. Dell closed the deal Sept. 7, a week after Chinese antitrust regulators gave their approval. The acquisition creates a $74 billion company with 140,000 employees spread over 180 countries—including a 40,000-person sales force and 30,000 more in services. The merged companies will sell everything from PCs and data center infrastructure to hybrid cloud services, security, the internet of things and virtualization technology. Google's September Android security update provides users with patches for 55 vulnerabilities spread across three patch levels. Google first began to split Android updates into two patch levels with the July update, which fixed 108 security vulnerabilities. The basic idea behind the new three-patch model is to make it easier for handset vendors to deliver the most important patches for a subset of vulnerabilities. To date, Google has patched more than 115 media server-related Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures flaws in Android. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's Google subsidiary have filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting Microsoft's legal arguments in a lawsuit filed against the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this year. On April 14, Microsoft filed its suit against the U.S. government agency, arguing that a statute in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act violates both the First and Fourth Amendments and is unconstitutional. The statute, Section 2705(b), provides courts with so-called secrecy orders that prevent service providers from disclosing when the government is seeking customer data. Microsoft asserts that such gag orders violate the Fourth Amendment by not informing individuals that their property has been searched or seized by the government. In addition, the company said the law violates its own First Amendment right to free speech. Qualcomm is partnering with top-tier carriers AT&T and Verizon as it looks to gain traction in the emerging drone and internet of things markets. On the first day of the CTIA Super Mobility 2016 show Sept. 6 in Las Vegas, officials with the mobile chip maker said Qualcomm and AT&T plan to run tests to determine how well drones operate on commercial 4G LTE networks, which could help accelerate the use of drones in the corporate world. At the same time, Qualcomm will integrate Verizon's ThingSpace internet of things platform-as-a-service into one of its LTE modems. The idea is to make it more economical to connect many of the billions of devices that make up the IoT via LTE networks and to make it simpler to build, deploy and manage such devices.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

APIs "are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace," Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. "They're the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it's a small business applying online for a loan or a point-of-sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer," she added. For example, APIs can enable a business's computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. Apigee is used by hundreds of companies, including AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, Live Nation and Walgreens, according to Google. Adding Apigee to its team promises to raise Google's game against major competitors Amazon and Microsoft in the market to provide businesses with services in the internet cloud. Forrester, the independent market-research company, last year predicted that annual global spending on API management would top USD 1 billion by 2020. "The transition toward cloud, mobile and digital interaction with customers and partners via APIs is happening, and fast," Greene said. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulators and Apigee shareholders but is expected to be completed this year. "We've entered a new era of cloud computing, where enterprises are increasingly running business-critical applications in the cloud," Apigee chief executive Chet Kapoor said in a release.

But with some truth serum, here's what executives might have discussed: What we didn’t hear at Wednesday's iPhone 7 unveiling: *Virtual or augmented reality. The list of companies that have entered the virtual and/or augmented reality space reads like Who’s Who in the (Tech) Cast: Facebook, Google, Sony, Microsoft and Samsung. For now, Apple is an understudy, lest you factor in all the folks who got their first taste of AR playing Pokémon Go on an iPhone. In fact, Apple holds numerous patents in VR, and has made some high profile hires in the field. And Tim Cook stated recently that the company is “high on AR in the long run.” What we don’t know is how long Apple is willing to play the long game. Or what mixed reality approach or approaches it might take. Quick primer: Virtual reality fully immerses a user into computer generated virtual world. Augmented reality overlays the virtual on top of the real physical world. People wear the Samsung Gear VR virtual reality headset.  (Photo: Robyn Beck, AFP/Getty Images) Apple could deliver a VR headset along the lines of Samsung’s Gear VR, which is infused with Facebook-owned Oculus DNA, and requires the use of a compatible smartphone. It could more ambitiously do a VR headset that connects to a computer like the Oculus Rift or HTV Vive. Or follow Microsoft's lead with HoloLens, more AR than VR. Then again, Apple might go the mobile VR route as Google is doing with the upcoming Daydream platform for compatible Android phones. The new iPhone 7 Plus handset announced yesterday has two rear cameras which suggests some interesting possibilities in the AR realm—we'll have to see. But if Apple chooses to engage in a full throttle mobile VR battle against Daydream, we might have to wait for next year’s iPhone. At this stage we have a lot more questions than answers.

Apple announced that macOS Sierra, the latest version of its operating system for Macintosh computers, will be available to the public on Sept. 20. But while Sierra will let you spice up your current Mac, you'll have to wait a bit longer for new Mac hardware, including the next versions of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops. We could see these as soon as next month, though it is also possible that their introductions will slip into 2017. The Mac lineup is getting tired, and seems primed to take advantage of the latest chip technology from Intel. Bloomberg has reported that a new thinner MacBook Pro is in the works, with a flatter keyboard and a new secondary digital function key display feature above the keyboard that will dynamically change depending on the task at hand. And yes, Apple is characteristically  mum. *Apple Car. Tesla boss Elon Musk has called Apple’s electric vehicle an “open secret,” which seems to be the case given the hundreds of engineers reportedly working on the rumored project, including some apparently wooed away from Tesla. Assuming the rumors are true, we’re unlikely to see an Apple Car until 2021. Suffice it to say, Cook & Co. aren’t saying.

Video by Theresa Chong *What was left out of the iPhone 7. Apple of course had plenty to say about the new iPhone 7. How it has all these new camera features and how it is now water and dust resistant. Apple also defended its controversial and self-proclaimed “courageous” decision to remove the standard headphone jack, something I for one am not thrilled with. But while Apple also claims better battery life for the iPhone 7, it left out battery-related features that are already in use by Samsung on its Galaxy phones and on other competitive handsets. I’m speaking of fast charging batteries, which depending on the specs can get you at or near a full-charge in relatively short order. And batteries that can be charged wirelessly by placing them on a (typically optional) pad. One reason for Apple’s reluctance in providing a fast-charging solution may have to do with a reduction in the battery’s longevity. Such a possibility hasn’t prevented Samsung et al from offering a feature that is not only convenient, but is a potential lifesaver if you need to juice up in a hurry before boarding an airplane. Maybe Apple will get there—on next year’s iPhones. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Apple's iPhone 7 and new Apple Watch in photos  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

(Credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) For some lucky Virginia Tech students, there’s a whole new way to get their Chipotle fix. Project Wing, a drone project in Google’s X lab, will begin testing drone delivery of burritos at Virginia Tech later this month. Google expects to conduct a few hundred deliveries over the course of several days or potentially weeks. Burritos won’t be delivered just anywhere on campus. Testing will be confined to a closed site. Students and employees from an adjacent building will be invited to order burritos on a special kiosk and watch as their food is flown several hundred meters over open ground. The food will be prepared on site in a Chipotle truck. The drones — which will fly autonomously — will lower the burritos to the ground via a tether. Google said it chose to test food delivery to learn how to package sensitive cargo. The company sees far broader potential for drones, including delivering supplies to isolated areas after natural disasters. Google also sees drone delivery as a way to help the climate, and noted that in 2014 3.1 billion gallons of fuel were wasted in traffic congestion in the United States. Google has been testing drones since 2014, but on private land in California. In late August, federal rules for commercial drone flight went into effect, a landmark step toward drone delivery. “Last year while discussing the entrepreneurial spirit at Virginia Tech, I jokingly speculated we might one day have quadcopters delivering ramen noodles around campus — apparently I wasn’t off by much,” said Virginia Tech President Tim Sands in a statement. 36.874358 -76.174544 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Chipotle, Google, Virginia Tech Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Twitter Popular Teen Bicyclist Dies in ‘Tragic Collision’ on Way to School in Pacoima: LAPD JetBlue Flash Sale Offers Flights as Low as $34; Book by Wednesday Video Shows Chili’s Manager Taking Away Free Meal From Army Veteran in Texas Protesters March Through Los Angeles in Fourth Night of Anti-Trump Demonstrations Latest News Media Mogul Russell Simmons Talks Trump & New Yoga Center ‘Tantris’ Auli’i Cravalho Talks Being the Voice Behind Disney’s Newest Princess Vin Scully, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Recieve Presidential Medal of Freedom Jon Huertas Discusses Partnership With United Way Homewalk Nation/World Less Stringent Rules for Business-Drone Operators Take Effect Monday Money Smart Nation/World Chipotle Plans to Hire 5,000 Workers in One-Day Spree Amid Planned Expansion Nation/World Chipotle Under Fire After Federal Regulators Find Workplace Policies Violate Labor Laws Local News San Francisco Startup Offers Drone-Making Kit With Legos  Nation/World Domino’s Pizza in New Zealand Tests Pizza-Delivering Drone Technology Podcasting 101 Tech Smart with Rich DeMuro America on Demand: The Melt Tech Smart with Rich DeMuro America on Demand: Buddytruk Nation/World Drone, Social Media Lead to Hurricane Flood Rescue in North Carolina Technology Flying the Compact, Fold-Up DJI Mavic Pro Drone Technology Google Unveils Pixel Smartphone with “Best Camera Ever” Technology Fantastic Audio, Unique Wide Angle Lens Make LG V20 Perfect for Social Media Sharing Technology The Melt’s High Tech Smartbox Keeps Your French Fries Crispy Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2016, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Security FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Chrome 56 to Mark Some HTTP Pages as Insecure GO Google plans to mark all HTTP pages as insecure Sep 8, 2016 19:40 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Chrome 56, set for release in January 2017, will start marking HTTP pages that contain sensitive content such as passwords or payment forms as insecure, Google has announced today. Google's end goal is to mark all HTTP pages with a red icon specific to broken HTTPS connections, but the company plans to do this in several stages. The first stage, as explained today by Emily Schechter from the Chrome Security Team, begins next January, when the browser will start prepending the phrase "Not secure" to the page's URL (see image below). "In following releases, we will continue to extend HTTP warnings, for example, by labelling HTTP pages as 'not secure' in Incognito mode, where users may have higher expectations of privacy," Schechter explains. "Eventually, we plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that we use for broken HTTPS." Current Chrome versions don't use any kind of indicator to highlight that the user is navigating via an insecure HTTP connection that transfers data in cleartext. Google: HTTPS usage has gone up HTTP connections are considered insecure in the eyes of many security experts and companies, but there are a lot of users who don't pay special attention if the site they're navigating uses HTTP or HTTPS. Google's groundbreaking decision comes to educate users about the dangers of HTTP connections that are susceptible to MitM attacks, among many things. Data sent through HTTP connections, such as passwords or payment details, can be easily intercepted by a person on the same network. Google has been pushing for sites to use HTTPS. Mozilla has been doing the same thing, through its Let's Encrypt project that provides free TSL certificates for website owners so they can implement HTTPS for their services. Google says that, according to Chrome telemetry, around half of the web pages loaded in its browser on a daily basis are via HTTPS.

Google wants its next big business, enterprise services, to be just as all-encompassing and unavoidable. That’s the primary motivation behind its move, announced this morning, to acquire Apigee, a company that went public last year, for $625 million. Put simply, Apigee builds software tools that let non-tech companies create the kind of tech they couldn’t on their own. If Burberry, an Apigee customer, wanted to use an app for retail or customer services, it would turn to Apigee. With Apigee in tow, Google would have another point of entry to reach corporate clients, something it has made a big effort to do since hiring Diane Greene, its enterprise SVP, back in November. Initial reactions by sources in the industry applauded the deal as smart (and thrifty) for Google, although Google’s enterprise arm faces stiff competition from Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce. We spoke briefly to Greene about the deal and how it fits into her nearly year-long effort to remake the search giant into a viable enterprise operation. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. For a longer discussion with Greene, check out our upcoming Code Enterprise conference, where she is among the featured speakers. Recode: You could have bought a number of enterprise companies. Why this one? Diane Greene: This is a great one. As we spend more and more time with our enterprise customers — current ones, future ones, ones in the process — the API systems come up continually. Since I’ve started, I’ve had two [customers] ask what they thought of Apigee. The partners out there are saying that getting their API strategy functioning is a key step for their business. You don’t have to wait on the phone. You just do it programmatically. It’s kind of an exploding area. As we provide the end-to-end solutions for what our customers want to do digitally, this is a big part of what they want to do in all kinds of verticals. With app engines and containers, we’ve eliminated a lot of the code needed — sort of the back end of the back end. Now we can provide the front end of that back-end service. Is this acquisition more about deepening your ties with current customers or reaching new ones? Certainly [Google and Apigee] have overlap in our customers. We also complement each other. More than anything, it makes it so clear to the enterprise of how dedicated we are in a forward-looking way. Is the entire Apigee staff coming over? Will they work under your organization? We can’t comment on that. We have to let [the deal] close. Okay. How do you see the deal fitting into what you’ve done since joining in November? We just brought this organization together — the sales and marketing. Now we’re in a position where we can go talk to an enterprise with a single face. We can partner them with our engineers. Which they love, because they’re good engineers! This just further complements and gives them all the components that they need and want. We’ve got a single team now. We’re all excited at the rate at which we’re developing functionality. Google made a serious investment in us. We’ve got a lot of work to do. But this is the biggest thing I’ve experienced. You’ve invested heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence to set the cloud operations apart. How does that fit in with the Apigee product? I don’t think we’re allowed to talk about what we can do yet. recode_divider Next Up In Google Watch a supercut of Google’s event announcing its Pixel phones, Home and Daydream VR headset Google's hardware event was really all about its AI software Liveblog of Google’s hardware event Google's hardware chief says the Pixel will hold its own against the iPhone Google tailored its fabric Daydream headset for VR first-timers Trending Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime No satire: The stars of HBO’s ‘Silicon Valley’ say they got ‘cucked’ in an LA bar News Corp, the New York Times and Axel Springer are backing Scroll, a subscription service from the former CEO of Chartbeat Marc Benioff says companies buy each other for the data, and the government isn’t doing anything about it The meeting that made Marc Benioff run away from a deal with Microsoft More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

APIs “are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace,” Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. “They’re the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it’s a small business applying online for a loan or a point-of-sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer,” she added. For example, APIs can enable a business’s computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. Apigee is used by hundreds of companies, including AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, Live Nation and Walgreens, according to Google. Adding Apigee to its team promises to raise Google’s game against major competitors Amazon and Microsoft in the market to provide businesses with services in the internet cloud. Forrester, the independent market-research company, last year predicted that annual global spending on API management would top $1 billion by 2020. “The transition toward cloud, mobile and digital interaction with customers and partners via APIs is happening, and fast,” Greene said. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulators and Apigee shareholders but is expected to be completed this year. “We’ve entered a new era of cloud computing, where enterprises are increasingly running business-critical applications in the cloud,” Apigee chief executive Chet Kapoor said in a release.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau By Julia Love and Natalie Grover | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO Alphabet Inc's Google said on Thursday it is acquiring cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million, the tech giant’s latest effort to claim a greater share of the lucrative cloud business. San Jose-based Apigee's software helps companies' digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practise of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specializes in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were slightly above the offer price at $17.43 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google's profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. "Our customer lists are extremely complimentary," she said. "There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position,” he wrote in an email. (The story was refiled to correct the description of Apigee to "cloud software company" the in headline and the first paragraph) (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Dan Grebler) Next In Technology News Facebook aims for more transparency with video ad data Two months after Facebook Inc admitted it had inflated the average time it told advertisers that users were watching their video ads, the company is promising better data to give ad buyers a clearer picture of how they are spending their money.

Finance Search Thu, Nov 17, 2016, 6:52 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 3 hrs 8 mins Google buys cloud specialty firm Apigee for $625 mnAFP – Thu, Sep 8, 2016 7:15 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Google says its new messenger's "smart" capabilities make it easier to respond to messages and over time adjust to users' own style Google on Thursday announced a deal to pay $625 million for Apigee, a firm specializing in managing the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that businesses use to connect with customers online. APIs "are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace," Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. "They're the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it's a small business applying online for a loan or a point-of-sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer," she added. For example, APIs can enable a business's computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. Apigee is used by hundreds of companies, including AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, Live Nation and Walgreens, according to Google. Adding Apigee to its team promises to raise Google's game against major competitors Amazon and Microsoft in the market to provide businesses with services in the internet cloud. Forrester, the independent market-research company, last year predicted that annual global spending on API management would top $1 billion by 2020. "The transition toward cloud, mobile and digital interaction with customers and partners via APIs is happening, and fast," Greene said. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulators and Apigee shareholders but is expected to be completed this year. "We've entered a new era of cloud computing, where enterprises are increasingly running business-critical applications in the cloud," Apigee chief executive Chet Kapoor said in a release. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » BBC World Service adds 11 languagesAAP The BBC World Service will begin broadcasting in 11 additional languages in a drive to reach millions more people, … Post boss says mail reform took too longAAP Spain ups growth forecast for 2016, 2017AFP House prices affect travel: Virgin CEOAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7483 -0.007 -0.92% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6016 -0.0049 -0.81% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7005 -0.0035 -0.50% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Socceroos Currency Converter HMAS Darwin NZ Home loans Carrie Fisher Mortgage calculator Dwayne Johnson Budget Rent a Car WGEA pay gap Free iTunes download Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Google Maps goes beyond Uber with Lyft support The navigation app now displays nine ridesharing partners as transportation across 60 countries Technology trends and news by Ronny Kerr September 8, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/471c Editor's note: Our 6th Annual Vator Splash LA conference is coming up on October 13 at the Loews Hotel in Santa Monica. Speakers include Mark Cuban (one of the hosts of Shark Tank and owner of the Dallas Mavericks); Brian Lee (Founder & CEO, Honest Company); Leura Fine (Founder & CEO, Laurel & Wolf ); Nick Green (Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Thrive Market); Tri Tran (CEO & Co-founder, Munchery); Adam Goldenberg (Founder & CEO, JustFab); Andre Haddad (CEO, Turo); Mike Jones (Founder, Science) and many more. Join us! REGISTER HERE. The Uber-Google coziness continues to unravel. Google today announced that it has added support for Uber’s primary U.S. rivals Lyft and Gett to Google Maps for Android and iOS. The feature works in the same way as other transportation options in Google Maps. For example, if you look for directions from John F. Kennedy International Airport to 5th Avenue in New York City, you'll see a variety of transportation options—car, public transportation, walking, biking—along with associated directions and estimated duration of journey. Earlier this year, the only ridesharing option you would see pop up was Uber. The app would give you an estimated duration as well as an estimate for the fare. Tapping the desired service (like “uberPOOL” or “uberX”) would then open the Uber app so you could hail the ride. In March, Google announced that it had added several additional ridesharing partners around the world. Now the company has given the user even more options by launching support for Lyft across the U.S. and Gett in New York City. A spokesperson confirmed for me that Google Maps now displays ridesharing options from nine partners in over 60 countries: Gett in the UK (and now NYC) GO-JEK in Indonesia Grab in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines Hailo in the UK and Spain Lyft in the U.S. mytaxi in Germany and Spain Ola Cabs in India Uber around the world 99Taxis in Brazil Besides offering convenience to the ordinary Google Maps user looking to compare ways to get to their destination, the new feature also allows one to compare prices between different ridesharing services. So instead of having to hop between standalone apps (say, Uber and Lyft) to see how prices compare and whether one is “surging” or not, you can simply add your destination to Google Maps and compare options there. While it's a surefire win for consumers, I can’t imagine the ridesharing vendors love this new element of competition. Ridesharing companies already battle each other over market share and often engage in price wars to lure customers. Though the timing of today’s announcement is probably coincidental, it’s worth noting that the relationship between Uber and Google has grown less amiable lately. Last week, after it emerged that Google-owned Waze would be expanding its carpooling pilot later this year, it was also announced that David Drummond had stepped down from Uber’s board of directors. Drummond serves as Google's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer, so it was clear that the increasing competitiveness between Google and Uber would undercut Drummond's ability to serve on the board objectively. Even so, Google still has a stake in Uber’s success. Drummond originally joined Uber’s board in 2013 when Google Ventures (now GV) made a $258 million investment in the ridesharing company. Ed. note: Our 6th Annual Vator Splash LA conference is coming up on October 13 at the Loews Hotel in Santa Monica.

The tool pulls data directly from the Facebook Insights and AdWords reports APIs into a single view without what Segment officials call ".csv shenanigans, futzing around with a bunch of APIs, or iterating on hacky scripts." "We started to get a lot of feedback from people struggling to understand ad spend," said Segment CEO Peter Reinhardt, co-founder of the nearly 4-year-old, 115-employee company. "They were downloading spreadsheets manually trying to make sense of how campaigns on Facebook compared to campaigns on Google." That feedback, he said, prompted the vision for today's release. Beyond Ad Click-Throughs Reinhardt said users now have the capability to measure actions beyond ad click-throughs. It's been a tough proposition for markerters until now, he said.  Ad platforms like Facebook and Google hold half of marketers' data: spend, impressions and clicks. The platforms require marketers to define a "conversion event," but, as Segment officials pointed out in a statement, a prospect's intentions and actions are "more nuanced than binary conversion." "It's possible people might not sign up or purchase something but they may do something like share a link," Reinhardt said. In other words, there is value beyond click-throughs. Too often, marketers rely on just that one metric, along with purchase data, Reinhardt said. "They can't look at the whole path, the whole funnel, the actions downstream," he said. Maybe a prospect ends up subscribing to a newsletter when originally they were targeted for an asset download. Or someone shares a product with a friend but didn’t buy it right away.  Segment combines the top-of-the-funnel data with down-funnel engagement data: app engagement, revenue, sales leads, repeat purchases. Segment allows marketers to tie ad impressions and costs to in-app behavior, new sales leads and revenue.  Specifically, the new capabilities announced today help marketers: Measure spend across Google and Facebook advertising channels in one dashboard Analyze the conversion path of people that visit through paid campaigns Prove ROI of campaigns by comparing customer acquisition cost to lifetime value Building on Momentum Facebook and Google represent the latest integration with Sources, which Segment released in April. It is designed to allow users to load data from a variety of systems including CRM, email and payments.  The Segment platform integrates with Salesforce, Zendesk, Stripe, SendGrid, MailChimp, Mandrill, Intercom, HubSpot and Twilio straight into Amazon Redshift or PostgreSQL without writing a line of code.  Today's integrations with Google AdWords and Facebook Ads fulfills what Reinhardt promised in April. Segment launched in December of 2012. It claims about 8,000 customers, including Draft Kings, IBM and New Relic. It had 80 employees in April and now has 115. This month, it announced Prashant Sridharan as its new vice president of marketing. Sridharan previously held positions at Twitter, Facebook and Amazon Web Services.  He joins recent executive hires Rick Armbrust, Segment's vice president of partnerships, formerly of Facebook, and three ex-Dropbox executives: Adriana Roche, vice president of human resources, Zhenya Loginov, vice president of success, and Thomas "Tido" Carriero, vice president of engineering.

The UC Riverside team sends approximately 2,500 volumes each month and will send over 100,000 volumes in total over the course of the project. In March, UC Riverside began making additional monthly shipments of 2,000 U.S. Federal government documents to Google for scanning as part of the UC Federal Documents Archive (FedDocArc) Project. The goal of the FedDocArc Project is to create a persistent archive of one paper and one digital copy of every US Federal Document owned by the UC Libraries. UC Riverside plans to send a total of 35,000 federal documents to be scanned for the FedDocArc project. The digital copies of both the books and the Federal documents will be deposited in the HathiTrust Digital Library. The majority of  UC Riverside’s volumes being sent for digitization are in the public domain and will be entirely viewable in in both HathiTrust and Google Books for users across the globe. Many of the volumes selected for digitization are from UC Riverside’s unique or notable collections, including the Chinese & Asian Studies collection, the  Vietnam & Southeast Asian Studies collection, and the Water Resources Collections & Archives. Riverside joins UC’s two regional library storage facilities (NRLF and SRLF), UC Berkeley, and (most recently) UC Irvine as campuses actively contributing to UC’s Google Project. Past contributors include UC San Diego, UC Santa Cruz, UC Los Angeles, UC San Francisco, and UC Davis. Since joining the Google Books Library Project in 2006, 3.8 million of the University of California Libraries’ volumes have been scanned by Google and are available for search in HathiTrust and Google Books. Approximately 700,000 of these volumes are open for public access. Thanks to the team at UC Riverside for their hard work and dedication on this project!

X Google told to disclose identity of account holder of allegedly defamatory campaign The Knowledge Academy also claimed its trademark was infringed Thu, Sep 8, 2016, 19:38 Updated: Thu, Sep 8, 2016, 19:39 Aodhan O'Faolain The Knowledge Academy wants to identify those behind the campaign in proceedings it intends to take in the UK. Photograph: Stephen Hird/Reuters         The High Court has ordered Google to disclose the identity of one of its account holders to a UK-based IT training company. The Knowledge Academy Holdings Ltd, which offers IT, human resources and management training courses to companies and the public sector, sought the order claiming its trademark has been infringed and it has been defamed in a Google Adwords campaign. The Knowledge Academy wants to identify those behind the campaign in proceedings it intends to take in the UK. To do that it needs to be provided information about the Adwords account holder from Google. Adwords is Google’s online advertising service that places advertising near the list of search results. Irish courts In order to obtain those details the Knowledge Academy needed an order from the Irish courts, because the information requested relates to services provided by Google Ireland Ltd. The information it seeks include the name, address, phone number and email addresses of the person or people responsible for the campaign which was processed by the internet service providers in or around June of 2016. The application came before Mr Justice Anthony Hunt at the High Court on Thursday. After considering submission made by the Knowledge Academy by Rossa Fanning Bl the judge said he was satisfied to grant the orders sought. Google Ireland said it was neither consenting to nor objecting to the making of the order. Competitor Mr Fanning said his client, which has no complaint against Google and was innocently all mixed up in the matter, did not know who was behind the Adwords campaign. However it believes that a competitor may be behind the campaign. Counsel said his client’s business has been damaged by the campaign. The campaign, counsel added, links the business to on line articles which the company says are defamatory and are the subject of legal correspondence with the publisher.

Google Maps Adding Lyft, Gett To List Of Ride-Hail Options Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Maps Adding Lyft, Gett To List Of Ride-Hail Options September 8, 2016 2:39 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk spoiled for choice lyft gett uber ride-hailing services transportation google google maps The next time you ask Google Maps for directions, you’ll find a few more travel options: in Google’s recently-introduced tab dedicated to ride-hailing services, Lyft and Gett fares and time estimates will also be available alongside Uber, depending on where you live. Today, the company announced that Maps will display options from “9 ride-sharing partners in over 60 countries, allowing you to compare the fastest, most affordable ride near you, without having to download and open multiple apps.” Stateside, that means Lyft will appear as an option in all the cities where it operates, and Gett results will be shown in New York City. Other newly available services around the globe include India’s Ola Cabs; Hailo in the UK and Spain; Brazil’s 99Taxis; and mytaxi in Germany and Spain. Here’s what it looks like now when I plug in the coordinates to one of my favorite destinations: Of course, if you do select one of those ride-hail options, you’ll have to have the app installed on your phone in order to actually book a ride.

Chrome Will Start Giving You A Heads’ Up If That Site You’re On Isn’t Secure Enough Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Chrome Will Start Giving You A Heads’ Up If That Site You’re On Isn’t Secure Enough September 8, 2016 2:41 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc fair warning google google chrome chrome Google is on a mission to make using the internet a safer experience for even the least techie surfers. One feature at a time, it’s been trying to highlight not just when something is safe, but when it’s not. And soon, another one of those tweaks is coming to Chrome. Google announced today that it’s changing another default in the name of making your data safer. When it comes to ordinary web surfing, of the type we’ve collectively been doing for 25 years, the default we’re used to is not the smarter one. Good old HTTP isn’t really very secure, and can pretty easily be hijacked by anyone who feels like causing trouble. That’s why HTTPS is slowly becoming the new default. In recent years, thousands if not millions of sites (including Consumerist) have switched to making HTTPS, the more secure connection, the way the site loads for everyone. So with the January change to Chrome, Google’s going to be pushing that “default” status a little bit more. Instead of just marking when a page is using HTTPS, as it currently does (look for the little green lock), Google’s going to mark visibly when it isn’t, like so: How Chrome works in the present and the future. The change won’t apply to every HTTP-using site on the web, but it will be visible when a page is transmitting payment or password information — those things you most want to keep to yourself. That’s because studies show that putting up too many warnings makes people tune them out, the Chrome team explains, so it’s starting small. Eventually, however, many months down the line, Chrome will be marking all HTTP pages as insecure. The idea is that by the time Google’s ready to start throwing up that warning, it will be uncommon enough that it really grabs users’ attention. It’s a lot like the insecure and unauthenticated icons Google started dropping into GMail early this year: treat the secure version as the “neutral” one, and draw attention when the situation is otherwise. And Chrome is now the most popular web browser, so Google’s actions have a widespread impact on users and the sites they visit.

Google announced today that the ride-sharing tab in Google Maps now supports Lyft and Gett in the U.S. Lyft will begin appearing for Google Maps users across the U.S., while Gett will start appearing for folks in New York City. With these additions, the ride-sharing tab supports nine services in more than 60 countries. The ride-sharing tab in Google Maps is meant to help you quickly compare service like Uber, Lyft, Gett, and more, showing you how far away the ride is and approximately how much you can expect to pay for a ride. This saves you time since you don’t have to open up each service’s app and compare their fares and times.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Rumor has it Huawei and Google are teaming up on a new 7-inch tablet. An earlier leak revealed that the device could pack 4GB of RAM, and a new report adds even more flagship-level hardware to the list. German site HuaweiBlog reports that the Google tablet will offer high-end specs across the board, citing anonymous insiders in China. That includes a Quad HD display, a Snapdragon 820 processor, 64GB of storage and a 13-megapixel camera. The new leak also reaffirms earlier claims that the device sports a 7-inch screen and 4GB of RAM. There’s still a lot we don’t know about the rumored tablet. The name is a particularly big mystery, especially with Google allegedly killing off the Nexus brand entirely. It seems likely the device could fall under the Pixel umbrella as a follow-up to last year’s Pixel C (pictured in the gallery up top). Google is apparently planning a big event for October 4 where we should see the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones unveiled. If the company really is working on a tablet with Huawei we’re guessing it will make an appearance at the same time, though we’d still treat this latest rumor with a grain of salt for now.

Google plans to mark all websites that don’t use HTTPS as unsafe in the future, Google Chrome’s security team writes in a blog. Starting with Chrome 56, scheduled for January 2017, the browser will show an information icon with ‘not secure’ next to the URL. Currently Chrome indicates HTTP connections with a neutral indicator. Sites that use encrypted connections over HTTPS show a green icon. According to Google the neutral indicator doesn’t properly show the lack of safety for regular HTTP websites. These sites can be modified by someone else on the network before they reach the user. A substantial portion of web traffic has transitioned to HTTPS so far, and HTTPS usage is consistently increasing. Recently Google hit a milestone with more than half of Chrome desktop page loads served over HTTPS. Because users don’t perceive the neutral indicator as a lack of security and because users become blind for warnings, Google has decided to take the new measure which it will roll out gradually. Starting with Chrome 56 all HTTP pages with password or credit card form fields will be marked as “not secure”. In following releases, Google will continue to extend HTTP warnings, for example, by labelling HTTP pages as “not secure” in Incognito mode, where users may have higher expectations of privacy. Eventually, the search giant plans to label all HTTP pages as non-secure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that is currently used for broken HTTPS.

On on hand, I don't like the amount of control Google has over the internet. Part of me wants to scream "you have no right to force other websites to do anything!" On the other hand, switching to HTTPS on all websites is not only the absolute best way to fight government wiretapping surveillance, it is also perhaps the only way prevent man-in-the-middle and man-on-the-side attacks. 0 Agree Xercus Moderator Posted on: 13 Sep 16 05:39 I despise the way they try to control the net and while this particular idea is only for the better, they continue force-feeding change for this/that, trampling on variety/privacy in the process and gain more control.

Google parent company Alphabet is teaming up with fast casual chain Chipotle to test drone delivery for Virginia Tech students, according to a report from Bloomberg. The pilot program marks a turning point for Alphabet’s Project Wing division, giving the team ample room to experiment with airborne burrito deliveries in one of the first commercial programs of its kind to be greenlit by the US Federal Aviation Authority. The drones, which will be hybrid aircraft that can both fly and hover in place, will make deliveries coordinated by a Chipotle food truck on campus. "It’s the first time that we’re actually out there delivering stuff to people who want that stuff," Project Wing head Dave Vos tells Bloomberg. Most drone delivery testing in the US has been tightly restricted by the FAA, which has often been slow-moving and prohibitive when issuing rules around unmanned aerial vehicles. In June, the FAA removed the requirement that drone pilots have a pilot’s license, but it has yet to lay out an easy pathway for companies like Google and Amazon to move forward with semi-autonomous delivery drones. Chipotle burritos delivered by flying Google robots? They're real Alphabet initially tested Project Wing in Australia, and Amazon recently launched a pilot program for its Prime Air drone delivery service in the UK. Now, after gaining approval from the White House last month, Google is ready to team up with a national restaurant chain for one of the more ambitious real-world delivery programs. Project Wing drones will be guided predominantly by software, but human pilots will be on hand to assume control if necessary. The aircraft are also prohibited from flying directly over human beings. So active participants will be shielded appropriately, according to Alphabet. Project Wing chose to partner with Chipotle because it presented unique challenges: could a drone adequately deliver food using a winch system, and can the food remain hot throughout flight with special packaging? "It sounds simple, but it’s not," said Timothy Sands, Virginia Tech’s president. "There are a lot of things to work out from a safety point of view and a policy point of view." The program will be accessible to select Virginia Tech employees and students. All parties involved stand to benefit from burrito drones All parties involved stand to gain something from the project. Because Virginia Tech is part of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, it's been chosen as of six schools to be used as a testing ground for commercial drone use. The school hopes these types of pilot programs will help it became a leader in new transportation technologies, like drone delivery. Project Wing, on the other hand, gets valuable data to help it develop a second-generation version of its aircraft and better hone its automated flight system and delivery mechanisms. (The team is one of many working with NASA to develop a state-of-the-art air traffic control system for UAVs.) The FAA will also use the data Project Wing generates to improve its commercial drone guidelines. And students? They get burritos ferried to them in the sky, a dorm room dream come true.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Google acquires API platform provider Apigee for $625M Google paid $17.40 a share for the publically traded company Financial trends and news by Steven Loeb September 8, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/4719 Application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow apps to share data and information with each other, are becoming big business. According to Forrester, companies in the U.S. alone will spend nearly $3 billion on API management by 2020.  Google, which has its own set of APIs that it offers, is looking to to bulk them up, so it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire API platform provider Apigee, it was announced on Thursday. The company is paying $17.40 per share in cash, for a total value of approximately $625 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year.  Founded in 2005, Apigee provides an API platform that can be used by companies to make their services available on multiple mobile devices and channels. On top of the platform, Apigee also provides its customers analytics to measure the activity coming from those apps. To make it clear what Apigee actually does, let's take the example of what it did for one of its biggest customers: Walgreens. Walgreens offers a photo-printing service that it wanted to add to make accessible through a mobile device. So, the company used Apigee to build an app that runs on the iPhone that allows consumers to upload their photo directly to Walgreens from their phones without having to go onto the Walgreens website first. Apigee did not build the app but it did provide a layer on top of the Walgreen's infrastructure that enabled Walgreen's engineers to make the website photo-sharing available on mobile devices. The company offers Apigee Edge, its API-management solution, as well as Apigee Insights, a big data analytics platform that helps organizations gain new business insights in the app economy; Apigee Link, which turns devices business into digital IoT platforms; and Apigee Sense, its security service. Apigee customers include 30 percent of the Fortune 100, four of the top five Global 2000 retail companies, and five of the top 10 global telecommunications companies. It is used by Burberry, Morningstar, First Data, AT&T, Bechtel, and Live Nation. "APIs — the mechanism developers use to interface and integrate with outside apps and services — are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace. They're the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it's a small business applying online for a loan or a point of sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer," Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google’s cloud business, wrote in a blog post. “The addition of Apigee’s API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers’ move to supporting their businesses with high quality digital interactions." While Apigee provides Google with a set of API tools to offer its own customers, Google gives Apigee access to more  "Many companies understand the importance of using digital technologies to transform business models and processes, but often they pursue digital and cloud independently. Not only are they trying to deliver digital experiences that are fast and convenient for their customers and partners, but their IT organizations are also shifting infrastructure to the cloud to increase agility and lower costs. Smart companies realize that these are two sides of the same coin; that digital strategy must converge with cloud strategy," Apigee CEO Chet Kapoor wrote in his own blog post.  "Apigee is proud to be a leader in APIs. We have a solid track record of working hand in hand with some of the largest and most demanding brands in the world to solve new problems and create new products. We can't wait to see how much better and faster we can be with Google." In an FAQ, Apigee says that nothing will change, at least not right now. It will "continue to operate indendently," until the transaction closes. There's no indication of what will happen to Apigee after that, though.  The Palo Alto, California-based Apigee had raised $171 million from investors that included Pine River Capital Management, Wellington Management Company, Norwest Venture Partners, Bay Partners, Third Point LLC, SAP Ventures, funds managed by BlackRock, Focus Ventures, and Accenture. Apigee was valued at $671 million when it raised $60 million in April of 2014, but it went public at a valuation of $494 million, a decrease of 26 percent.  It's stock is currently up 6.49 percent, to $17.40 a share, just above its $17 IPO price. VatorNews reached out to Apigee for more information on the future of the two companies.

Revision as of 10:06, 8 September 2016 This page lists all confirmed or suspected issues involving the CA "WoSign". It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The issues are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments 2 Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 3 Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments 6 Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments 7 Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 9 Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 10 Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 11 Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 11.1 WoSign Response 11.2 Further Comments 12 Cross Signing Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which may violate section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2016, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

Google is now adding two new partners to the US, including major competitor Lyft and smaller ride service Gett. The ride service tab appears beside the public transportation, biking, and other options when searching for directions in the Android or iOS app. Fare estimates and pick up times from multiple ride services are listed and tapping an option will take you directly to the corresponding app to book a ride. Various types of services offered by each partner, including Lyft Line or Uber Pool, are also listed. Google now has nine ride sharing partners in over 60 countries following today’s additions. Lyft ride options will soon begin appearing across the US, while Gett will show cars available in New York City. Google is rumored to be launching its only ride sharing service through Waze. After extensive testing in Israel, the service is reportedly coming to the San Francisco Bay Area this fall. In light of this and work on self-driving cars, Google and Uber’s relationship is growing increasingly contentious. Just last week, Alphabet legal chief David Drummond resigned from Uber’s board of directors over a conflict of interest.

You aren’t dreaming. This is real. My first reaction was checking the calendar (not April 1st) and then lamenting that I grew up in the wrong era. But immediately after that I began wondering if even Google is going to be able to scale this to meet demand… Thankfully for Google, and sadly for college students everywhere, the project is only a trial and will last just a month. That doesn’t mean this isn’t serious business however. The project is FAA approved and more projects like it are planned. The story, which was fed to Bloomberg (not via Drone) includes a snippet from Dave Vos, who heads Project Wing. “It’s the first time that we’re actually out there delivering stuff to people who want that stuff.” [LOL!] The burrito-bearing aircraft will be flown by automation, but human pilots will be standing by to take control if necessary to comply with FAA rules, he said. Because regulations also don’t allow drones to fly over people, participants will be shielded, according to the company. Vos said the experiment will not assess one of the major technology hurdles facing drone deliveries: creation of a low-level air-traffic system that can maintain order as the skies become more crowded with unmanned vehicles. NASA is working with Project Wing and other companies to develop the framework for such a system. Data from the tests will be provided to the FAA to help the agency develop new rules allowing deliveries, Vos said. Alphabet sees the technology as potentially creating sweeping changes to society and the economy, it said in a statement. It would not only reduce carbon emissions, but may change the way consumers shop, the company said. “Sweeping changes” to having to get off your couch when you are ***** out of your mind. I look forward to the day when I tell my kids that “when I was in college I actually had to stumble to Chipotle at 2am”.   Guides Google X View THe Guide Project Wing View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

And sure enough, the company followed through on its promise of more effective and agile content management at the customer conference which ends today. Executives introduced a number of updates from the stage including a newly designed file system, better collaboration and tool functionality in Notes and automated workflows with Relay, a product created in partnership with IBM. Deeper Integration with Google But IBM wasn't the only big partner Redwood City, Calif.-based Box shared the stage with. In an unexpected move, Box CEO Aaron Levie brought Google Cloud Platform Senior Vice President Diane Greene on stage for a fireside chat, during which the two revealed a new partnership.  Without offering specifics of when the integrations would be completed, the companies laid out a plan to integrate on multiple fronts, including Google Docs, Sheets and Slides as well as an integration which allows users to search content stored in Box with Google Springboard.  Jamie Perlman, vice president of business development and international expansion at Box, explained in a blog post announcing the partnership the driving force behind it: to continue Box’s push to become the single place for all enterprise work. “As the number of applications we use, and the amount of content we work with, continues to increase, the time spent trying to find the right version of a document, searching for the last update someone worked on or making sure everyone's on the same page, only seems to go up,” he wrote. “At Box, it's been our aim to solve this since day one. And at BoxWorks this year we've introduced an all new Box, where all of your work can come together in one place, no matter what applications you're using, who you're sharing with, or what device you're on.” One Center of Work, to Rule Them All The prospect of doing everything from the same place is an attractive one, but Box is not alone in pursuing this goal. Google also has been developing the capabilities of the Gmail Inbox since its introduction two years ago to make it a single, unique place to work from.  Microsoft has been working on this too — witness the ongoing updates and integrations within Office 365 and its renewed focus on productivity. However, Rand Wacker, vice president of enterprise products at Box, pointed out during an interview with CMSWire late last week that Google and Microsoft's solutions are limited to the platforms they're tied to. A Closer Look at What Users Get As a result of the partnership, Box will act as a third party content repository for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. It will be possible to create, open, edit and collaborate on Google Docs directly from Box, with all changes saved back to Box in real time.  The Box with Google Springboard capability offers some interesting prospects. Released earlier this summer, Springboard ties together elements of Google Apps for Work through a unified search application. At the time Prabhakar Raghavan, vice president of engineering with Google Apps explained that Springboard will uncover files located in just about any Google business app, including Google Drive, Gmail and contacts. Once the Box capability becomes available, Box users will have access to this same search capability within Box content. The partnership offers Google a much desired leg up into the enterprise world through the introduction of Box's security capabilities. Any data shared from Box over Docs would remain protected and HIPAA compliant as long as the data remains stored in Box. A Win-Win for Google and Box Nan Boden, head of global technology partners at Google offered another perspective of why the partnership made sense for both parties, “We want our customers to have flexibility in their choice of tools and to have the most productive and collaborative suite possible for their needs. In fact, several of our own customers, like Avago, Intuit, Internet2 and Whirlpool already use Box and Google together, and these integrations will contribute to a more productive and collaborative enterprise,” she wrote in a blog post. While the partnership offers clear advantages for Box in its ongoing competition with Dropbox, the move helps Google make its next step into the productivity space under the leadership of Diane Greene, who has worked hard to revamp Google’s cloud ambitions since taking the position last November. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Think of Microsoft’s New Outlook Customer Manager as Salesforce Light Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Hubspot Unveils GrowthBot, a Chatbot for Sales & Marketing Digital Customer Experience Is a Business Priority, CMSWire Survey Says Nextiva Debuts NextOS for Workplace Communication, Engagement 5 Places Where Social Collaboration Tools Help Business Processes Digital Hub Platforms Can Improve Enterprise Collaboration Microsoft Connects SharePoint Team Sites to Office 365 Groups 3 Things to Know Before You Hire Across State Lines Useful Article?

Sep 8th 2016, 6:33 PM 14,723 Views No Comments Share7 Tweet Email1 Image: Virginia Mayo THE HIGH COURT has ordered Google to disclose the identity of one of its account holder to a UK-based IT training company. The Knowledge Academy Holdings Ltd, which offers IT, human resources and management training courses to companies and the public sector, sought the order claiming its trademark has been infringed and it has been defamed in a Google Adwords campaign. The Knowledge Academy wants to identify those behind the campaign in proceedings it intends to take in the UK. To do that it needs to be provided information about the Adword account holder from Google. Adwords is Google’s online advertising service that places advertising in the list of search results. In order to obtain those details the Knowledge Academy needed an order from the Irish courts, because the information requested relates to services provided by Google Ireland Ltd. The information it seeks include the name, address. phone number and e mail addresses of the person or persons responsible for the campaign which was processed by the internet service providers in or around June of 2016. The application came before Mr Justice Anthony Hunt at the High Court today. After considering the submission made by the Knowledge Academy by Rossa Fanning BL the judge said he was satisfied to grant the orders sought. Google Ireland said it was neither consenting to nor objecting to the making of the order. Fanning said his client, which has no complaint against Google and was “innocently all mixed up in the matter”, did not know who was behind the AdWord campaign. However it believes that a competitor may be behind the campaign. Counsel said his client’s business has been damaged by the campaign. The campaign, counsel added, links the business to online articles which the company says are defamatory and are the subject of legal correspondence with the publisher.

As it enters the crowded workplace wellness industry, with its quit-smoking incentives and step challenges, Thrive intends to go beyond the usual offerings to focus on "the mental aspects of our lives, what's happening in our heads," Huffington said in an interview. "This is all something that you bring to work," she added. Huffington spent more than a decade running the Huffington Post, which she founded in 2005, but over the years her interest shifted from news to the pursuit of elusive work-life balance. In the last two years, she has published two books — "Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and "Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder" and the nap-at-work manifesto "The Sleep Revolution" — full of theories she's now spinning into her new business. Last month, she announced she was leaving her namesake site to pursue her latest venture. Thrive will officially launch Nov. 30, Huffington said. In the meantime, the company is staffing up: Rajiv Pant, a former chief technology officer at the New York Times, has come on as CTO, and Kathryn Friedrich, who spent the better part of a decade at Google and YouTube, will join next month as chief marketing officer. Both said Huffington's plea for a more humane work-life balance drew them to the organization. "I was truly stressed out. This is something I personally connected with," said Pant. "If you look at my tweets, they're about behaviour, getting enough sleep. This is the right company." Friedrich thinks Thrive can create a more positive work-life experience than even Google, considered an Eden of workplace culture. "Google tries to create a good existence for their employees. They do a fantastic job," she said. "The one thing that might be missing that Arianna wants to bring to the table are metrics. It's one thing to put all the offerings out there. It's another thing to measure the success of those things." (Google is known for studying its company culture's effects on employees' productivity and happiness.) At its core, Thrive is a corporate wellness consultancy: Companies pay Thrive-trained coaches to bestow health and wellness tips on their overworked and underperforming staffs. They can opt for online courses or in-person trainings, with sessions ranging from a couple of hours to six weeks. Huffington said that the consulting firm Accenture has already piloted trainings and that JPMorgan Chase has also signed on for a partnership. In addition to its courses, Thrive will also have a media arm, as Bloomberg reported in June. Huffington has previously said Thrive is not a media company but said in an interview that it will have "a consumer platform attached to the corporate platform that will be constantly reinforcing our message." Much like the Huffington Post, the site will rely on big names, like athletes and experts, for its content. It will also sell wellness-related products like pillows and food supplements, and Huffington hopes it will eventually become a discussion platform open to the public — something the company is working on with Medium, she said. The sell? All of this, in theory, services Thrive's clients' bottom lines. But with its entry into the corporate wellness industry, which market research firm IBISWorld values at $6 billion, Thrive is competing within an already crowded space. And Huffington — who champions digital detoxing, office napping and actually unplugging on vacation — is not alone in pushing mindfulness on companies. Many other wellness companies address both body and mind, too, offering office fitness alongside meditation. Corporate wellness budgets have ballooned as companies try to curb health insurance costs, since a healthier workforce means lower insurance costs and higher productivity. But a much-cited RAND Corporation study has called many such wellness offerings into question, finding that for all the money poured into them, they save little on health care: For every $1 spent on "lifestyle management" programs — like smoking cessation and weight-loss initiatives — companies saved just 50 cents, the study found. Huffington is confident Thrive's holistic approach will yield better results for both clients and workers, saying the Rand study "really didn't address things like stress and burnout." Thrive, she said, will rely only on "evidence-based" methods for its courses; it has hired Adam Grant, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, to study its work with Accenture. "As we get more evidence, we will be adopting and adjusting everything we are doing," said Huffington. Maybe napping at the office only works during certain times of day? Or maybe meetings are actually better when everyone has a cellphone? For now, in its own SoHo offices, Thrive plans to practice what it preaches. Meetings will be device-free. ("We have beautiful notebooks," said Huffington.) And, yes, there will be a place to nap.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close The Associated Press This Thursday, Jan. 3, 2013, photo shows Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) Google to buy software developer Apigee for $625 million By Natalie Grover and Julia Love • Reuters Sep 8, 2016 (…) The Associated Press This Thursday, Jan. 3, 2013, photo shows Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) Alphabet Inc.'s Google said on Thursday it is acquiring software developer Apigee Corp. in a deal valued at about $625 million, as it strengthens its cloud business. San Jose-based Apigee's software helps a company's back-end services interact with mobile web-based apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. Cloud computing is the growing practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were trading above the offer price at $17.45 on Thursday morning. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. The acquisition will prove helpful as Google expands its roster of enterprise clients, Greene said.

"There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." Greene has been pushing to make Google a central player in corporate computing. The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc. said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Companies including Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM Corp. are competing for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Last year, the company added the ability to view different ride-sharing services, including Uber, to the app so you don’t need to switch between different apps to get a fare estimate. Today, we’re adding two more partners in the U.S., Lyft and Gett. Now Google Maps will display options from 9 ride-sharing partners in over 60 countries, allowing you to compare the fastest, most affordable ride near you, without having to download and open multiple apps. As of today, Google has added 9 more ride-sharing partners to the list, including Lyft across the US, and Gett for those in New York City. The best part is, you don’t have to download an update to be able to start using this feature. It seems that the integration was a server-side switch which has been turned on, so the next time you start Google Maps, Lyft and Gett will join Uber as various options within the app. [Google Maps Blog] local_offer    Gett   Google   Google Maps   Lyft   Uber   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (2) stars Further Reading OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Allo gets themes, emoji suggestions, and more Google and Facebook are challenging bogus websites Google WiFi preorders launch Free Daydream Views now available stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Google has now confirmed that it shouldn’t be much longer before users are able to pay for online purchases on the web using its mobile payments service. Unsurprisingly, Chrome is going to be the first mobile browser that supports Android Pay. It’s unsurprising because of the simple fact that both Chrome and Android Pay are properties of Google. “We’re moving beyond mobile apps and bringing the simplicity and security of Android Pay onto the mobile web,” Google’s global head of payment products Pali Bhat writes in a blog post, adding that “Users will soon be able to speed through mobile checkout on Chrome using Android Pay on sites like Groupon.com, 1-800-Flowers.com and many more to come,” he added. Google has made a few Android Pay-related announcements recently, it has finally confirmed support for Chase bank and has teamed up with Uber to offer 50 percent discount on rides provided that users pay with Android Pay.

This week, as local media WKNO and The Tennessean [warning: autoplay video] report, the Nashville Metro Council voted to advance a piece of legislation that will allow Google to bring infrastructure to town… despite legal threats from the incumbents. Let’s backtrack: the last few months have been a big of a high-drama saga — at least, as far as utility infrastructure is concerned — down in Music City. When the city council first proposed the change to pole access regulations, Comcast and AT&T started throwing out every excuse under the sun for how the proposal — which they had as yet not even seen — would ruin absolutely everything. At the time, AT&T claimed that the one touch rule would disrupt its agreement with unionized workers, and claimed the FCC, not local government, was the entity that had authority over the city’s telecom infrastructure rules. Comcast, meanwhile, settled for trying to kick the can down the road, saying at the time, “we believe that the appropriate next step would be to conduct a meeting of stakeholders,” which meeting “should be accomplished prior to any proposed legislation.” Google apparently can’t come to Nashville without it; the city is mostly built on hard limestone soil that nobody can bury wires through. That means utility poles, and getting a new competitor on them means tweaking existing rules. So, a couple of weeks later, Nashville mayor Megan Barry called that bluff, and asked the stakeholders to all come together and sort things out like grown-ups. That meeting happened a couple of weeks ago, The Tennessean reports, and ended with absolutely no solution. During the meeting, Google reportedly pushed for compromise, but AT&T and Comcast sought to avoid legislation. The city council, however, apparently does not care what Comcast and AT&T think. The council voted last night in an overwhelming 32-7 majority to advance the one-touch proposition. Coucnilman Anthony Davis said of the vote that residents, who have been calling and e-mailing the council, “want a solution and they want it now.” Another council member advocated for a delay, on the (true) grounds that AT&T is certain to sue the city if the bill passes. However, WKNO reports, yet another council member, Jeremy Elrod, countered that the city “should not give in to a ‘bullying’ lawsuit.” Clearly, 31 of the other Council members agreed. According to the city’s legal procedures, the bill must pass one more vote — scheduled for Sept. 20 — for final clearance, at which point it would then go to the mayor’s desk to be signed. After that, though, the city can almost certainly expect major challenges. Metro Law director Jon Cooper told the council that based on conversations he has had with AT&T lawyers, a lawsuit is all but inevitable. “If this ordinance passes with the amendment that Google is in support of, we will be sued,” Cooper said. “I’m 100 percent sure of that.” In statements to The Tennessean, Comcast and AT&T both expressed “disappointment” with the Council’s vote, and reiterated their earlier positions. An AT&T spokesperson doubled down on the “trouble with unions” position, saying, “the ordinance is at odds with our collective bargaining agreement with the (Communications Workers of America), our joint use contract with NES and even the contract we have with Google.” A Comcast spokesperson said the vote, “sends an unfortunate message to both current and future businesses looking to invest in Nashville. Instead of the Council adopting One Touch, pole owners and attachers should agree upon standards and processes to collectively address issues.” However, at least one Council member seemed to have had enough of calls to “negotiate” that go nowhere. “The bottom line is, nobody wants this not to happen,” WKNO reports Councilwoman Sheri Weiner as saying. “But we want a comprehensive solution, and we would like it to come from the players. You can’t come and ask us for legislation and then sit down and say I’m not going to talk.” Google Fiber’s Nashville proposal clears key vote [The Tennessean] Google Fiber Goes To Final Vote In Nashville, But A Lawsuit Is Waiting [WKNO] September 8, 2016 By Kate Cox@kcoxdc gonna do it anyway google google fiber nashville comcast at&t broadband competition Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related everything but the kitchen sink Comcast, AT&T Try Again To Stall Google Fiber In Nashville By Writing Law To Slow It Down so sue us Nashville Council Adopts Law To Let Google Fiber Come To Town; AT&T Prepares To Sue party in the courtroom Comcast Joins AT&T, Sues Nashville To Slow Down Google Fiber Construction now shake hands Nashville Mayor Wants Google, Comcast, AT&T To Sit Down And Make Nice Over Fiber Plans i was here first Charter, Comcast, AT&T Really Want To Stall Chance Of Competition From Google Fiber Previous Will Peeps Worker Strike Put Easter Candy At Risk?

Should Investors Be Happy? Alphabet thinks their shares are undervalued. Should investors believe the company? Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Sep 8, 2016 at 12:06PM Alphabet employees forming the Google G. Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been on a share buyback spree this year. Throughout the first six months of the year, the technology giant has repurchased nearly $3.7 billion in shares, nearly 5.2 million shares of Class C stock. This is a relatively new phenomenon for the Mountain View, Calif., company, considering it didn't repurchase any shares in fiscal 2014 and 2013. Last year, Alphabet's board of directors had a change of heart in regard to its capital return policies and authorized nearly $5.1 billion in repurchases. In January, Alphabet doubled down and authorized an additional 514,000 shares to be added to the company's existing buyback program. It appears the company has quickly plowed through the initial authorized dollar figure by repurchasing approximately $5.5 billion in the last 1.5 fiscal years. Period 1H 2016 FY 2015 FY 2014 FY 2013 Repurchase (billions) $3.69  $1.78 -- -- Shares repurchased (millions) 5.2 2.4 -- -- Cost/share $710.19 $741.67 -- -- Data source: Alphabet financial filings.  When Alphabet announced its planned buyback, I wrote a bearish argument against the move. My aversion was mostly for historical reasons and not a reflection on Alphabet's management. On average, companies are about as irrational as the average investor when it comes to share repurchases, buying shares at the top of the market and eschewing buybacks during recessions, when valuations were historically low. In many cases, including Alphabet's, share counts continue to increase even with buybacks because of the dilutive effect of share-based compensation. Lucky for investors, Alphabet didn't take my advice into consideration, because C shares have rallied nearly 8% over the weighted average buyback price. At this point, investors should be happy Alphabet repurchased their shares. Weighted Average Share Price Current Price* Premium Over Buyback Price $720.13 $780.35 8.4% *Alphabet C Shares (GOOG) as of close of market, 9/7/16. Alphabet should continue to push higher For investors, company buybacks come down to one simple question: Did the company overpay for its own shares? So far, it seems like Alphabet did not. There are a few reasons I think Alphabet has further room to run. First, the company's core business -- Google's search, display advertising, and member websites -- are doing well. Over the first six months of 2016 Alphabet, grew Google-related revenue 19% on a year-on-year basis. Google stands to benefit from the rapid shift to digital advertising because of the growth in mobile ads. Last year, eMarketer reported that Google took in 16% of all digital display revenue. Continued ad spend away from television to digital outlets should provide tailwinds to the company's top and bottom lines. The second reason is the company's new fiscal prudence. Recent articles have described Alphabet's loss-producing other bets segments as a "mess." It seems the majority of these complaints are related to falling headcounts and a more tight-fisted approach in regard to expenses. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet, after CFO Ruth Porat took the reins, has installed fiscal discipline and "tight governance" in regard to these other bets. And that makes sense for investors. Throughout the first six months of 2016, other bets reported operating income losses of $1.6 billion, versus $13.2 billion in operating income for the Google segment. Alphabet would have had 10% higher operating profit if the company simply didn't have these other bets. This could quickly change, of course, in the event one of these bets becomes the next must-have device or technology, but it seems the company is being more prudent with these companies until a path to profitability is assured. A strong core business and increased fiscal prudence should allow Alphabet to continue to grow earnings, and its share price should follow.

San Jose-based Apigee's software helps companies' digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specializes in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were slightly above the offer price at $17.43 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google's profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. "Our customer lists are extremely complimentary," she said. "There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. "Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position," he wrote in an email.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧World News Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / World News Fri, Sep 09, 2016 - Page 6　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Tech firms increase lobby as EU gets tough Reuters, BRUSSELS US tech giants Google and Facebook are among multinationals spending more in Brussels as the European Commission eyes new business regulation after last week handing Apple a 13 billion euro (US$14.65 billion) tax demand. A new annual filing by Google to the EU’s Transparency Register showed it spent about 15 to 20 percent more on lobbying EU officials and lawmakers last year than in 2014, when it grew threefold from the year before. A review by Reuters of EU lobbying budgets of a handful of leading US firms that have been in the spotlight of European regulatory debates showed Google among the biggest spenders of all corporations, reporting a budget of 4.25 million euros to 4.50 million euros last year. That compared with 3.5 million euros to 4 million euros the year before and 1.25 million euros to 1.5 million euros in 2013. A spokesman for the company — which has been served with three sets of charges in the past two years by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager — said its 14 staff involved in lobbying in Brussels were there to provide information. “European politicians have many questions for Google and about the Internet. We’re working hard to answer those questions, helping policymakers understand our business and the opportunity for European businesses to grow online,” he said. Google’s annual Transparency Register filing, publicized on Wednesday by anti-corruption group Transparency International, appeared online coincidentally on Tuesday last week. On that day Vestager ordered Apple to pay a record US$14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland after ruling that the US firm had effectively had illegal subsidies from Dublin. The iPhone maker did not respond to a request for comment on its lobbying in Brussels, where it has been advertising since July for a new government affairs manager to “represent Apple’s position with policymakers.” Its EU declaration of spending a modest 800,000 euros to 900,000 euros last year and employing just five staff working part-time on lobbying has prompted speculation that it might have underplayed its hand — although EU officials insist that they are not influenced by high-pressure corporate lobbying. Daniel Freund from the Brussels office of Transparency International said that businesses could benefit from devoting resources to relationships with EU officials in a city where an expansion of regulatory powers for the European Commission and European Parliament in the past few years has seen Brussels start to rival Washington in numbers of professional lobbyists. “A strong lobbying presence would smooth relations with the EU institutions, establish personal relationships, prevent spats,” Freund said. “The [2009] Lisbon Treaty means more competences have shifted to Brussels and companies are waking up to this fact.” Facebook, whose WhatsApp messaging service could be affected by an upcoming reform of the EU’s telecoms rules and which also has an interest in new data protection rules, spends much less than Google — 700,000 euros to 800,000 euros last year — but is expanding its small team of people lobbying for it in Brussels. A staff that numbered just two last year is now four and a fifth person is being recruited, a spokeswoman said. “Our team has increased in size as our company has grown and as such we are currently recruiting one extra person,” she said. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1270 times.

Credit: Apigee More like this First look: Google Cloud Machine Learning soars Review: 6 machine learning clouds Opening Siri to developers should make the A.I. system smarter Video Mingis on Tech: Guns get smart, Sony does VR Google plans to acquire API management vendor Apigee in a US$625 million deal that will give the search giant secure and multilanguage API tools used by companies bringing more and more of their services online. The deal, announced Thursday, gives Google access to tools that allow company back-end systems to communicate with mobile and web apps, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's cloud business, said in a blog post. APIs are "vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace," she wrote. "They're the hubs through which companies, partners, and customers interact, whether it's a small business applying online for a loan or a point of sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer." Forrester sees a growing market for API management, with annual spending from U.S. companies quadrupling from $140 million in 2014 to $660 million in 2020. "The benefits of interacting digitally drives a large market opportunity," Greene wrote. "The transition toward cloud, mobile, and digital interaction with customers and partners via APIs is happening, and fast." Apigee bills itself as an API management and predictive analytics vendor. Its products include tools to help secure, develop, test, and publish APIs, and its "intelligent API" platform is available as a cloud or an on-premises service. Among its customers are BBC Worldwide, Walgreens, Staples, AT&T, and eBay. Google has long had a relatively strong and dynamic API set -- with more than 20 API sets in Apps for Business, for example -- but the Apigee deal helps Google manage dynamic toolsets, said Guy Creese, research vice president for collaboration and content at Gartner.  A "rapid change cadence means developers need a framework for understanding, managing and testing these ever-changing APIs," he added. "This is what Apigee brings to Google -- it’s a solution for managing API changes, whether they come from Google or other technology companies." Apigee is excited to join Google, CEO Chet Kapoor wrote in a blog post. "We have a solid track record of working hand in hand with some of the largest and most demanding brands in the world to solve new problems and create new products," he said. "We can't wait to see how much better and faster we can be with Google." The deal, for $17.40 per Apigee share in cash, is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. The companies expect the acquisition to close by the end of the year. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Sep 8, 2016, 11:57am EDT share tweet Linkedin Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Google Maps users will now have even more ways to compare transportation options. The service announced it’s added Lyft and Gett to its roster of ride-hail partners. Now users who want to compare prices and travel time between different services can do so when they toggle over to the ride-share tab in the app. Google Maps says it now displays pick-up times and fare ranges for nine ride-hail services in 60 countries. Back in March, Google announced it was giving ride-sharing its own tab alongside transit, biking, walking, and driving. Uber was integrated into Maps years ago, but more recent additions include 99Taxis in Brazil, Ola Cabs in India, Hailo in the UK and Spain, and mytaxi in Germany and Spain. Google Maps Now add to that list Lyft, which is available in the US, and Gett, which is available in the UK and New York City. Google Maps will also show different types of services, such as Lyft Line, the ride-hail company’s carpool option. While Maps will only display fare ranges rather than specific prices, it still offers users one of the best ways to compare between Uber and Lyft, which have grown largely indistinguishable. Uber had previously fought back against attempts by third-party apps to access its open software to offer price comparisons with other services. In June, Uber denied a Boston-based company called Urbanhail access to its API, sparking criticism that Uber was acting in an anti-competitive fashion.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Chrome 56: HTTP sites marked as not secure By Martin Brinkmann on September 8, 2016 in Google - Last Update:September 8, 2016 38 Google announced plans today to increase the pressure on sites not yet offering their content over secure https connections. Starting with Chrome 56 Stable, out January 2017, the company plans to list some HTTP sites as not secure in the browser. Chrome uses a neutral listing for non HTTPs sites currently. All sites, HTTP and HTTPS sites with mixed content, fall into that category. Starting with Chrome 56, some of those sites may be listed as not secure in the browser instead. Any non-HTTPS page -- and mixed content pages fall into that category -- with a password field or credit card form fields will be marked as not secure in Chrome 56. Google's plans don't end there though. The company plans to extend the warning to all non-HTTPS sites in the browser's Incognito Mode, and later on to all non-HTTPS sites displayed in the browser. The indicator's color remains gray for the time being during that transition phase. In the end, all HTTP pages are shown as not secure with a red exclamation mark and text in the browser's address bar. Some sites or pages benefit more from others. While it makes sense to enforce HTTPS usage on financial sites and sites that deal with personal information, others may not benefit from it nearly as much. There are valid arguments against enforcing HTTPS on all Internet sites. They range from increased handshake times to making it harder for users to publish sites on the Internet. Previously, all you had to do was create a HTML page and publish it. With HTTPS being enforced, you need to find a way to get a certificate for your site. This has gotten easier and cheaper thankfully thanks to Lets Encrypt. It still means that you have to understand how to generate a certificate for your site and spend time understanding the process. It seems a given that the web is moving towards HTTPS, and that HTTP or mixed content HTTPS sites will have an outlaw status one day. You are probably wondering what we have planned in regards to HTTPS. I'm testing the implementation on two test URLs and the backend currently. Getting mixed content warnings because of the newsletter form currently but that seems to be the only issue right now. You can check out one of the test pages here. Note that it shows up fine right now, but that is because the newsletter sign-up won't work on that page. Now You: What's your take on marking non HTTPS sites as not secure?

It's especially true for non tech savy people, I will have no real problem myself to generate a certificate but lot of users will be discriminated. Reply Anonymous September 8, 2016 at 7:05 pm # "and later on to all non-HTTPS sites displayed in the browser." When i read on http papers Laurel will be President, of course i need to be warned in red. Probably another idea for Mozilla. Horrified. Reply Tim September 8, 2016 at 7:52 pm # Sounds like a good idea. Basically all webpages being served over HTTPS to not only provide website authentication, but to prevent pages being modified/tampered with by third-party intermediaries before they reach the end user. And then reversing the way things currently are so that instead of people needing to look for the padlock symbol to make sure their connection is secure (which the majority of people never do anyway), it works the opposite way. Almost like whitelisting, with all connections being secure, unless you're warned otherwise. It's long overdue IMO. SSL connections should really have been the standard right from the beginning of the World Wide Web and then we wouldn't be faced with the problem rectifying it now, but I guess it's easy to say that today where the TLS overhead is minimal with todays speeds and infrastructure. Even though the computational cost of HTTPS is already negligible to the average user with today's hardware, as technology moves on and the web moves to HTTP/2, encryption will be even faster than conventional non-secure HTTP connections anyway (as demonstrated on the http://www.httpvshttps.com/ test site). They need to move on to making end-to-end secure email the de facto standard next.

That's an argument against the hijacking of it. Without HTTPS, malware wouldn't even need to install the local decrypting proxy. It only does so because it can normally read only unencrypted traffic. Parker Lewis September 8, 2016 at 11:36 pm # I don't have an all encompassing view on the topic, so I can only try and guess stuff. Short term consequence: Because certificate authorities' servers can't handle the huge increase in OCSP load fast enough, browser will fallback way more often to less secure mechanisms more vulnerable to attacks. Medium term consequence: More servers could implement OCSP must-staple, increasing security. Short-lived certificates may become the norm. Forcing HTTPS on everyone everywhere is only really good if you also force OCSP must-staple at the same time, IMHO, *and* make short-lived certificate mandatory. Both measures instead of just one because when HTTPS is ubiquitous, everyone will be actively trying to find loopholes to abuse... Reply Dan September 9, 2016 at 12:04 am # Dick move by Google. I don't need HTTPS for my personal webpages. The NSA will not do MITM attacks against visitors to my page to see pics of my desktop or anime. Google, you're being evil again. Reply anon September 9, 2016 at 1:00 am # You're completely missing the point. Currently, HTTP sites are marked as neutral, which is incorrect because they offer no security at all. This change fixes that by marking HTTP sites as not secure and getting rid of the "neutral" label. Reply Dan September 9, 2016 at 6:18 am # HTTP has always been neutral. Not secure, not compromised. It's silly and heavy handed for Google to flag plain HTTP as "OMG INSECURE SECURITY RISK!". anon September 9, 2016 at 12:30 pm # Mozilla will do it too. And no, HTTP is never neutral, it is always insecure by definition. Tim September 9, 2016 at 5:28 am # It's not about the NSA or about protecting you, it's about protecting the people who visit your site. Although HTTPS prevents MITM traffic snooping, it's more than that. If all websites were HTTPS, it would provide a way for people to know that the websites they were viewing (such as yours) were the actual websites they were supposed to be and also that intermediaries aren't intercepting and modifying/injecting the pages that the end user is requesting. I don't think most users would notice if the hotel, airport or McDonalds Wi-Fi they think they're connected to was modifying the pages they were viewing. Without HTTPS the website owner and the end user would be completely oblivious to it. In addition, with the way the web is at the moment, it's left to users to remember to check for a padlock, which is just plain idiocy. I hope the owner of gHacks doesn't mind me using this website as an mock example, but would you notice that the page in the below pic had been modified before it got to you if it wasn't made so deliberately obvious? Would you notice that the URL in the address bar wasn't pointing to the real IP address? That's what this is about. http://s17.postimg.io/pkngfn1j1/image.png Reply Dan September 9, 2016 at 6:26 am # I understand the thrust of the article, I even understand the motives that Google may have considered, but that is still overkill. MITM is MITM. It is not just traffic snooping. It is also tampering en route, which is what the rest of your post is saying. And I still think it is overkill. I post my desktop screenshots. I post things about anime. My visitors (basically my wife and friends) won't care if the traffic is being snooped by the NSA, nor are they important targets for tampering. Google is not my net nanny, nor should they be allowed to act like one. Stick to flagging malware sites and hacked websites. The bulk of the worldwide web will still function with HTTP and don't need to be flagged as "DANGER INSECURE CONNECTION". And I'm saying this as an EFF supporter, a big Edward Snowden fan, and has taken network security and cryptography training. I understand the arguments quite well. Martin Brinkmann September 9, 2016 at 6:30 am # Agreed. With HTTP, there is a theoretical chance that data is manipulated or recorded, and that is obviously bad. I don't know how big of a chance that is, I suppose a higher probability in some regions than in others but overall it is probably pretty low. All Things Firefox September 9, 2016 at 7:27 am # HTTPS is important for any website because traffic injecting can cause harm to other websites. See China's attack on Github. "And I'm saying this as an EFF supporter" Towards the end of this post https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/china-uses-unencrypted-websites-to-hijack-browsers-in-github-attack is this sentence: "Sysadmins can deploy HTTPS, making it harder for malicious agents to modify traffic in-transit." If the Baidu analytics code had been encrypted it would have been harder. However, the EFF does admit that the Chinese government could force Baidu to facilitate the attack even so. The lesson does apply outside of China though. Any non-HTTPS website can be "hacked", not by modifying the website itself but by modifying the connection. Also, Google is offering plenty of time to migrate. Maybe in the future, hosters will generate certificates automatically. This doesn't help current sites though. I would not be surprised at all if Let's Encrypt or an equivalent program develops a point-and-click way of upgrading to HTTPS.

Yes, https / ssl / tls all of these are supposed to be for good and for your protection (remember heart bleed?), BUT what if there is a catch? It can be used by mega corporations against you - all users! If interested I'm able to give you many examples and facts. For an example in all modern web browsers very .... very useful and DEFAULT and hidden mega popular feature is "safe web browsing". Soooo, safe web browsing, reporting / blocking suspicious web sites - for that reason and for good intentions all is fully automated and that means whatever you type in address bar, whatever site, links you are visiting - everything is sent in real time to Google Servers to analyze http requests, carefully process, store data and identifying and profiling you and of course only with good intensions and your data and privacy all for charity in other hands relying on just someone good will - you are secure, you are safe and your private data is stored in secured place. So you have a clues what is really hiding behind good intentions and aggressive Google like corps practice and actions. Dear user, You must trust in mega and giga corps and think that you are safe, but you are not safe and you have been tricked again and again.

I'm sure no hosting provider, large and small, will want to be left behind, so nobody will be discriminated. 2. Widespread HTTPS adoption will also enable transition to HTTP/2 (only supported over TLS by browsers) so web performance will actually increase. Reply Martin Brinkmann September 11, 2016 at 11:06 am # I'm sure hosting providers will support this. Some may offer it for free, others for an extra. But enforcing https limits the Web in other areas. I can publish a HTML page currently on my own computer and make it available. Once HTTPS is enforced, that page shows up as insecure unless I somehow manage to get a certificate for that self-hosted site. I understand that self-hosting is often not suitable for offering permanent information or services, but if you just start out, this may be all you need. Reply Guest703 September 12, 2016 at 7:01 pm # About darn time somebody did something about the current state of the Internet. I was shocked in 2010 when I learned the huge prevalence of http over https, even on webpages that were *supposed* to be secure (logins, etc.) My shock has turned into despair and disgust, as even companies, let alone individuals, refuse to implement https on their websites. My dream is that one day the entire web will be https, and no web browsers will allow a connection to an unsecured page (probably not gonna happen, but one can dream right?)

The deal, announced Thursday, gives Google access to tools that allow company back-end systems to communicate with mobile and web apps, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's cloud business, said in a blog post. APIs are "vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace," she wrote. "They're the hubs through which companies, partners, and customers interact, whether it's a small business applying online for a loan or a point of sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer." Forrester sees a growing market for API management, with annual spending from U.S. companies quadrupling from $140 million in 2014 to $660 million in 2020. "The benefits of interacting digitally drives a large market opportunity," Greene wrote. "The transition toward cloud, mobile, and digital interaction with customers and partners via APIs is happening, and fast." Apigee bills itself as an API management and predictive analytics vendor. Its products include tools to help secure, develop, test, and publish APIs, and its "intelligent API" platform is available as a cloud or an on-premises service. Among its customers are BBC Worldwide, Walgreens, Staples, AT&T, and eBay. Google has long had a relatively strong and dynamic API set -- with more than 20 API sets in Apps for Business, for example -- but the Apigee deal helps Google manage dynamic toolsets, said Guy Creese, research vice president for collaboration and content at Gartner. A "rapid change cadence means developers need a framework for understanding, managing and testing these ever-changing APIs," he added. "This is what Apigee brings to Google -- it’s a solution for managing API changes, whether they come from Google or other technology companies." Apigee is excited to join Google, CEO Chet Kapoor wrote in a blog post. "We have a solid track record of working hand in hand with some of the largest and most demanding brands in the world to solve new problems and create new products," he said. "We can't wait to see how much better and faster we can be with Google." The deal, for $17.40 per Apigee share in cash, is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. The companies expect the acquisition to close by the end of the year.

Chris Hall8 September 2016Tablets Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The original Nexus 7, released in 2012 and updated in 2013, has always been one of our favourite Nexus devices. It was that convenient smaller tablet, a pure-Android almost pocketable tablet for fun and frivolity. The Nexus programme has flung out a range of tablets, the pixel-popping Nexus 10, the 4:3 Nexus 9 and that hybrid Pixel C, a tablet that wants to be your workmate.  There have been some gems in there, some breakthroughs, but there's definitely a gap in the pure Android small tablet market. So when rumours appeared suggesting a new Nexus 7, we allowed ourselves to get a little bit excited.  Here's the story on the next Nexus 7 so far.  Nexus 7 (2016): Huawei steps up In the early days of the Nexus/Pixel smartphone rumour cycle, there was one odd detail that stood out.  While everyone was talking about HTC making the next Google smartphones, a throwaway line from Charlene Munilall, general manager of Huawei's consumer business in South Africa, put Huawei in the frame. "We're doing the Nexus again this year, by the way," said Munilall. That expression was originally thought to refer to a repeat of the Nexus 6P, but might have actually been about a new Nexus 7 tablet. That line of thought came back into focus, following a tweet from leaker extraordinaire, Evan Blass. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 The @evleaks account has often proved to be entirely accurate, adding real weight to this rumour of a new Huawei-built Nexus tablet.  Nexus 7 (2016): What will it be called? That's a good question. Huawei filed a trademark on the name Nexus 7P, in April 2016. Reported by Phandroid, it very obviously ties the a new larger device into the Nexus 6P smartphone that the company produced in 2015 – which was a great Nexus Phone. So the Nexus 7P logically sits in the frame, but with a huge amount of debate ranging around the names of the next Google smartphones – currently thought to be the Pixel and Pixel XL, there's a chance that the Nexus brand will be entirely dropped. So that might leave us with Pixel 7 or Pixel 7P. Currently we don't know, based on the small number of leaks we've seen so far. Google Nexus vs Google Pixel: What's the difference?  Nexus 7 (2016): Hardware and specs We've already seen that the new Huawei device might come with 4GB of RAM from Evan Blass, a good start.  Beyond that, a set of specifications has surfaced on Huawei Blog. The readout of these runs down as follows: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB RAM, 64GB of internal storage.  That makes for a tablet that's fully-loaded, potentially offering the same sort of power as a flagship smartphone. There's no mention of battery capacity, or of the connection type. However, with Google switching to USB Type-C on the Pixel C, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, it would be irregular for a new Nexus 7 to use anything else. That would also suggest Quick Charge 3.0 support, but we have no indication of the battery capacity. We'd hope for something like 5100mAh, like the recently announced Huawei MediaPad M3. One thing not mentioned so far is a fingerprint scanner. That's been a feature of recent Nexus devices, but we have no idea how Google would implement that on a new Tablet – the Pixel C, famously, didn't have one. Pocket-lint Nexus 7 (2016): Display The same source at Huawei Blog suggests a 7-inch device with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. That's sounds pretty convincing, although that's a straight down the line 16:9 aspect. While that's great on a smartphone we can't help feeling that the slightly taller 2560 x 1600 might be used instead as it's slightly better for tablets. We have no evidence for this, however. Nexus 7 (2016): Cameras Cameras don't matter much on a tablet – we refuse to accept that it's socially acceptable to take your tablet to the zoo or theatre and snap photos with it – but there's the suggestion that there will be a 13-megapixel camera on the rear. The front camera is more useful, as this is your key to video chats and so on and we're sure it will be 8-megapixels, because that's what Huawei tends to use on its devices. Nexus 7 (2016): Release date The current thinking is that Google is planning a mega dump on 4 October where it will unleash a collection of devices – the Pixel, Pixel XL, 4K Chromecast and Daydream VR. So far there's been little mention of a new tablet, but it may well fall into the same event. Other than that, the only timeframe we have is before the end of 2016. Nexus 7 (2016): Conclusions The emergence of a new Nexus 7 on the rumour scene is relatively recent. There's long been talk of the fun that Google and Huawei had on the Nexus 6P and a belief that new device was in the works from the pair. The core specs rumoured so far look entirely typical, but there's still a question mark over what this device might be called and whether it's going to be bundled in with the rest of Google's end of year launches. One thing is certain though: with a tablet market that's got a little boring, it would be nice to have a small format Android tablet to shake things up and rival the iPad mini. We will continue to update as we learn more.

Toggle navigation FEATURES PRICING BLOG LOG IN FREE SIGN UP  NavigateArchiveFeed Archive RSS How to use Google Cloud’s Free Structured Logging Service With Golang I had a conversation with an early user of BugReplay some months ago, who had a problem with our software. ‘I’m getting “Failed to attach to the network logging of the debugger” when trying to record.’ There’s a brief moment of panic when you hear this kind of thing as a developer. That error message is supposed to be a failsafe when earlier error checking didn’t catch an issue. It’s an error that is not supposed to happen. Luckily, we had spent a good deal of time at BugReplay setting up logging for specifically this reason. I checked Google’s log console, punched in a few filters - structpayload.EventName=’ExtensionError’ - and I found logs relevant to the problem. I dug into the stack trace and found the message that the browser had reported: “The extensions gallery cannot be scripted” and the url that the error had occured on: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions. Google’s logging service is awesome. It’s one of those services that brings me actual joy to use because it solves problems for me. I’ve tracked down root causes of problems, analyzed performance, and seen how users are using (or not using) the web site. You get searchable and readable logs via a pretty good web interface, as well as extensive API access. The best part of Google’s logging service is the first class structured logging support. The JSON objects you send are fully searchable by field; and Google even analyzes the log entries as they come in so will auto-complete for you: You can type err and if you have logs that define a property that matches err* it will display something like ‘event.metaInfo.errorInfo.errorName’  and you just click it. You can find entries with that field present, or missing, or equal to a specific value. There’s a million other features of the service that I haven’t dug into yet. Because it’s logging to a central location, we’re able to keep our client side and server side logs in the same place, then view them together or separately, and because we’re logging to a remote server, we are much more careful about what and how much we log. An API call to the service can take 200ms; so even though we execute it asynchronously it is not something we want to be hammering on. For server side errors, we spawn a goroutine to send over the log entry. For our client side errors, in our catch blocks we JSONify the exception to capture the stack trace and relevant metadata (what url the error occured on, etc) then hit an API endpoint which in turn hits the logging API endpoint. Since we’ve started using structured logs, we’ve focused more on logging metadata: ids, urls, client ids. Knowing that we can retrieve things by those fields (say, give me any errors that have occurred on this url in the past week) encourages better practice, and discourages leaving extraneous logs (console.log(“lolwtfbbq”) ). Since it is structured we aren’t really crafting log lines in isolation. For most things we log we have an ‘event’ object with a name which indicates what we are actually logging (‘UserCreate’ for example), then we’ll attach metadata to it. In practice, this ends up looking something like e := events.NewUserCreate(r, user). This leads us to a more consistent form than if we were just doing a log.Printf(“A new user was created from the URL %s, their id is %s, their team id is %s”,url,id,teamID). The Go library for Google’s logging platform is unfortunately lacking on examples though the  docs for other languages are more complete. Also unfortunate, the Go library is mostly auto-generated so it is not particularly user friendly. I struggled through trying to guess at why it wasn’t working from looking at the web API, looking at assorted stackoverflow questions, gave up and came back to it a few times, then finally cobbled together a working library. The result is clonable here. If you’re not on a mobile device it is also pasted below. As for the “Failed to attach to the network logging of the debugger” bug, the next version of BugReplay’s extension had Chrome’s extension gallery page added to its preflight check blacklist, so now it correctly shows that the extension is not usable on the current page. Notes: The repo here (or docs here) have example usage for GCE and Appengine. It will also work from outside of Google’s cloud services as long as you have an account. The logsID is whatever you want to call your log, google will add it to a drop down on the page the first time you use it. 2 months ago  Share It Tweet It Pin It   © BugReplay 2016•

Through Google Chrome, users can now get their notifications pushed to them on top of active windows. While this isn’t for everybody (it is Google+, of course), this should prove useful for those who actively use the social network and want to quickly respond to any new mentions or post notifications. To activate this functionality, simply head to Google+ through the Chrome browser. It seems that Google is currently showing a message on-screen for all users allowing them to enable notifications with a single click. From there, things are pretty self-explanatory. Follow the prompts to allow Google+ to push notifications, and you’ll start receiving them on your machine. This should work on Windows, Chrome OS, and macOS.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:40 PM, September 8, 2016 Updated: 7:35 AM, September 9, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO - Alphabet Inc's Google said on Thursday it is acquiring cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million, the tech giant’s latest effort to claim a greater share of the lucrative cloud business. San Jose-based Apigee's software helps companies' digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practise of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specializes in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were slightly above the offer price at $17.43 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google's profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. "Our customer lists are extremely complimentary," she said. "There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position,” he wrote in an email.   (The story was refiled to correct the description of Apigee to "cloud software company" the in headline and the first paragraph) REUTERS mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble ‘Tweaks' to property cooling measures worth exploring, say industry players World debut: Jaguar unveils all-electric I-Pace SUV With 'change in the air', PM May asks business to help on economy While India plugs black money holes, Indians find leaks What’s most worrying about the current economic climate?

In the last couple of years, the web has seen a tremendous rise in the number of websites that use encryption, which is displayed by that little green lock next to the site’s address and an extra “s” at the end of HTTP. The increase in the use of HTTPS web encryption has been part of a collective effort to improve security and privacy on the web, often under the banner of the campaign “Encrypt All The Things.” Read more: This Chrome Bug Makes It Hard to Tell If You're on the Real Facebook At the beginning of this year, Google hinted—without announcing it officially—that it was going to flag all unencrypted websites as insecure, as Motherboard reported. At the time, Parisa Tabriz, who manages Google’s security engineering team, said that Google’s intention was to “call out” websites that still were on HTTP as “unsafe.” On Thursday, Google officially announced its anti-HTTP plan. The company isn’t going to shame all unencrypted websites all at once, but start only with HTTP sites that ask users to input passwords or credit cards. These sites will be flagged as “Not secure” in the Chrome address bar. How Chrome will flag HTTP pages that ask users for passwords or credit card numbers. (Image: Google) Then, in the future—Google is not saying exactly when yet—Chrome will flag all sites that don’t use TLS encryption as “Not secure” and also display a red triangle indicator, which Chrome already uses when users go to a dangerous website. How Chrome will flag all HTTP pages in the future. (Image: Google) “We definitely do plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure eventually,” Emily Schechter, the Chrome Security product manager, told Motherboard, explaining that the company didn’t want to all of a sudden flood users with warnings. “We really wanted to be careful about it and we wanted to get it right.” Schechter explained that Google’s main worry is that displaying alerts for all HTTP sites right away would lead users to see too many warnings and, eventually, ignore them. In other words, Google wants to educate users about the risks of unencrypted websites striking the right balance and without leading them to what’s called as “warning fatigue,” a term that indicates when users get so used to warnings that they stop paying attention. “We definitely do plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure eventually.” Google also wanted to announce the change before it was implemented to give webmasters time to migrate to HTTPS and not get caught by surprise, Schechter said. While it seems like a small change, HTTPS provides multiple protections for users. Not only does it ensure that hackers and spies can’t easily intercept passwords and other sensitive data travelling on the internet, it also ensures that the site you’re looking at really is the site you want, and not an imposter. Without HTTPS, it’s trivial for a hacker sitting in the same public WiFi you’re using, or government spies, to spy on you and interfere with the sites you go to trick you into giving up sensitive information. With this move, Google is pushing for even more HTTPS adoption. And at this point, an HTTPS-only future seems inevitable. Google reported that nowadays, more than half of the sites visited by Chrome users are encrypted already.

In fact, the policy has been in place so long that it has become a fairly common SEO best practice. So, why is it in the news again today? Google has taken it upon itself to reiterate the policy, specifically warning against “unnatural” links. Unnatural links are those that are built into a widget, and automatically placed on a site unbeknownst to the site owner. Often they contain keyword rich anchor text as well, and the worst part is site owners have no control over it. Even though the site owner may be unaware they’re publishing links on their site in a black hat fashion, Google will still penalize the use of unnaturally placed links. Upon being hit with such a penalty, Google will notify site owners through Search Console. Site owners may also receive warnings if links to their site are automatically included in widgets placed on other sites. If you have a widget out on the web that link back to your site, Google recommends fixing the problem and submitting a reconsideration request. The issue can be resolved by either removing the link(s), or adding nofollow attributes to them. As an added precaution, Google recommends checking all widgets for any unnatural links. If possible, edit the widget to include a nofollow attribute, or remove the link altogether.

Search Engine Roundtable     Home Browse by Categories Browse By Dates Search » Turn Off Mobile Site [X] Close Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google To Penalize Widget Links Tactics Google To Penalize Widget Links Tactics Sep 8, 2016 • 8:20 am | (60) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next Story Google announced early this morning that they are reminding webmasters to not try to use widget links as a link building strategy. Google said "we would like to reiterate our policy on the creation of keyword-rich, hidden or low-quality links embedded in widgets that are distributed across various sites." They actually did make a stink about widget links in February 2015, so it is a reminder. But this type of warning being posted on the Google Webmaster Blog this morning will likely result in Webmasters receiving notifications of manual actions in the Google Search Console, if they are using widget links in this manner. Google explained that although "widgets can help website owners enrich the experience of their site and engage users" that there are "some widgets add links to a site that a webmaster did not editorially place and contain anchor text that the webmaster does not control." I assume Google is seeing more and more of this and is now clearly saying "they're considered a violation of Google Webmaster Guidelines." Google even posted these examples of widgets that violate the guidelines: Google said these widget links should contain a rel="nofollow" attribute on the widget links or Google said "remove the links entirely." If you are a webmaster that embeds these widgets, you should remove the widgets if they have these links or add the "add a rel="nofollow" attribute on the widget links or remove the links entirely," as well. If not, it seems like you may be getting a manual action for link schemes soon. I expect to see them within a week or so but we will see. Forum discussion at Google+. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google Testing Bolder AMP Logo In Search Results   Comments: B 09/08/2016 01:11 pm Soon or later they will penalize the Holy Vatican too for too much Ads on Mother Teresa canonization... The Truth 09/08/2016 01:21 pm While we are at it let's penalize companies that use badges to get links. Wedding Wire I am looking at you. Dr Who Knew 09/08/2016 01:24 pm Let's penalize all links, because at this point the list of how not to link is longer than the list of acceptable links. Jerry B 09/08/2016 01:46 pm Lol, this is the exact method that huge publishing companies use to rank almost instantly for anything they want. If anyone wants to find out just how blatant it actually is go look for the article on viperchill... they use exact match anchors in their footer and dominate any search result their pages touch. Billy Mays 09/08/2016 01:52 pm This conversation has gone back more than 5 years, pretty much verbatim. If this is new to you, you lack fundamental understanding of the industry because this sort of language regarding links is essentially what ALL of their link penalties are going after. It has always been the same and has never changed. The Truth 09/08/2016 02:24 pm Oh no, Google will not penalize large publishing companies. There is to much money involved, and the shareholders of those companies could get hurt. Google doesn't want to hurt the 1%. Instead they going to penalize a handful of independent developers that are trying to make little extra money on the side. WTF! Mike L 09/08/2016 02:41 pm At first I thought this was a warning before running Penguin next month. However, any large company that's been dishing out these widgets, like Godaddy, will still have millions of anchor heavy links lying around. It then leads me to believe that as widget producers get a bit more intelligent and randomise the text/anchor text in the widget that they're harder to find. The usual scare mongering in the hope it'll prevent others jumping on the bandwagon? @DigiDonDraper 09/08/2016 04:01 pm Does seem a bit like net fishing. Sure you'll catch a few of the fish you're after but also a whole load of stuff you didn't mean to catch. What about all the useful/relevant widget links? Like travel site widgets on hotel websites; or local transport update widgets on local attraction sites? Will they get penalised too? Even if they're adding useful information for the user? E.g. users would have more trust in a government transport update, rather than some 3rd party scraper using the same data. SimonTheSorcerer 09/08/2016 04:30 pm Is this 2013 (Matt Cutts "I recommend no follows on widgets")? Aren't they supposed to be doing this for a long time. Another thing, I work with online casinos, and now every one of them started forcing affiliates to use dofollow affiliate links because one of the newcomer online casinos used it to great effect. And that online casino, that started it all, which I won't name by name because I also work for them (but I don't give them dofollow links, I'm a VIP affiliate I can get away with it) has been doing it for years successfully, without any Google penalty (now they dominate gambling SERPS).... So that's also not working. #FYI Anon User 09/08/2016 05:52 pm because that industry is a spumiest, it is more likely that those tactics count for nothing and other things are driving the rankings. Anon User 09/08/2016 05:53 pm spamfest .. not spumiest :) SimonTheSorcerer 09/08/2016 06:18 pm :D I can tell you are not an affiliate blog owner. Do you even know what you are talking about? Anon User 09/08/2016 06:54 pm yeah...do you? Ammon Johns 09/08/2016 07:26 pm Another possibility for some of the folks who have commented so far: Google have tried the warnings and hand-actions, but as is the way with Google always, they have continued to work on automated, algorithmic solutions too. They perhaps now have a new solution that works, just like Panda or Penguin (both of which were once also issues people said for years Google couldn't deal with), and because it is going to hurt big time, they are giving one final warning before letting it run... steve 09/08/2016 11:21 pm Obviously not :) Never heard of the dofollow link requirement. I have seen the embedded links in non related widgets used by some of them. So this might be interesting to watch and see what happens. Paul Walker 09/09/2016 06:39 am What is link widgets ? And why it will remove to there where it is locate ? Krzysztof Furtak 09/09/2016 07:35 am Link is a link so im not suprised. Ronnie Jones 09/09/2016 08:01 am Funny thing is if you look at the article on the Googleblog there's a followed widget link by feedburner gustavo 09/09/2016 09:38 am What about social network widgets? Yify Team 09/09/2016 10:17 am You are right Ronnie... Krzysiek Deszcz 09/09/2016 11:19 am Basically Google is not a good example of following their own webmasters guidelines. vipinnayar 09/09/2016 01:24 pm They only want we follow the rules ;) Koushik Chakraborty (KC) 09/09/2016 05:14 pm Exactly. It seems to me the same. e 09/09/2016 06:40 pm how dare you use the side bar to link to internal pages on your site. you should be penalized. Jim Christian 09/09/2016 09:19 pm I've made multiple complaints to Google with companies still using this tactic. They never listen... even when you send them the proof. Rick Roller 09/09/2016 11:54 pm What a bunch of idiots and whiners we have here. This is not a new thing, people. If you didn't already know that keyword anchor text links, hidden links, including links in widgets you give away are against google's rules if they lack rel=nofollow, or that internal links to your own site are not what this is about - get a job that does not have anything to do with the Internet. You aren't competent enough to handle anything more than Liking a Facebook post. Matt G Davison 09/10/2016 07:09 am I think they more worried about the anchor text. Although that feedburner link is not a no=follow link either. e 09/10/2016 11:40 am oh LOL 32 09/10/2016 07:18 pm Yes ive seen sites using this tactic for over 2 years... still the sites in there footers rank top. Say it again in a year google.. I would suggest they cant penalize this efficiently which is why they keep feeding us this BS Rodney 09/11/2016 06:13 am Did anyone notice a big drooping in money keyword since Thursday? on 3 keywords google send me to 20 position! after I was at 3 position over a year. this is also after I have moved my site to SSL (https). Usama Mujtaba 09/11/2016 11:50 pm @TechnicalSEO:disqus What seems the same to you > that the issue is with external links or sponsored links? Andrea Pernici 09/12/2016 07:21 am "keyword-rich, hidden or low-quality links" This doesn't mean that every widget should be nofollow. If the anchor is coherent, the widget is good, the destination page is on topic there is no reason to be worried. As always is about common sense approach to what you do. Koushik Chakraborty (KC) 09/12/2016 07:54 am The issue is with External and sponsored links as well. Technically the case is: The widgets which add links to a site that you did not editorially place and contain anchor text that you don't have control... They're considered a violation of Google Webmaster Guidelines. Anon User 09/12/2016 10:31 am If you provide widgets with a followed link in it you should worry. Common sense or not. anonymous 09/12/2016 11:18 am Let's make some sidebar links for Google then they will understand. Andrea Pernici 09/12/2016 11:18 am You should worry if you are on purpose trying to fool someone...SE included. Anon User 09/12/2016 12:08 pm In the unbelievable situation that you produce widgets with a followed link where you are not doing it to gain the followed link you will still need to worry. Google will not be evaluating your morals. Ralph Slate 09/12/2016 01:09 pm I understand why Google is opposed to this - it screws up their algorithm - but I find it frustrating that Google is shifting this onto webmasters. It is in complete contradiction to the concept of the Web that we must classify links so that Google's algorithm can operate properly. They have convinced me to nofollow everything, because I can't keep up with all the things that can get your site penalized. Even beyond that, if Google has generally determined that a link is a signal of something "good", then I would expect that a widget to another site, placed freely by a webmaster, should be a pretty strong signal that this other site is something "good". People generally don't put widgets of spam on sites that they care about. Anon User 09/12/2016 01:33 pm You are not alone no following all links. It makes a lot of sense because it is not our job to do googles job. If they are too stupid to work it all out themselves then they only have themselves to blame for the ruining of the web link landscape that they base their rankings on. Google knows they have made a massive own goal here and this is the most likely reason why Penguin has still not been released. They have no clue anymore because of the mass no following of links that they themselves caused with their negative approach through punishment rather than reward. yarp 09/12/2016 03:57 pm Yeah iv exp this too! makes you think this is just all for show this anouncement. Simon 09/12/2016 06:19 pm The problem with your argument is that you're thinking like a rational site owner, rather than an SEO well-trodden in years of Google history and webmaster guidelines. What you're describing is no different to how lay site owners perceived link exchanges 5 years ago. Site A asks site B for a link exchange. If site B agrees, then that's an up-vote. The higher the 'authority' of site B, the more powerful the up-vote, as good sites don't want to link to bad sites. These were openly done to give a valid endorsement signal to Google and, when done genuinely, these were useful signals. But this falls apart because it can be gamed and Google can't tell the difference. So Google responds by banning it and hitting all instances of it with Penguin, whether a genuine endorsement or not. Which is like penalising every site that includes user reviews, because there's a possibility that reviews can be faked. Yes, it's really dumb. You can argue whether or not the webmaster guidelines make any sense 'til the cows come home, but it doesn't change the fact that if you breach them, you're likely to get penalised. Rick Roller 09/13/2016 03:02 am Your Google & link scheme history is off. Link exchanges were listed as a "don't" long before Penguin. I was doing link building as long ago as 2007 and back then we were already aware of penalties which were specific to certain types of links like blog rolls and directorites. There were even some noticeable penalties where space would be demoted for specific keywords by 30, 50 or 90 positions in the SERPS depending on how bad the links were. It has been several years and I may have the exact numbers wrong, but prior to penguin, blackhats and link builders who thought non editorial links were ok worried about "50/90" penalties or a similar nickname. Penguin was not so much a new set of rules as much as it was a better means of enforcing existing rules. It also expanded prohibited links to include links that looked organic or editorial, but we're obviously not natural based on anchor text, link types, and other patterns. That part was new. You also seem to believe that all links in widgets will be subject to a penalty even though Google said nothing like that, unless you choose to ignore the bit about "did not editorially place and contain anchor text the webmaster does not control". Ralph Slate 09/13/2016 03:27 am Isn't a widget, by definition, a bit of code that is placed on one site but is sourced from another? That is how my widget works - the user places a Javascript tag on his site, that retrieves code from my site and this code is written on the first site. In theory, I could change my code and put spam ads in the widget. That is how I changed the links to nofollow - because the widget is dynamic. But by definition, the webmaster does not control the anchor text nor did the webmaster explicitly place the link back to my site in the widget - he placed the widget on his site which merely included the links. Simon 09/13/2016 07:31 am You're talking like a well-informed SEO. Read my comment. 5+ years ago, 'links' pages were commonplace on non-spammy websites. Webmasters weren't trying to hide them or act surreptitiously. They thought this was the way you tell users and Google about sites that you endorse. Yes, they unknowingly breached webmaster guidelines and of course there were parts of the algo that dealt with links long before Penguin (my comment wasn't a chronological history of Google), but site owners were just doing what they thought made sense. And these were valid endorsement signals. Regarding your point that I believe all links in all widgets will receive a penalty, not sure where you got that from. Bored Matt Cutts 09/13/2016 08:18 am Do you use widgets? Chirag Thumar 09/13/2016 09:21 am Social Network widgets Also ? Ahmad D 09/13/2016 09:41 am even this disqus comment system using wdget-links. LOL Rick Roller 09/13/2016 11:57 am The history lesson is important. When there is so much wrong information out there about things like this, the details matter. If you are going to give a background to support what you are saying is happening now, it should be accurate. Penguin was not a response to link exchanges by hitting them all with penguin as you asserted. In fact, Penguin had little or nothing to do with link exchanges at all. Link exchanges had mostly been rendered ineffective a few years prior to that by devaluing the links or by those earlier penalties and filters that did not have cute names of animals. I have never bought that "unknowingly breached webmaster guidelines" nonsense. If one can read well enough to get the idea that such a link scheme would help a site rank high in Google, there is nothing stopping that person from reading the Link Schemes section of the guidelines. Even link sellers and people writing about link schemes back in the pre-penguin days would often warn with titles saying things like "Here is how do a link exchange without getting caught." You may not have said "all widgets will be penalized", but it generates unnecessary confusion and fear when you start with an inaccurate portrayal of how Google has handled such things by penalizing all of them, and make that the template for how you think Google will handle the current issue. I think your larger point that it is useless to argue with the guidelines is valid. Perhaps link exchanges was a bad choice of examples since exchanges were never really considered a valid endorsement. Rick Roller 09/13/2016 12:01 pm If the link is nofollowed, it is no problem as far as Google is concerned. Read the whole message rather than taking one small bit at a time and it is quite clear what Google is after here. They aren't trying to tell anyone how your site or your widgets can function, other than how links in them are handled. Rick Roller 09/13/2016 12:09 pm "They have convinced me to nofollow everything, because I can't keep up with all the things that can get your site penalized." The list is actually quite short reading. https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356 Nobody ever got penalized for adhering to the guidelines. Simon 09/14/2016 12:51 pm "You may not have said "all widgets will be penalized", but..." You do seem to like disagreeing with things I didn't say, like widget penalisation and Penguin's history. At least you agree with the thing I did say. "I have never bought that "unknowingly breached webmaster guidelines" nonsense." That's your inexperience talking. Commenters on here often believe that the 9 sites they look after are a good representation of the billion sites on the web. Or that every site owner is as clued-up as their clients. In reality, very few site owners know what SEO is. They don't research 'link-building' this or 'webmaster guidelines' that because they have no concept these terms even exist. They do link exchanges because someone emails them asking for a link exchange. The reason there used to be so many 'links' pages on sites is because site owners thought this is what you're supposed to do. If they were being deceptive, this wouldn't have been so prevalent. I talk with hundreds of business owners as part of what I do and none of them use SEOs. None of them would have ever heard of 'Google webmaster guidelines'. None of them design their own websites; they use a trusted third party web designer or company whose skills typically extend to Photoshop, HTML and almost nothing in SEM. And none of the site owners would have a clue if their web design company breached webmaster guidelines. And they often do breach guidelines either through sheer ignorance or because they're cutting corners to try to impress their client with improved rankings. That's the reality of things. Rick Roller 09/14/2016 01:44 pm Ah, I see. You are one of those bozos who claims that someone you don't know lacks experience if they say something you disagree with. Off to the idiot pile with you. Your creative cut and paste may fool other idiots, but it is clear you are just trying to avoid the fact that you just spouted pure nonsense and are too fragile to own it or clarify it if you did not mean to say that link exchanges were unpenalized before Penguin. If you honestly believe that people who are trying to make their site rank higher in Google have no idea what SEO is and have no idea what links have to do with ranking, or even that most webmasters do whatever some stranger asks them to do in an email you are truly an idiot. I don't really believe you are that stupid. You even say those people thought that that type of linking was what they were supposed to do. Where did they get that idea? Most likely they were looking up things like "how to make my site pop up in Google" and found some blogger with saying that's how it is done - not because some other webmaster asked them to do it. I can't believe anyone would claim that hundreds of webmasters had no idea what they were doing and built bad links because of email requests. What a fairy tale that is! I suspect you know better but are a blowhard who needs to feel right even when you don't know what you are talking about. Every time you publish something as incorrect as your claim that Penguin targeted link exchanges, you are doing a disservice to people who really don't know any better. Before you post, check your ego and check your facts. Ignorance is a childish excuse. If you can read how to set up webmaster tools, or read some blog post about "here's how to rank number one in Google", you should be able to read the rules. By 2013, it became nearly impossible to read anything about ranking in Google without finding plenty of information about link penalties, Penguin, and even what link schemes were already penalized. Simon 09/14/2016 02:05 pm And you're one of those deeply frustrated anonymous self-professed experts who thinks that every webmaster on the planet falls into their little bucket of thinking. Your ignorance is amusing. And please feel free to point out where I said that link exchanges were unpenalized before Penguin. Was it here: "...of course there were parts of the algo that dealt with links long before Penguin (my comment wasn't a chronological history of Google)..."? Perhaps you should try reading the comments before responding in future. Rick Roller 09/14/2016 08:33 pm You were pretty clearly claiming (incorrectly), that penguin hit all instances of link exchanges, after saying they were previously "useful" signals. It's actually two incorrect things in rolled into one, right here: "What you're describing is no different to how lay site owners perceived link exchanges 5 years ago. Site A asks site B for a link exchange. If site B agrees, then that's an up-vote. The higher the 'authority' of site B, the more powerful the up-vote, as good sites don't want to link to bad sites. These were openly done to give a valid endorsement signal to Google and, when done genuinely, these were useful signals. But this falls apart because it can be gamed and Google can't tell the difference. So Google responds by banning it and hitting all instances of it with Penguin" You later pretended you knew that was incorrect, but if I hadn't called you on it, you would have just continued babbling and misleading others in your misinformed fantasyland: that place where you know what you are talking about. So nice of you to show your hypocrisy and/or stupidity by accusing me of the very thing you have done: "...self-professed experts who thinks that every webmaster on the planet falls into their little bucket of thinking." Did you forget you already said I fell into your bucket of "inexperience" even though you have no idea what my level of experience is? Funny you mention ignorance: you say a lot, but your words show you know very little. You are only fooling the easily fooled. Simon 09/14/2016 09:02 pm R: "How dare you say links weren't penalized before Penguin and that all badges are penalized!" S: "I didn't." R: "Err... well... how dare you make me think that you said that even though you didn't! Because it's wrong!" S: "I didn't. Read the comments." R: "How dare you say links weren't penalized before Penguin!" S: "Yes, you already said that. I didn't. Read the comments." R: "Well, you're a bozo." S: "Actually, I think you might be." R: "How dare you say links weren't penalized before Penguin!" S: I do agree with you, though. I need to be more careful with what I write on here. After all, there are some idiots out there who might misread it and go and do or say something really stupid as a result. Rick Roller 09/15/2016 11:52 am You can try to pretend you didn't say the things you said, and pretend I said things I did not all you want if it makes you feel like less of a worm. You are not fooling anyone but yourself. Semidot Infotech Pvt. Ltd. 09/16/2016 12:13 pm We use widgets for enhancing our motives and people are making it for spreading link building which is not good.

So when I saw pictures at Google with the 18th birthday balloons and such floating around, I was confused. I first spotted it on Instagram a week ago, which was August and Google never celebrated their birthday in August. It seems like Google was just preparing the social media posts for their upcoming big 18th birthday. Google posted on Twitter yesterday "Did you know we're celebrating our company's 18th birthday this month? #itsmybirthday #partylikeits1998" With the same framed picture from that Instagram version. Here is another one, completely different on Instagram. I suspect the 18th birthday celebration will be a big one at Google. This post is part of our daily Search Photo of the Day column, where we find fun and interesting photos related to the search industry and share them with our readers.

No worries, Google is now aware of the issue and promises a fix will be out within 24 hours or so. Google said on Twitter that there is a workaround, just clear your cookies or try accessing the report using incognito browser: Update: If you see errors accessing realtime reports in GA, a temporary workaround is to clear cookies or use an incognito browser window.— Google Analytics (@googleanalytics) September 8, 2016 Google also said the fix should be out soon: We are working on a permanent resolution to this issue, which is expected to go live tomorrow. Apologies for the inconvenience.— Google Analytics (@googleanalytics) September 8, 2016 So be patient or try those workarounds to get your real time reports. There is another bug I didn't mention yesterday around Google Analytics, this one is about setting up scheduled emailed reports within the Dashboard section. They simply error out and don't let you schedule an email report to be set up, if you try to do them in your personalized dashboard in Google Analytics. Here is a thread about that bug at the Google Analytics Help forum. Here is a screen shot of that bug: Forum discussion at Twitter.

TheSocialMarketers 09/08/2016 11:54 am For us this serves as an excellent reminder on how much we've come to rely on real time intelligence in any form of marketing.

Daniel Aleksandersen 09/08/2016 10:30 pm Matches my experiences from here in Norway (English language Google). I’ve tried with different web browsers and devices too. I guess we’ll just have to wait for Google to fix it. I find it a bit weird that they don’t show a snapshot of “recent activity” when real-time data is unavailable. Doesn’t look like they ever expected that it could fail in this manner. Mr Telco 09/08/2016 10:33 pm You'd think google would have a website error nipped in the bag?

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Google Pixel XL Rumored to be Telstra Exclusive Down Under; New Call and Text Plans Revealed By Lee Mijares Sep 7, 2016 | 10:10 PM Aside from dropping the name Nexus on its HTC-manufactured phones, Google is rumored to be going back to basics when it comes to choosing its mobile carriers. According to a report from Ausdroid, the largest mobile carrier in Australia, Telstra, will be chosen as its exclusive carrier for at least one Google's new Pixel phones. Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 unpopular because of their mobile carriers? Telstra is indeed Australia's biggest mobile carrier. However, reports say that this move by Google could be worrisome. To recall, Google has experimented with several other mobile carriers, especially with their Nexus labeled phones that did not fare well in the market. This deal would mean that only Telstra customers will be allowed to purchase the phones. Customers who do not use Telstra may only be able to purchase unblocked Pixel XL phones. Unblocked Pixel XL phones are not recommended since these may not be from Google. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The last time Google made an exclusive carrier access to their Nexus phones in the US did not work well. The tech company ended up giving other carriers the go signal to sell their Nexus 5X and 6P phones. Calls and text plans for the Pixel XL Telstra was able to get the Nexus 5X in 2015 but was not able to market the 6P. Codenamed Marlin, the Pixel XL will be marketed full force by Telstra with a list of plans for calls and text for customers. Pre-orders for the Pixel XL will start on October 4 while the carrier announced that it will officially launch on the 20<sup>th. At this time, Telstra customers will be able to avail the Pixel XL with its 6GB data complete with unlimited calls and text for only $95 AUS a month. More information about other plans for talk and text will soon be announced by Telstra. Pixel and Pixel XL launch Reports said that the Pixel and the Pixel XL will be launched early October and it looks like Google is pushing for an October 4 launch date. There are also rumors that Google will also launch a new Huawei Nexus 7 processor. The two phones will have identical aesthetics and the only difference is the screen size with the Pixel having 5 in and the XL with 5.5 inches. The two will have QHD AMOLED screens, Qualcomm Snapdragon 521 processors, 32GB or 128 GB storage and 4GB RAM. There will be a dual 12MP and 8MP camera while the XL will have better camera specs. The Pixel and the Pixel XL will both come with the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system with new features such as split-screen, better security, support for Vulkan API, and improved night modes. With the Nougat 7.0 upgrade, the two phones will be able to use Google's Android-powered VR platform called Daydream.

San Jose-based Apigee's software helps a company's backend services interact with mobile and web-based apps used by customers and partners. "Companies are moving beyond the traditional ways of communicating like phone calls and visits and instead are communicating programmatically through APIs (Application Programming Interface)," said Dianne Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share held, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were trading above the offer price at $17.45 on Thursday morning. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. This is the latest from the highly regarded enterprise computing executive Greene, who is pushing to make Google a central player in corporate computing. The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Companies including Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp are competing for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Sep 8, 2016 at 10:21AM Image source: Getty Images. There are plenty of reasons to think that virtual reality (VR) has finally arrived. Facebook's Oculus finally launched its virtual reality headset this year, Sony (NYSE:SNE) is about to do the same, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is about to debut a mobile virtual reality content hub (more on that later) and NVIDIA recently blurred the lines between a VR-ready notebook and a desktop VR system with its new graphics cards. But with all of its gains so far this year, there is still one major hurdle virtual reality has to overcome: Its cost. A high-end VR computer can easily cost $1,000. And many high-end computers aren't VR-ready at all. In fact, NVIDIA says 99% of computers on the market this year can't handle the high-end specs you'll need for a true virtual reality experience. If you want to build your own VR computer, you'll need to shell out at least a couple hundred dollars (on the low end) just for the graphics card alone, not to mention the rest of the computer's internals. And then there are the headset costs. A high-end headset like HTC's Vive or the Oculus Rift will run you $599 and $799, respectively.  At the present costs, a VR fan will have to shell out at least $1,600 for a high-end virtual reality experience. Those costs will likely stymie VR's growth in the high-end market. But it's not all bad news. The best VR experience is going to cost a lot of money for a while. But really good VR experiences, at much lower costs, should be the real VR growth driver in the short term. In the coming weeks, Google will release a Daydream VR platform, according to Bloomberg. The platform will be a way for mobile users to access VR videos, apps, and other content. It'll be the first VR content hub of its kind and I think it's going to be one of the most significant ways that virtual reality is adopted by consumers.  Google isn't just launching a hub for VR content -- it is also paying some content creators up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to make videos for Daydream, and is partnering with device makers to ensure that smartphones will be ready to handle all the content the platform offers.  Of course, Google isn't the only one pursuing cheaper alternatives to VR. Sony will release its own VR bundle next month (which includes a VR headset, games, and controllers) that all work with its PlayStation 4, for just $499. Or, you can get the headset for just $399. That's not cheap, of course, but 40 million PS4 consoles have already been sold and transitioning those console users to VR users can be done with just a $399 headset. So Google should help drive inexpensive mobile VR growth and Sony will help VR growth among console users. Meanwhile, high-end devices should continue to see their prices drop as more people get interested in the technology. Research firm Tractica says that the price of VR headsets should decline by about 15% each year over the coming years. And that drop in price will help spur growth in hardware sales and VR content, which is expected to have a combined market value of $21.8 billion by 2020, up from just $108.8 million in 2014.   So while virtual reality may still be too costly for many consumers, there are plenty of upcoming hardware and software offerings in the pipeline that should spur VR growth and drive down costs. Mobile VR will be much cheaper than Oculus' headset, and Sony's headset will fall somewhere in between. With such a large VR market on the horizon and key tech companies making VR a priority it won't be long before investors see this promising technology turning into big gains.

Apigee’s mission has been to build a company that powers the APIs and delivers the know-how to help enterprises navigate a new kind of business reality and operate as modern digital businesses in a multi-cloud world. Many companies understand the importance of using digital technologies to transform business models and processes, but often they pursue digital and cloud independently. Not only are they trying to deliver digital experiences that are fast and convenient for their customers and partners, but their IT organizations are also shifting infrastructure to the cloud to increase agility and lower costs. Smart companies realize that these are two sides of the same coin; that digital strategy must converge with cloud strategy. Apigee is proud to be a leader in APIs. We have a solid track record of working hand in hand with some of the largest and most demanding brands in the world to solve new problems and create new products. We can't wait to see how much better and faster we can be with Google. We're grateful to the hundreds of customers and thousands of developers who use Apigee. Working together so closely has helped us deeply understand your needs and we are humbled by what we learn from you. We look forward to partnering with you for many years to come. Building a company requires having a point of view and more importantly, executing on it consistently. This would not have been possible without the passion and hard work of all Apigeeks past and present. Thank you, Apigeeks. We’re excited to accelerate our journey to connect the world through APIs as part of the Google team.   About the Transaction Apigee® (NASDAQ: APIC), today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which Google will acquire Apigee for $17.40 per share in cash, for a total value of approximately $625 million.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google has agreed to pay $17.40 a share in cash, San Jose, California-based Apigee said in a statement Thursday. That’s a 6.5 percent premium to Apigee’s closing price Wednesday. The companies expect the deal to be completed by the end of the year. Apigee sells a platform that aids companies in managing their APIs, which are programming tools that help developers build software that talks to each other and shares information without revealing the underlying code. APIs have become an integral part of cloud software development, allowing one application to pull data and use services from multiple other programs.  “The addition of Apigee’s API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers’ move to supporting their businesses with high quality digital interactions,” Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google’s cloud business, said in a blog post, referring to application program interface products. Apigee counts among its customers Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., AT&T Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Burberry Group Plc. Walgreens uses Apigee to offer APIs and analyze how the tools are being used. Developers, for instance, can easily incorporate a feature into their apps that allows users to print photos at any Walgreens store, Greene said.

Greene joined Google late last year to lead the effort and has focused on broadening Google’s tool set to attract less technically savvy customers. The Apigee acquisition will also help support Google’s own set of APIs, which include ones that allow developers to pull information from YouTube as well as the Translate and Maps software to imbed in their own apps. “They’re looking for assets to build out their cloud business,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Clearly this fits into that area and they are looking for specific niches where they can really differentiate themselves.” Google declined less than 1 percent to $802.84 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 3.2 percent this year. Apigee jumped 6.6 percent to $17.41. Lazard Ltd. was financial adviser to Google in the deal. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Google Risks $7.4 Billion Fine for Violating Antitrust Regulations in the EU GO Google must respond to charges until September 20 Sep 8, 2016 13:56 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Back in April, the EU competition enforcer accused Google of demanding mobile phone makers to pre-install Google Search and Google Chrome browser on smartphones so that they would get access to Google apps. Reuters reported that the EU competition enforcer have Google until September 20 to respond to charges brought back in April. Then, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections against Google's practices. It seems the Commission was displeased with the fact that the Mountain View-based company required smartphone manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google Chrome browser, as well as set Google Search as the default search service on handsets so that they could later use Google proprietary apps. In addition, the company prevented manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing OS based on Android open source code. Google even went so far as to give financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators so that they could exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices. Google was fined for violating antitrust regulations earlier this month Kent Walker, SVP and general counsel at Google, told TechCrunch at the time that “we look forward to working with the European Commission to demonstrate that Android is good for competition and good for consumers.” He also stressed that “anyone can use Android without Google,” an example in this regard being Amazon. Google was initially given a deadline of July 27 to respond to charges, but the company requested an extension until September 7. The EC provided Google with an extension until September 20. Google is risking a $7.4 billion fine or 10% of its global turnover. Earlier this month, Google was fined $6.75 million over Android antitrust violations. The claim made by Russian company Yandex was roughly the same, with the company accusing Google of requiring smartphone and tablet manufacturers to install Search, Maps, and other services as part of the Play Store package. However, the company is risking a much bigger fine from the EC unless it can provide a response to satisfy the Commission on September 20. #Google#Google Search#Google Chrome#Yandex#Antitrust Laws subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Russia Fines Google $6.75 Million over Pre-Installed Android Apps Google Addresses EU Antitrust Charges for the First Time: We’re Not Perfect Privacy App Slaps Google with EU Antitrust Complaint EU Telecoms Join Forces Against WhatsApp, Skype - Reuters Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Photo: Guelda Voien Nominally, South Korea is very much up to speed. Antecedent in the areas of fashion and WiFi accessibility, it’s easy to assume that everything else is just as modern. I’m guilty of this assumption. On my fourth day in the peninsular country last week, I decided to venture out on my own—away from the galleries and museums where each viewing and interview was groomed and polished for a western journalist—and find some fried chicken. There was a well-reviewed establishment within walking distance of my hotel, so I consulted the service Americans generally do for directions: Google Maps. Alas, Google told me I couldn’t reach my destination on foot. Funny, I thought. Is it somehow confused, perhaps thinking I’m still in New York City? Stupid thing. I found the restaurant on my own. Later, I concluded another meal at a tony gallery, not far from the so-called Blue House, the nation’s presidential residence. I had walked there and knew it to be a quick jaunt from my hotel. I again consulted Google and was again told there was no way to navigate home. I asked one of my South Korean hosts what was up; she quickly dismissed the strange results and suggested trying another service. Turns out whip-fast internet doesn’t mean an unimpeded one. As others have pointed out, and I should have known, the South Korean government regulates the internet with a concerning zeal. Not only is pornography illegal, but the government also routinely deletes comments on social media, according to a 2014 report from the Economist. The story notes that a law is still on the books preventing South Korean maps from being taken out of the country (a precaution to keep North Korea from having detailed information on its southern neighbor). That rule has been interpreted, a cursory Google search reveals, to include any server data located in another country, which Google’s is. This is a long way of saying that it makes sense that the bulk of the artwork on view at the Gwangju Biennale, which began September 2 in the southern city of the same name, has a political bent. Asia’s pre-eminent biennale, now in its 11th year, is not only held at the site of the Korean government’s notorious 1980 massacre of left-leaning students (and eventually civilians)—it is an ongoing source of reflection in a country that apparently needs it. Let’s back it up, though. For those not familiar with the Gwangju uprising, sometimes called simply “5.18,” here are the facts as I can best construct them: In 1980, a group of students protesting President Chun Doo-hwan’s seizure of power (he was later “elected”) and use of martial law were beaten, shot and killed by paratroopers sent from Seoul. Gwangju residents came to the students’ rescue and effectively, shockingly, held the city for nine days. They were sure the American government would notice their plight and intervene, given the U.S.’ close ties with the South Korean power structure, according to a report by the Korean Resource Center, a nonprofit advocacy group based in California. The U.S. never showed. The government for years insisted that the uprising was led by communists, and even banned the music associated with the student protest movement. Doo-hwan was later sentenced to death for his role in the massacre but was pardoned. Estimates of how many people died vary. A Korean newspaper says 165 people perished, while the Wikipedia page for the uprising says 606. A prominent Seoul gallerist told me “thousands of people” died in the conflict, which is now seen as a key moment in Korea’s democratization. The Gwangju Biennale is a result of the protracted “sorry” the government has given the city in the form of a bounty of funding for cultural projects, the gallerist said, over a glass of wine. In addition to the Biennale, which attracts international visitors, the city boasts the Asia Cultural Center, which opened in 2013, and a host of other cultural events. This year’s Biennale, the first under the stewardship of imported Artistic Director Maria Lind, appeared frenetically assembled. While each of five galleries in the main hall—an architectural feat that drops you onto a mountain path at the top floor—allegedly holds to a theme, I could not easily parse those associations. In the end, that didn’t matter. The show could be enjoyed in an experiential fashion, without reading about or knowing who, exactly, made each work. Political work, after all, has a way of explaining itself. Such a format will not suit everyone. Art lovers often like, perhaps even need, context, and a lack of exposition on the provenance of each work, while liberating to some, may be frustrating for others. The show’s title “The Eighth Climate: What Does Art Do?”—a rather broad, abstract query that will alienate some—was supposedly inspired by a 12th-century philosopher. Thankfully that connection, too, was not made very clear. Still, many of the 252 works by 101 artists on display stood on their own or in relation somehow, despite the lack of universal cohesion. The absence of a unifying thread may have been purposeful: Lind called the 2016 Biennale “radically heterogeneous” at a press conference. Video art took the center stage, with one gallery on the top floor entirely dedicated to media works, including Jeamin Cha’s engrossing Fog and Smoke, which follows a fisherman driving a tractor through the last remnants of old Incheon. That gallery was arranged after “the Soviet constructivists and how they showed art,” according to Lind. While the choice made for a whimsical walk through video art, the gallery was too dark to navigate easily, and some visitors stumbled over parts of the installations. That was just one way in which cracks in the organizational composition of the show were evident. Installation was still underway during the preview, and some works were not set to be completed until well into the next week, it was rumored. Air conditioning did not reach the top level, and the sultry Korean summer wilted viewers. But at the same time, the feeling that I’m far from the carefully appointed white walls of global city galleries, seeing art I’d probably never see there, is worth it. Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s video and still photo work Earshot (2016) is a standout. The Lebanese-born artist plays an audio transcript of a murder trial in Israel over images of the audio ballistic analysis of the gunfire used in the killings. Hamdan’s work in the Forensic Architecture agency at Goldsmiths College in London centers on silence, recording and the nature of speech. The questions he raised with the investigation/work were later used in U.S. congressional testimony about whether Israeli soldiers had violated the U.S.-Israel arms agreements, according to the Biennale literature. The work is informative, profound and restrained. Earshot, by Lawrence Abu Hamdan. Photo: Courtesy the Gwangju Biennale Other pieces are even more explicitly political, such as Indo K-Work, an ongoing piece that consists solely of research into the patterns of Indonesian migrants working in Korea, by Julia Sarisetiati, and the mixed-media works Drift; Root 01 and Drift; Root 03 by Inseon Park, which look at the lives of physical structures that are slowly being destroyed by the human pursuit of convenience. And other works dealt in issues lateral to politics, such as identity and performativity. Berlin duo Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz presented three film works among an installation of related items that feel as though they guide the viewer from film to film. To Valerie Solonas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of their Desperation (2013) is about as feminist as titles get. The sound and film piece (one character is the 16 mm camera, according to the artists) reinterprets a 1970 work inspired by the book SCUM Manifesto, written by Solanas (best known for shooting Andy Warhol in 1968). The clever cinematography is all the more impressive as the film is just one long shot. Opaque, a film from Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz, in their installation at the 2016 Gwangju Biennale. Photo: Courtesy the Gwangju Biennale. Some pieces strove for political import but came up lacking. David Maljkovic’s Out of Projection, a five-year project that brought Peugot’s factory workers into the French auto maker’s research department—where they had not been welcome before—lost its impact outside the context of French classism. An accompanying assemblage of video pieces and abstract sculpture failed to elucidate the project, which came off as somehow both inscrutable and condescending. Meanwhile, Teeth, Gums, Machines, Future, Society, a video work by Lili Reynaud-Dewar, was a puzzling documentary about the importance of the grill mouthpiece in African-American culture. Interviews with African-American men about their tooth adornments are intercut with what looks like network news B-roll of some of Memphis’ most neglected neighborhoods. The effect is lazy ethnography, at best. In choosing Lind, a Swede, as director, the Biennale president said he was consciously moving away from “grandiosity.” Lind, too, distanced herself from the art world’s impulse toward the spectacular, saying she selected work that looked at, among other things, how the “booming art market” has effected how art is funded. She also aimed to honor Gwangju’s history, with the tertiary programming in and around the Biennale—such as curated walks through the city with, say, a local carpenter, and Teatime with the Biennale, where people tell curators what they want from the event—forming a “stronger connection to the city” than in the past. “I don’t think spectacle is often interesting,” Lind said. In this way, the Biennale moved away from art fair mode, wherein what photographs well is often what’s talked about. Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian’s Group 9. Photo: Courtesy the Gwangju Biennale. Indeed, one gallery was peppered with the relatively small folded three-dimensional paint and steel pieces of Rana Begum and the shiny metal mirror and wood wall sculptures of Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmian. The pieces were mounted on the wall but placed in and amongst the other larger works. The curatorial choice highlighted each smaller piece, resisting our impulse to categorize and compare similar works by the same artist. Nokdu Bookstore for the living and the dead. Photo: Guelda Voien The centerpiece commissioned work was a full-scale reconstruction of a bookstore called Nokdu Bookstore for the living and the dead by Dora Garcia. The faithful reproduction of the meeting place where “the Gwangju uprising 5.18 was incubated and hatched,” was tastefully stocked with current left classics such as Dispute Plan to Prevent Luxury Constitution and Abolish Work. The books were also for sale. The graceful, simple work made its point effortlessly: The thoughts, places and people this event shattered should not be forgotten, and their work is not done. The Biennale is up until November 6 at the Gwangju Biennale Exhibition Hall in Gwangju, South Korea.

(This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: [https://crt.sh/?id=30741722 1], [https://crt.sh/?id=30741724 2], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773614 3], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773616 4], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773644 5].   For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: [https://crt.sh/?id=30741722 1], [https://crt.sh/?id=30741724 2], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773614 3], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773616 4], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773644 5].     − Secondly , the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to [https://crt.sh/?q=6d8665951cf6d8743200393a1085e0f6eb226270cc1f1402507d61faae93256a ID 109149], where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour. + Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a [https://crt.sh/?id=11900532 SHA-256 cert] with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the [https://crt.sh/?id=30773528 backdated SHA-1 cert]. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com ([https://crt.sh/?id=30773634 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=15425430 SHA-256]) and mail.gd.gov.cn ([https://crt.sh/?id=12356371 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=12362293 SHA-256]).   −   + − Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a [https://crt.sh/?id=11900532 SHA-256 cert] with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the [https://crt.sh/?id=30773528 backdated SHA-1 cert]. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com ([https://crt.sh/?id=30773634 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=15425430 SHA-256]) and mail.gd.gov.cn ([https://crt.sh/?id=12356371 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=12362293 SHA-256]).   +       Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks.   Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks.

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which may violate section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2016, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

Here’s why 0 Do those travel search results look fishy? Here’s why 0 Seth Kugel 6:00 a.m. Thursday, Sept. 8, 2016 Atlanta Travel 0 Famished after a two-leg, cross-country flight rife with delays and scarce on nutrition, I tapped open Google Maps on my phone and scanned the area around my Los Angeles International airport hotel for some place interesting to eat. At the get-go, two white circles with fork-and-knife symbols appeared: McDonald’s and Denny’s. Not for me. I typed in “restaurants,” and a few red circles with similar symbols appeared — like Carl’s Jr. and a hotel cocktail bar. Pass. Mariscos Moni (“Simple shack for seafood and Mexican grub”) sounded promising but was closed. OK, I wasn’t in Koreatown or Silver Lake, but was this the best Los Angeles could do? Only after zooming in, block by block, did some tiny red dots appear, representing Thai, Somali and Greek spots. And then Melo Burger, an “old-school, 24/7 burger stand.” Bingo. But why had chains popped up first? Isn’t my smartphone supposed to know me better than that? Could they have paid for exposure? Had an algorithm gone awry? As travelers, we’re ever more dependent on apps and online services that show us what to eat or where to sleep. Yet we (or at least I) often forget those sites are not public utilities that exist to make us happy but for-profit businesses trying to make a buck. I decided to look at four food-finding apps with maps — Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor and the much-improved MapQuest, each of which produced wildly different results for that area around LAX. I also looked at the websites of some big players in hotel searches: Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor again. The goal: to examine if companies can pay to gain visibility. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, as long as it’s transparent. The food side was more straightforward. All four companies said there was no direct way for restaurants to pay for higher visibility in their listings or on their maps, except through clearly marked advertisements. A Google spokesman, Joe Osborne, was unequivocal: Search results “have nothing to do with any sort of commercial relationship.” So why McDonald’s? In short: It’s the algorithm, stupid. Or in this case: It’s the stupid algorithm. Google doesn’t share many details about its search results, but it shares enough. “Local results are based primarily on relevance, distance and prominence,” reads a support page called “Improve your local ranking on Google.” Review scores play a role, but brands “that are familiar to many people are also likely to be prominent in local search results.” Congratulations, McDonald’s. Sorry, Banadir Somali Restaurant. MapQuest also said businesses cannot pay for a boost. Its clean, attractive results are a mash-up of more than 40 data sources. Yelp and TripAdvisor base their choices largely or entirely on user reviews and also said it was impossible for businesses to pay to raise their visibility. But restaurants can influence their success with customers indirectly by paying for what Yelp calls an “enhanced profile” and TripAdvisor a “business listing.” Such companies don’t appear higher; they appear better. In Yelp’s case, improvements include a photo slideshow, the elimination of competitor ads from their profile page and the capacity to insert “call-to-action” buttons — to print a coupon, for example. Despite similar setups, Yelp and TripAdvisor searches yield different results. Darnell Holloway, a spokesman for Yelp, said the site cultivates community participation, leading to more reviews by locals than you might find on TripAdvisor. Which is better? That’s up to you. An adventurous visitor to Taipei might use Yelp to seek local favorites; less daring types might prefer TripAdvisor reviews written by travelers with similar tastes — even filtering for English-speaking family groups (or solo Russians). Lodging sites were far more complicated. When you plug in a destination and dates on Booking.com and Expedia, the order of results is largely determined by how frequently customers reserve a particular property once they’ve clicked on it, the “conversion” rate. Whether that is beneficial to the consumer is up for debate. It is definitely beneficial to Booking and Expedia, which would prefer closing the sale before you try another site (or take a nap). But hotels can also pay, one way or another, to nudge their way up the list. Even as a frequent Booking.com customer, I had never noticed that a yellow “thumbs up” symbol appears next to many top listings. Users might think that indicates an objective seal of approval. But it actually means that the hotel participates in the “Preferred Property Program,” through which it pays Booking a higher commission rate in exchange for being bumped ahead of all or most nonparticipants. If users somehow think to hover the cursor over the symbol (in the website version), they get a semi-explanation that does not reveal that hotels pay for this privilege. Booking.com notes that hotels in this category must meet certain minimum standards, including solid review scores and few customer complaints. But I find this questionable. Exhibit A: In my searches on Booking.com for New York City, the Hotel Pennsylvania came up consistently in the top five. When I sorted hotels by user ratings, it came up 381st of 383 in the city. It does, however, have a thumbs up. Leslie Cafferty, a spokeswoman for Booking, attributed Hotel Pennsylvania’s high visibility to its excellent conversion rate. Expedia also allows hotels to pay a higher commission in exchange for better placement in search results. Sarah Gavin, a spokeswoman, said hotels tend to use that when they have rooms to fill. Hotels can also appeal to customers with daily deals, perks and the like. In general, those seem transparent and useful. But Expedia will also “dim” hotels that do not offer the company their best prices by, for instance, eliminating photos from its profile. They say that’s rare; Cafferty said Booking avoids the practice. Luckily, users can escape some of the manipulation by personalizing results, sorting by review score or price and applying filters. One last thing: Google Maps and Yelp and their competitors show just about every restaurant that’s out there, whether it’s a paying partner or not. But most lodging sites are incomplete: For example, hotels and inns not willing to fork over a hefty commission on bookings won’t be listed. Some innkeepers and independent hoteliers have told me it’s a small price to pay for exposure. But others opt out. You won’t see two of my favorite lodgings — Bowen Farm Bed & Breakfast in Stanton, Kentucky, or Friendly Bike Guest House in Portland, Oregon — on either Booking or Expedia. Their customers find them through other means: word-of-mouth or old-fashioned news coverage. Or, notably, TripAdvisor, which is unique among sites I use in allowing hotels to be listed and reviewed even if you can’t book via the site, a legacy of when TripAdvisor didn’t offer bookings. One point for them. Well, three-quarters of a point. If you click on the Bowen Farm or Friendly Bike pages, TripAdvisor nudges you toward reserving somewhere else. (Unlike Booking and Expedia, the only place hotels can pay for a boost in search results is in a slot marked “sponsored,” a spokesman said.) Bottom line: The pickiest among us (those who strive to find that homey Kentucky inn or local Los Angeles burger joint) need to be more diligent. For the rest, Yelp and Booking and the like are miracles of convenience and will usually lead you to pretty good choices, especially if you keep in mind that their bottom line is always the bottom line.

For now, the device is being dubbed the Nexus 7P, but that will likely change since Google has decided to launch its upcoming HTC-build phone under the Pixel brand. As for the Nexus 7P, rumored specs indicate that the tablet will have a 7-inch QHD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. If that wasn’t enough, the tablet is also fair to have a 13-megapixel camera around back. While Huawei doesn’t currently have a 7-inch tablet in its lineup, the company released the MediaPad M3 at IFA last week. The device is jam-packed with an incredible spec sheet which includes an 8.4-ionch QHD display, the company’s own Kirin 950 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a fingerprint sensor below the display and two 8-megapixel cameras mounted on the front and back of the device. The tablet may be a bit larger than the rumored Nexus 7P, but Huawei and Google may use it as the base platform for the Nexus or Pixel tablet. The Huawei MediaPad M3 is built with a unibody aluminum shell with an antenna cutout on the back, similar to the cutout found on the Nexus 6P. There’s no evidence to suggest that the Nexus 7P would sport the same design, but we do find it a bit intriguing. Do you think the Huawei MediaPad M3 is a good starting point for the upcoming Nexus or Pixel tablet? If you could design Google’s next tablet from scratch, what design feature would you throw in?

Springboard is an AI-powered digital assistant for enterprise customers Google on Wednesday announced a partnership with Box, an online file sharing and content management service for businesses, which will allow the latter to act as a third-party repository for Docs, Sheets, and Slides. The company says that Box will integrate with Google Docs and Google Springboard to deliver a "seamless experience for working and collaborating" for the enterprise customers in the cloud. The partnership will also allow users to create and collaboratively edit Google Docs directly from Box. Apart from the Docs integration, Google also confirmed that it is working to integrate Box with Google Springboard, which was announced recently and is an AI-powered digital assistant for enterprise customers offering content from Google apps. "We're also working together to integrate Box with Google Springboard, which connects people and information with Google-powered search and intelligence. Through this integration, Springboard will help users find the right information at the right time, no matter where it's hosted - in Gmail, Drive, Docs or in Box," said Nan Boden, Head of Global Technology Partners, Google in a blog post.Google announced that customers like Avago, Intuit, Internet2, and Whirlpool are already using Box and Google together. "We're excited to partner closely with Box to expand our efforts in the enterprise and transform how businesses work in the cloud.

The European Commission is giving Google two additional weeks-until September 20-to reply to the EU's charges issued against the technology giant in April. The commission has accused Google of using its Android mobile-operating system to strong-arm phone makers and telecom companies into favoring Google's search engine and browser on their devices. The EU had initially gave Google until July 27 to respond to the Android charges and then later extended that deadline to September 7 before granting this second extension.

Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Email What Are The Top Marijuana Websites On The Internet 53 By TWB on September 7, 2014 Marijuana Business News The Top Five Marijuana Websites On The Internet By Traffic Volume I have read many, many ‘top marijuana website’ lists over the years. Some are ranked by estimated revenue, some are purely subjective, and others have a combination of measurement that includes subjective and objective elements. A lot of the websites on the lists aren’t actually at the top, or near the top, of any measurable category, and I always wonder if they paid to get on the list, or if the person that made the list was just listing their favorites. This of course is fine, anyone can make their own list for any reason they see fit and I’m fine with that. But the purpose of this article is to list the top five marijuana websites on the internet by volume of traffic. When determining which websites made the list, I looked at Alexa.Com for each website’s ‘Alexa rank.’ People can say what they want about how Alexa ranks their own particular site, but the fact is Alexa is considered by most to be the industry standard when comparing one website to another. I don’t consider their numbers for one particular site to be that accurate as far as their estimation traffic. I know that from comparing their numbers to the Google Analytics numbers for my own site (which you can always see on our sidebar at anytime). However, the way Alexa.Com measures a site is the same for every site, so the rules apply equally. If I look at a website’s Alexa rank and it’s less than/greater than that of this blog, it’s safe to say that site gets less/more traffic. Other sites don’t post their Google Analytics on their sidebar, so how much actual traffic they get is tough to say. But if you look at their Alexa rank and it’s higher or lower than ours, you get an idea of how much traffic they might get. I have been asked by many marijuana sites to remove the Google stats from our sidebar for this very reason, because they tell people in the industry or in the media about their stats, and our sidebar exposes their inflated numbers. I prefer to leave the stats up for everyone to see because if someone is going to invest money into a website, or decide which website to advertise their product or service on, they should get good information. It’s better for the industry as a whole, because there are a lot of eyeballs on the industry right now, and things need to be done ethically and correctly. I don’t have anything to hide, and neither should anyone else that runs a marijuana website. I don’t have any monetary incentive to alter this list, because after all, I have made next to no money blogging up to this point, especially when you consider how much time I’ve put into it. I put in time to this website to help reform, not to line my pockets, proven by the fact that I work in a cubicle full time, which I’m sure is something my valued readers can relate to and appreciate! Something worth pointing out is how to interpret Alexa ranks. The Alexa rank is on a scale from the number one website on the planet to lower websites that get such little traffic, they don’t even return data. So for instance Google is the number one website on the internet right now, and Facebook is the number two website on the internet right now. NFL.com is the 88th top website in America, and the 638th top website on the entire internet, which demonstrates that Alexa gives one rank for the overall internet, and even breaks it down by country. Something else worth explaining is how traffic volume and Alexa rank are related as a website climbs the charts. To go from a United States rank of 8,000 to 4,000 is exponentially harder than going from 100,000 to 50,000. Just as it’s even harder to go from 100 to 50. For people that like math, I hope that made sense. For those that don’t like math, my apologies :) With no further delay, below are the top five marijuana websites according to Alexa.Com, ranked by volume of traffic as of this writing. Alexa ranks change pretty much daily, so these numbers will no doubt change as of this writing, but I’ve tracked all of these ranks almost daily for the last few years, and the same names are pretty much always on the list with varying positions on the list as traffic fluctuates. They are in order of overall rank, but also include the United States rank for those that are interested, as the order is different for United States ranking. If you find one that you think should have been on the list but isn’t, feel free to e-mail me, as it’s my desire to have this list as accurate as possible: 1. GrassCity.Com – 8,998 overall rank, 2,817 in the United States 2. Hightimes.Com – 13,943 overall rank, 4,472 in the United States 3. TheWeedBlog.Com – 15,856 overall rank, 3,859 in the United States 4. Weedmaps.Com – 17,251 overall rank, 3,325 in the United States 5. Leafly.Com – 19,460 overall rank, 4,519 in the United States Share.

Hundreds of paintings preserved at Tbilisi's Art Palace museum can now be found on the Google Cultural Institute website, which brings together collections from museums and galleries worldwide. Now included in the online collection is an exhibition of works by 20th Century modernist painter Petre Otskheli (1907-1937), whose paintings as well as biographical notes can be viewed here. Known for his collaboration with famous Georgian theatre director Kote Marjanishvili, Otskheli's modernist style and constant experimentation in painting earned him a lasting legacy in Georgian theatre design. Petre Otskheli's 1936 sketch 'Winged Painter'. Photo from Art Palace. His works were also recognised internationally. The 1939 International Exhibition of Stage Design in London granted him a gold medal posthumously, two years after he was executed by Soviet authorities during the 1937 Great Purge. The collection of the Georgian painter's works found its place among exhibits of the Google Cultural Institute through a collaboration between Google and Tbilisi's Art Palace, where the original works are displayed. As well as exploring the Otskheli exhibition, visitors to the Cultural Institute webpage can view more than a hundred separate paintings and photographs showcasing the legacy of Georgian artists including Elene Akhvlediani, Lado Gudiashvili and Sergo Kobuladze. The works were described by the Cultural Institute site as examples of "Georgian cultural inheritance and priceless treasures".

The works were described by the Cultural Institute site as examples of "Georgian cultural inheritance and priceless treasures".The paintings have been uploaded in high definition meaning viewers can get a close-up view of the piece and see finer details of colour and technique. The Google Cultural Institute aims to "bring the world's cultural heritage online" by featuring galleries and exhibits of some of the world’s most iconic cultural locations. The site offers a virtual tour of the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow, Russia, photo galleries illustrating the life of South Africa's former president Nelson Mandela and a slideshow history of the Palace of Versailles in France. The online catalogue launched in 2011 and today features more than six million items on various topics. Previously the Cultural Institute has partnered with museums and organisations from all over the world including the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel, Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy, and Museum of Polish History in Warsaw.

The company is now extending its efforts to benefit Web users across Asia with a new 26 Tbps cable linking the FASTER cable in Japan to Taiwan, which houses Google’s largest data center in the continent. Watch Live The company says that this should help Google services like Gmail, YouTube and BigQuery load more quickly for users in the region. Yan Tang, Google’s Network Resource Regional Lead for the Asia-Pacific region, noted that it “should also improve the reliability and consistency of this speedier experience, since the cable was strategically built outside of tsunami zones to help prevent network outages related to natural disasters.” Credit: Google According to the company, the speed of its latest cable is enough to allow all 23.5 million people in Taiwan to send across a selfie to people in Japan every 15 seconds, amounting to 138 billion selfies a day – hence the illustration above.

Elizabeth Mann Thursday, September 8, 2016 Brown Center Chalkboard Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print SMS More Reddit Google Stumbleupon Editor's Note: This post originally appeared on Brookings’ TechTank blog. A new back-to-school ritual seems to have taken root in technology circles, as each fall we speculate on whether (and how) education technology will transform the traditional classroom experience. I’m going to join the melee by weighing in on virtual reality’s potential. Despite a number of recent virtual reality (VR) developments, the 2016-17 school year is unlikely to be the time when VR becomes ubiquitous in classrooms across America. I’ll discuss the reasons why and reflect on the VR industry’s potential to break into the education sector. Author Elizabeth Mann Fellow - Governance Studies, Brown Center on Education Policy Several major players in the technology and education sectors are pursuing VR applications for the classroom, reigniting interest in its potential as an educational tool. Facebook acquired Oculus Rift in 2014, sparking speculation about possible educational applications. In 2014, Google introduced Google Cardboard, a low-cost ($10-15), low-tech piece of equipment that creates an immersive experience using, well, cardboard (and a smartphone). The internet giant has also developed the Google Expeditions app, which uses Google Cardboard to create VR field trips where teachers (“guides”) can take their students (“explorers”) on educational adventures. This summer, one of the major education publishers, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH), partnered with Google to create field trips on the Expeditions app aligned to HMH science and social studies curricula, complete with teacher guides, student activities, and lesson plans. BARRIERS TO ADOPTION So why am I pessimistic about whether 2016-17 will be the school year VR revolutionizes K-12 education? The first reason is perhaps the most obvious: cost. Oculus Rift headsets cost $600, which suggests its use in classrooms might be limited to free distribution by Facebook, at least until there’s enough educational content (which it currently lacks) to help districts justify this significant cost. While Google Cardboard itself is inexpensive, Best Buy advertises a Google Expeditions Kit for thirty students at $9,999. While cheaper per student ($333) than Oculus, this cost is still likely prohibitively expensive for many public schools, and large-scale investment in this tool seems unlikely absent concrete evidence that VR field trips improve student learning beyond what could otherwise be accomplished in the classroom. Related Education Five Ways Teachers Can Use Technology to Help Students Darrell M. West and Joshua Bleiberg Tuesday, May 7, 2013 Education Technology Technology and the Innovation Economy Darrell M. West Wednesday, October 19, 2011 TechTank Is virtual reality ready for school? Elizabeth Mann Thursday, September 1, 2016 The second barrier that makes an impending VR revolution unlikely is technological literacy. A 2014 RAND report defines technological literacy as “the ability to use computer-based devices, software, and networks”, where “use” refers not only to operating the relevant devices, but also to “advanced abilities to learn, analyze, explore”. Similar to gaps that open up early on in a child’s life in terms of word acquisition, on average, students from low-income households are at a disadvantage in terms of technological literacy. Low-income families on average have fewer, older, and less portable devices, and students from low-income backgrounds are more likely to use the internet for entertainment and social purposes rather than education.[1] Teachers and administrators, particularly those serving students whose technological literacy lags behind those of their wealthier peers, may be hesitant to invest in VR if it seems unlikely that this technology will enhance their students’ learning. Third, although a number of VR products are on the market, the VR industry remains immature. Michael B. Horn, co-founder of the Clayton Christenson Institute for Disruptive Innovation, argues that immature industries benefit from an initial stage of development in which all aspects of production are integrated. Once the various components are functioning smoothly, “modular products” can be sold and used individually. Horn suggests that various “edtech” innovations would benefit from concentrated development in an integrated environment—otherwise, individual products may hit the market but will not function smoothly in classrooms and schools. Related Books U Upcoming Unleashing Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Europe By Andrea Renda, Felice Simonelli, José Manuel Leceta, and Totti Könnölä 2016 Behavioral Science & Policy Edited by Craig Fox and Sim B. Sitkin 2016 G Global Health Challenges By Julio Frenk, Louise O. Fresco, Phua Kai Hong, and Pablo Kuri-Morales 2016 Without accompanying professional development or alignment to state content standards, teachers lack the tools to integrate VR into their daily classroom routines. While Google Expeditions takes a step in the right direction in its partnership with HMH, as mentioned above, the cost of this program remains a barrier to widespread implementation. In other words, the VR products currently on offer are, in large part, modular components that do not fit very well into the existing system. WHAT COMES NEXT? If we do not want to abandon the promise of VR, what comes next? One possibility is that charter networks or private schools may serve as incubators for the VR industry in education (Horn offers a template for this approach, suggesting that alternative school networks may provide the right environment for “personalized learning” technologies to develop). Schools that enjoy autonomy from the traditional education governance structure and, in turn, have more control over many aspects of students’ educational experience may offer an ideal environment to develop VR products that could eventually be incorporated into classrooms more broadly. Charter networks with track records of success that are comparable to traditional public school settings may be potential candidates. Intensive development within such a network may help VR developers refine programs that are designed for traditional classroom environments and are tailored to the demands on students, teachers, and administrators. Get daily updates from Brookings Enter Email Indeed, passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act in December 2015 means that many states are currently in transition, revising accountability systems, standards, curricula, and testing. This period of change may provide more opportunities than usual for the VR industry to work with policy makers and teachers to develop products designed for classroom use. Ultimately, it seems unlikely that VR will burst onto the scene during the 2016-17 school year, but it may be not too far off on the horizon. As with almost every other change in the U.S. education system, if it happens at all, VR integration into classrooms will happen gradually.

[1] Potentially compounding this issue, only 14 percent of low-income schools meet the Department of Education’s gold standard for broadband internet access, compared to 39 percent of affluent schools. Brown Center Chalkboard The Brown Center Chalkboard launched in January 2013 as a weekly series of new analyses of policy, research, and practice relevant to U.S. education. In July 2015, the Chalkboard was re-launched as a Brookings blog in order to offer more frequent, timely, and diverse content. Contributors to both the original paper series and current blog are committed to bringing evidence to bear on the debates around education policy in America.

Specifications and features The Samsung Tab S3, Samsung's latest flagship tablet, is said to be powered by either the Exynos 8890 chip or the Snapdragon 820 instead. It is also suggested to run on 3GB RAM, with 32GB and 64GB internal storage variants, packed within 8- and 9.7-inch models. The Samsung Tab S3 will have a 4,000 mAH battery life, and will support a Super AMOLED screen with 2080p resolution and possible 4K display capacity. Meanwhile, the Google Nexus 7 2016, said to be built by Huawei, is expected to run on either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or the NVidia Tegra X1, with 4GB RAM and a whopping 2TB internal storage capacity support. It is smaller than the Samsung Tab S3 at 7 inches Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Software and upgrades If we're talking Android, though, a Google-made device is practically unparalleled, whether it be a phone or a tablet. It is because Google, apart from basically being the OS creator, runs the purest form of Android with no bloatware whatsoever, as we can safely assume with the Nexus 7 2016. It is rumored to come with the latest Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, so that's another advantage. The Samsung Tab S3 is expected to run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, though that is not necessarily a bad thing since Google just launched the OS update nine months ago. This follows the release of the Galaxy Note 7, which runs on the same OS. It is also likely to upgrade to a waterproof build. Price and release dates The Samsung Tab S3 was largely anticipated during the Samsung event in IFA Berlin 2016, so it came as a surprise when the tablet went unmentioned during the event. Nevertheless, the Samsung flagship tablet is bound to come our way before the year ends, and may probably cost $399 and $499 for the 8- and 9-inch models, respectively.

Ericsson MediaFirst is a software-defined, media-optimised end-to-end portfolio suite for the creation, preparation, management and delivery of next generation pay-TV to any screen with an immersive TV viewing experience. The Ericsson MediaFirst TV Platform puts the future of TV viewing in the hands of consumers now, delivering intuitive services and features TV service providers can seamlessly implement and operate, enabling their customers to consume the content they want anytime, anywhere. The integration of Ericsson MediaFirst TV Platform with Android TV will provide an additional pathway to extend MediaFirst cloud-based TV services, including 4K-UHD live TV channels, video-on-demand, catch-up TV and cloud DVR to an even wider subscriber base. The partnership with Google will give operators the opportunity to benefit from Android TV’s growing presence on connected TV operating systems, without the need for additional hardware costs. Operators will be able to partner with manufacturers of Android TV devices to deliver new hardware-based functionality as well as niche over-the-top programming, or deploy additional applications within the Android operating system. Additionally, the collaboration will enable Ericsson to deliver multiple, flexible, pre-integrated set-top box solutions that support hybrid configurations for satellite, cable, terrestrial, and fixed and mobile broadband TV. “By expanding our range of set-top box options, we are giving Ericsson MediaFirst TV customers the opportunity to deliver cutting-edge, large scale video services and respond to the surge in adoption of smart devices, broadband connectivity and cloud-based delivery,” said Shiva Patibanda, Head of Business Line TV Platforms, Ericsson. “Our partnership with Google will empower operators of all sizes and resources to take control and leverage multiple monetisation and partnership opportunities offered by Android TV, enabling them to deliver experiences to their audiences that fully integrate their pay-TV services with Android TV applications and OTT services.” Ericsson ConsumerLab TV and Media research highlights that 56 per cent of consumers prefer to receive TV, Internet and mobile services from the same provider, if it saves money, and 22 per cent will do so even if it costs as much as the sum of the individual services. With the growth of IP video services, this only underlines the challenge facing operators to deliver compelling, convenient user experiences in a holistic fashion. The collaboration will allow consumers to enjoy a more seamless and integrated experience with a one-stop-shop for OTT content.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 8 September 2016 | MYT 6:01 PM Google given more time to reply to EU antitrust charge on Android More than the minimum: Google was initially given until July 27 to respond to the charges but asked for an extension to Sept 7, to which the European Commission has responded by granting an extension till Sept 20. — Reuters BRUSSELS: Alphabet's Google has been given two more weeks to counter EU antitrust charges that it uses its dominant Android mobile operating system to block competitors, the European Commission said on Sept 8.  The EU competition enforcer in April accused the US technology giant of harming consumers because of its demand that mobile phone makers pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser on their smartphones to access other Google apps.  Google was initially given until July 27 to respond to the charges but asked for an extension to Sept 7.  "On Android, the last deadline set by the Commission for Google's reply, after an extension request by Google, is Sept 20," a European Commission spokesman said in an e-mail.  Google can be fined up to US$7.4bil (RM29.89bil) or 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules.  It also faces charges of favouring its shopping service over those of rivals in Internet search results and blocking competitors in online search advertising. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Government , Technology You May Be Interested Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private India bans Zakir Naik's NGO Maybank sells entire stake in Visa Inc for RM413mil Beware of Rove beetles Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Petronas’ net profit soars on lower impairment losses, other factors Malindo Air offering one million tickets to celebrate winning award Catch Doctor-X on the all-new dimsum.my! advertisement Latest News US panel urges ban on China state firms buying US companies Dow, S&P drop as financials’ rally ebbs, tech boosts Nasdaq (Update 1) Cordlife secures enough shares to take StemLife private, ups offer price Wall St lower at the open after post-election rally Seacera unit acquires 101ha in Semenyih for RM165.1mil Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Warning!

This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is unknown but probably at least 60.   + WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less.         The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016.      The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016.    Line 233: Line 233:   These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent.   These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent.     − Firstly, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources. Here are five more examples: [https://crt.sh/?id=30741722 1], [https://crt.sh/?id=30741724 2], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773614 3], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773616 4], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773644 5]. + Firstly, around 12th May 2016, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three.   +     + Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, [https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2015/05/13/china-announces-special-three-day-september-holiday-mark-70th-anniversary-end-world a working day in China]. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date.     +     + For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: [https://crt.sh/?id=30741722 1], [https://crt.sh/?id=30741724 2], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773614 3], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773616 4], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773644 5].       Secondly, the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to [https://crt.sh/?q=6d8665951cf6d8743200393a1085e0f6eb226270cc1f1402507d61faae93256a ID 109149], where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour.   Secondly, the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to [https://crt.sh/?q=6d8665951cf6d8743200393a1085e0f6eb226270cc1f1402507d61faae93256a ID 109149], where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour. Line 239: Line 243:   Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a [https://crt.sh/?id=11900532 SHA-256 cert] with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the [https://crt.sh/?id=30773528 backdated SHA-1 cert]. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th.

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which may violate section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2016, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to ID 109149, where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour. Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

What Is Google Allo, And How Could It Revolutionise Instant Messaging? Thursday, 8 September 2016 by Graham Pierrepoint Instant messaging has erupted in a big way over the past few years, as both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have revolutionized the way in which we communicate with each other – while the days of MSN Messenger may be well behind us, the text chat format has found a new home on the smartphone, and has found simple integration with social media. While text messaging may have taken over instant messaging in its infancy, the format has since involved to take the best of both worlds and make them accessible to just about everybody, for free. While Facebook has taken advantage of WhatsApp’s rise in popularity by buying the brand, Google have remained conspicuously quiet on the IM front – at least, until now. The company have recently released Google Duo, the company’s answer to Skype and FaceTime – and they have designs on releasing a new instant messaging platform in the short term to compete with both WhatsApp and Facebook in the form of Google Allo. Allo isn’t necessarily the same kettle of fish as your run-of-the-mill instant messenger as it aims to incorporate machine learning into its programming, allowing for smart messaging, simpler conversations and the emergence of a smart assistant that will not only offer personalization and answers to questions that you will genuinely find useful, but will also enable you to search and browse Google itself without ever needing to leave the application. Such an integration will enable you to ask a question @Google – meaning that searching and chatting could become even more streamlined into one simple package. It’s a platform that will also supposedly feature a whole host of unique emojis and images that can be used to define and personalize your social experience – at least via your phone! There is no release date set for Allo as yet, but it appears to be a move for Google that could be considered rather lucrative – after all, instant messaging is now more mainstream than ever – and while the company may have been concentrating on driverless cars and even artificial intelligence, Google’s entry into the messaging market beyond their Hangouts system has been long-awaited for some time. Will Google Allo change the way we communicate with each other even further? Will it dare to pull us away from WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger? As always, we will have to wait and see. 14 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Reuters - Next Media - on September 10, 2016< > Embed Google files patent for light-sensing technology to help self-driving cars yield to police 00:45 Google has submitted a new patent as part of its self-driving car project for technology that will allow cars to yield to emergency and police vehicles.

Google detected the two men separately uploading objectionable images and reported them to New Zealand authorities, Xinhua news agency cited from a statement. The men, aged 46 and 52 year old, were sentenced to a period of home detention in a court earlier this week. Censorship compliance inspector Jon Peacock said the department was part of a worldwide network of law enforcement agencies committed to helping prevent child abuse. "We have the expertise to track down offenders who may think, quite wrongly, that they're safe in the confines of their own homes," Peacock said. The announcement came as the government said it would be establishing the country's first child sex offender register. "Children deserve to be kept safe from harm, which is why we are going to be more proactive in managing the risk of reoffending from child sex offenders," Social Development Minister Anne Tolley said in a statement on Thursday. Offenders would be required to be on the register for a term of life, 15 years or eight years depending on their offence and the sentence imposed. The register would also include offenders who moved to New Zealand after being sentenced to imprisonment for a corresponding offence or subject to registration requirements for a corresponding offence in another country. Police estimated the register would initially list about 1,750 persons in total. --IANS sm/dg Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read SBI reportedly writes off bad loans of Rs 7,016 cr; Cong rakes up issue in Parliament Everyone carrying Rs 500, 1000 notes is not black money hoarder: SC to govt Demonetisation: Property sales halve, realty resale market hits a wall UP govt will accept old Rs 500, 1000 notes for land registration till November 24: Akhilesh Yadav Demonetisation: Can India go cashless?

Join For Free Reduce testing time & get feedback faster through automation. Read the Benefits of Parallel Testing, brought to you in partnership with Sauce Labs. I was asked recently, kind of off the cuff, whether I thought that static analysis made sense for small business.  I must admit that the first response that popped into my head was a snarky one: “no, you can only reason about your code once you hit 1,000 employees.”  But I understood that the meat of the question wasn’t whether analysis should be performed but whether it was worth an investment, in terms of process and effort, but particularly in terms of tooling cost. And, since that is a perfectly reasonable question, I bit my tongue against the snark.  I gave a short answer more or less of “yes,” but it got me thinking in longer form.  And today’s post is the result of that thinking. I’d like to take you through some differences between small and large organizations.  And in looking at those differences, I will make the perhaps counter-intuitive case that small companies/groups actually stand to benefit more from an investment in static analysis tools and incorporation of the same into their software development processes. Size: Too Big to Fail? If you’re a massive enterprise, you’ve earned the ability to swing for the fences and miss.  Badly.  So badly that you trip and somehow your pants fall down, as if in a child’s cartoon.  As an example of this in action, consider such mega-whiffs as the Apple Newton, Google’s Glass, or Microsoft’s Zune.  It’s not just tech companies either.  Perhaps synonymous with the corporate flop was Ford’s Edsel.  And yet, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Ford are still scraping by. They have this luxury whereas those of us in small groups and firms really don’t.  We aren’t able to spend years and tens of millions of dollars working on a piece of software only discover that “oops, no one likes that as constituted, so we’d better do something completely different.”  We can’t gamble that way. Static analysis is built in flexibility.  If you charge out of the gate doing the right kind of static analysis from the get-go, you’ll have valuable feedback from day one.  You’ll know if you’re creating problematic dependencies, baking in anti-patterns or incurring technical debt.  These are the sorts of things that prevent you from pivoting your software as you go and learn more about your domain and customers.  If you keep them out of your software, you’re creating a badly needed hedge against spectacular, small-business-killing flops. Going to market with a dud isn’t the only way to fail, of course.  But if you keep your software free of cruft, you’ll have a much better chance of avoiding that particular fate. Skills Development Capacity Another luxury afforded to massive companies by virtue of their size and scale is the ability to offer training and career development to their people.  It’s not that small business can’t or don’t ever do this, but those dollars are going to be a lot more precious to them and harder to give up.  Enterprises often fly people to training courses, bring in firms to run boot camps, or hire quasi-permanent consultants to coach their teams.  As a smaller organization, your company is more likely to purchase Pluralsight subscriptions or find videos on youtube.  Maybe, if you’re lucky, it’ll pop for a conference. Static analysis tools offer an undercover benefit here.  They provide a whole lot of valuable feedback about rules, best practices, and goals to go after, and they do it by incenting developers to experiment and find ways to make their code compliant.  This is valuable, on the job learning that will stay with them and help up their skill set.  It’s not quite the same as hiring an experienced consultant to come in and work with them in real time, but it’s not a bad substitute, either. Architectural Specialization Another thing that I’ve observed about large organizations is that they tend to have architects.  A lot of architects.  Teams of architects.  Hierarchies of architects.  I wouldn’t be surprised if you could dig up someone, somewhere, with the title “Architecture Architect.”  Point is, these large firms tend to create intense specialization among their work forces, including having people who really, truly specialize in architecture (which is largely about dependency and complexity management). Your company probably can’t afford to have people wandering the halls, focused on nothing but the dependency structure of your code.  But arming your developers with a static analysis tool like NDepend can, once they’re practiced using it, simulate architectural specialty with a remarkable degree of effectiveness.  You don’t need to make a bunch of specialized hires to have a team that speaks intelligently about afferent coupling, cyclomatic complexity, and method cohesion. A Parting Metaphor Small businesses invest a lot in solutions that democratize the expensive.  They employ managed services solutions and they put things into the cloud because doing so allows them to scale from almost nothing to as much as they need.  Managed services companies, web hosting outfits, and cloud providers essentially offer a single payer model to the little guys out there, and the little guys can now have access to server farms and web scale, where they couldn’t have previously. That offers an interesting parallel to a static analysis tool like NDepend.  In the past, to have specialization within your walls, you would have needed to hire expensive, renowned employees or high priced consultants.  You might have needed to requisition custom analyses of your code base, done by teams of architect-level people.  Now, you can spend a few hundred dollars and have a pretty decent facsimile of all that. You can cultivate in small company or group an impressive degree of architectural expertise and understanding with a strategic investment in the right kind of tooling.  And this kind of tooling is available to all in a way that it wouldn’t have been, historically.

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which may violate section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is unknown but probably at least 60. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources. Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to ID 109149, where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour. Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

For Box, the deal represents an opportunity to broaden its suite of applications and potentially reach new customers who now use Google Docs. Box will serve as a “third-party content repository” for Google Docs, according to the announcement. Box shares jumped 2 percent on the news to $14.52 on the New York Stock Exchange, its highest price in a year. Alphabet shares were down a fraction at $807.99 on the Nasdaq. Box Chief Executive Officer Aaron Levie said in an interview that the goal was to bring “modern productivity tools” to a neutral platform where customers could integrate software and services from a variety of companies. He pointed to similar deals to integrate Microsoft’s 360 software application – which compete with Google Docs – with Box. The trend, he said, was toward “more interoperability between companies.” He praised Greene and Google for pursuing collaboration. “In the past nine months, we’ve seen huge investment in the ecosystem,” Levie said. Companies including Google, Amazon.com Inc, International Business Machines Corp and others are all racing for a piece of the next-generation corporate computing business as big companies increasingly move their computing operations to big shared data centers known as the cloud. Box, which went public early last year, offers secure products to help companies manage information in the cloud.
