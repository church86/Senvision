X Bitter battle between news media and Google steps up The internet giant, branded ‘the terrorists’ friend’, is being criticised from all quarters about 15 hours ago Laura Slattery The metadata on extremist content can be altered to deceive the Google algorithm. Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images         It is high noon in the relationship between Google and the news media. “Google, the Terrorists’ Friend”, splashed the Daily Mail on Friday, declaring below its masthead that it took “two minutes on web to find a terror manual on how to use a car for mass murder”. The accompanying picture was of murdered police constable Keith Palmer on his wedding day. The loud-and-clear message was that some of the blame for the death of Palmer and three pedestrians on Westminster Bridge lay with Google. What’s more, as well as making it possible for trainee terrorists to access “vile manuals”, Google’s YouTube platform “was found to be raking in money from conspiracy theories” that the attack in London was a “hoax”. Although internet giants such as Google and Facebook do have a case to answer when it comes to the dissemination of extremist material, this screechy front page reveals more about the Mail than it does about Google. Its headline is not merely the latest technology-induced moral panic either, but a salvo in an intra-industry war. Hate speech For perhaps the first time in its history, Google is experiencing a bit of a pile-on. The Mail’s headline comes in the midst of a genuine crisis for the company. Advertisers, and the big media agencies that buy advertising on their behalf, have pulled their campaigns from Google and YouTube because of the risk that their ads might be placed alongside hate speech. It’s something of an understatement to say it is not a good look for household-name brands to end up, through automated systems, in a corner of the internet where they are generating ad income for hate preachers. While Google has promised better safeguards and enforcement, there are still too many “gaps in the fence”, as Justin Cullen, chief digital and data officer at Dublin-based Core Media, said last week. (Core has suspended its clients’ campaigns on YouTube and the Google Display Network.) ADVERTISEMENT John McManus: Who is really the fascist? The limits to free speech in Ireland World View: Media must join resistance to hate speech Falling trust in Irish media needs to be addressed One issue is that the metadata on extremist content can be altered to deceive the Google algorithm – for example, an audio Ku Klux Klan podcast placed on YouTube may use an image file of some innocuous philosopher, masking the true nature of the content. Advertising withdrawal The great advertising withdrawal has now spread across Europe and to the US and Australia, but it started notably in the UK with a string of articles in the British press, including several investigations by the Rupert Murdoch-owned Times newspaper. Both the Daily Mail & General Trust (DMGT) and News Corp – two media groups that are no stranger to advertiser wobbles themselves – can be said to have Google firmly in their sights. The context is a digital advertising market that is increasingly dominated by Google and Facebook at the expense of content-producing media groups. Research company eMarketer has forecast that Google will make $72.7 billion (€66.9 billion) in advertising revenue in 2017, meaning it controls a whopping one-third of the digital market. Fast-growing Facebook, meanwhile, will pick up $36.3 billion. Digital is no mere sideshow to the media either. According to eMarketer’s figures, digital ads in 2017 will account for 38 per cent of worldwide advertising spend and 51 per cent of Irish advertising spend. This is the story of the big, money-sucking players versus the would-be competitors fighting for crumbs. Pointing this out is not to diminish the real concerns that advertisers have about extremist content and Google’s systems – quite the opposite. Rape memes Four years ago, some advertisers didn’t honestly seem all that bothered when their brands appeared next to domestic violence and rape memes on Facebook. It was almost as if they didn’t see it for the gender-based hate speech that it was. It is refreshing to see both advertisers and politicians wake up to the toxic extremism that festers online. And as the Californian tech giants – media giants in disguise – hold immense power and influence, any news coverage of them is by definition a case of journalists doing their job. I don’t work for Google – or, at least, no more or less than any other journalist works for Google – but here’s my unsolicited advice on how to shrug off its current difficulty. First of all, repeat the apologies. Everybody knows a blog post about taking responsibility costs nothing compared to the horror of actual regulation. Secondly, the Google Digital News Initiative, which has earmarked €150 million to “spark new thinking” among media groups (funding projects at the Irish Times, Independent News & Media, and the Financial Times, among many others) remains a rather cheap way to neutralise the blow to a painfully disrupted news industry. Finally, as the press reverts to fighting dirty, don’t forget Silicon Valley’s talent for the fluffy and cutesy. Next month will see the first post-Brexit St George’s Day: better make that Google Doodle a good one.       Topics: Justin Cullen Core Media Emarketer Facebook Google News Corp YouTube Read More Guardian newspaper considering a move to tabloid - report Colm Keena: ‘Journalists in Europe’ crucial for hungry young reporters Dropping the paywall: Are newspapers dropping the ball?

Adding new features like saving videos to view offline, background playback and more. We get a lot of questions about YouTube content, but this is the biggest one. Here we’ll explain how to save or download YouTube videos and music to an Android device. To be clear, Google doesn’t approve of users downloading videos or music from YouTube to their Android devices, as that is technically piracy. However, they do allow certain videos to be temporarily saved on a device for offline playback. It’s limited to a short amount of time though. Not permanent. Read: How to Listen to YouTube Videos on iPhone Without Video The offline playback feature is one users asked about for a while, and arrived in late 2014. Many have enjoyed it for some time, but in 2016 it was pushed to a paid version of YouTube. It’s called YouTube Red, and for a small fee you can get this feature. Or, just follow our instructions below. There are plenty of apps available like YouTube Ripper that will pull content to download and save. As we said moments ago, this is illegal and Google or Apple quickly remove these types of apps from the store. Many mentioned in our comment section are no longer available either. We’ll say this one more time. Using some of the apps or services below are illegal. Google doesn’t allow users to steal content from YouTube. Whether that be video or audio. It’s against the rules to copy it to your device. That said, it is still very easy to do. Users can save entire videos to their device, or even pull music right from a video. Then download the MP3 file to an Android smartphone or tablet. Instructions First off we’ll explain the legal and Google-allowed system, which is saving videos for later playback. Certain videos that support this feature will have a download arrow just below the video on Android devices. Sadly this feature is now limited to YouTube Red subscribers. Tap the arrow and select a resolution or quality you’d like to save, and that’s it. Now just go into the menu bar on the left and select “Watch later” to find the list of saved videos to enjoy. These can be played without an internet connection. However, if you want to download a video or song permanently, that is an option as well. There are plenty of apps available to rip content from YouTube directly to your Android device. Rather than link to apps that aren’t available from the Google Play Store, or from shady sources, we’ve gathered a few simple websites that will do this for you. All users need is the URL from YouTube and a few clicks will download the song or video. While viewing a YouTube video just tap the 3-dotted “Share” button and on the popup that appears select “Copy URL”. Some versions it’s an arrow that stands for share. This is what you need, then navigate to websites like YouTubeMP3.to or clipconverter.cc and paste in that link. Usually within seconds they’ll convert the video, and deliver a MP3 of the music. Including a full video clip for the user to download and save to their Android smartphone or tablet. The first one has a slew of output options too. Copy and paste the URL into a site like YouTubeMP3 and simply hit convert, then download. From here you’re all done and the song has been saved to your smartphone or tablet. Other Details This same process is very easy to do from a PC or laptop, but just as easy on Android smartphones and tablets. Clipconverter even lets you select the conversion format to suite any occasion or need. Read: How to Create Custom Ringtones for Android Searching for “video downloader” or “Youtube Downloader” on the Google Play Store may find some results. Most have been removed as of early 2017. Instead use what’s mentioned above rather than apps. Don’t download any application for Android that claims to do this if it isn’t on the Google Play Store. Third party sources aren’t typically safe. Give it a try today and download some music or videos. Now users can enjoy any video, or the latest music to create your own custom ringtones with our how to above. Again, proceed at your own risk and enjoy. 37 Responses 09/16/2015 Orenko Reply Much easier with: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaweng.tubedownloader 06/02/2016 David Reply Watching youtube offline on mobile is really nice to kill boring time.

Half of Android devices weren't updated with Google's security patches over the past year, because operators and smartphone manufacturers didn't pass them on. Following the revelation that the Stagefright vulnerability was jeopardising the security of millions of Android smartphones and tablets, Google promised to release monthly updates to the platform, which would fix bugs and security holes identified by its experts. Manufacturers and mobile providers were supposed to roll them out to customers, but failed to, or issued them much later than Google did, meaning half of Android devices were exposed to attacks unnecessarily. The news comes off the back of Google's Android Year in Review Report, which revealed "more than 735 million devices from 200+ manufacturers received a platform security update in 2016." "Carrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates, releasing updates for over half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016," the company said. Although manufacturers including Samsung promised to issue fast track security updates, it's taken three months for some to be applied as part of the company's quarterly security patch. To try and improve the situation, Google has vowed to make it easier for manufacturers and mobile networks to roll out the update, ensuring everyone gets security patches applied faster than before. "We're working to increase device security updates by streamlining our security update program to make it easier for manufacturers to deploy security patches and releasing A/B updates to make it easier for users to apply those patches," Google explained in the report.

Reuters/Dado Ruvic Vodafone, Foxtel, Bunnings and more Australian companies are joining the boycott of YouTube advertising. The Google-owned video site has since apologised and promised to make necessary changes after it was learnt that unwitting companies’ ads appeared next to extremist content videos. YouTube is under fire for running ads on questionable videos without the brands knowing. According to Times of London investigation, rape apologists, banned hate preachers and anti-Semites receive payout from YouTube’s revenue-sharing system. They apparently get about US$7.60 (AU$9.97) per 1,000 views of an advertisement on their video. When that amount is multiplied by hundreds of thousands of views for every video, the video posters would get healthy amount of revenue from the video-sharing site. This meant companies behind the ads have unknowingly helped extremists get funding. The reaction from global brands has been swift. Companies have pulled their ads from YouTube following the revelation. Australian brands, such as Foxtel, Bunnings Warehouse, Seek, Vodafone, Caltex, Kia Motors Australia and Holden, have temporarily suspended their advertising from the website until YouTube has resolved the issue. Holden and Kia pulled their ads from YouTube after learning that their ads appeared on a video featuring an interview with Peter Lloyd, a “men’s right activist,” on a Channel 10 talk show. The video insults journalist and former Australian of the Year Ita Buttrose with misogynistic names. A Kia Motors Australia spokesman told Fairfax Media that its ad was suspended as soon as they were made aware of the video.  “It will remain suspended until such time as we can meet with Google to further clarify the application of this type of advertising,” he added. Foxtel was also concerned about how Google promoted its brand on content that publishes anti-Semitism. Its ad was run on a video interview with Brendon O’Connell, a Perth man who was found guilty of six counts of racial hatred in 2011. Seek and Bunnings’ ads also appeared on the same video, prompting both to suspend their advertisements with YouTube. Caltex, on the other hand, suspended all its digital advertisings on platforms other than YouTube after it emerged that its ad appeared on a video published by far-right Australian nationalist United Patriots Front lead Blair Cottrell, who made anti-Islam videos. A company rep said Caltex would work with its ad agency to ensure that its ads have more appropriate placements. Advertisers from US and UK, such as Johnson & Johnson, Verizon, BBC, Toyota and AT&T, have also pulled their ads from YouTube until Google is able to settle the matter. Google explained last week that it had expanded safeguards for its advertisers, although it didn’t appear the companies have been appeased by the solution as more brands joined the boycott even after the announcement. “Recently, we had a number of cases where brands’ ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologise,” Philipp Schindler, chief business officer, said in a statement dated March 21, adding that the company has begun conducting extensive review of the ad policies and tools. “Starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads more effective from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.” Google will also introduce new tools for advertisers to more easily manage where their ads appear on YouTube and the Web. These measurements include safer default settings for ads so brands would show on content that meet their standards.

"A greater number of people depend on platforms, such as social media for news consumption," Dr. Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, told reporters at a Google Inc. office in Seoul through a video conference.  Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, speaks to reporters at a Google Inc. office in Seoul through video conferencing on March 28, 2017. (Yonhap) The expert cited Digital News Report 2016 published by the institute, which is based on a survey of over 50,000 online news consumers in 26 countries, including the United States and South Korea. Google is one of the sponsors of the institute. The report suggests that news organizations and publishers across the world are facing unprecedented levels of disruption to business models and formats from a combination of more social platforms and general moves toward mobile devices. "In South Korea, the media is characterized by strong broadcasters, a newspaper sector struggling to adapt to digital change, along with powerful Korean-owned online portals, social networks and messaging applications," according to the report. "Forty-four percent of the respondents in 26 countries said they use Facebook as a source of news," he said, adding that more and more people use platforms, such as social media, than go directly to websites of news organizations or media outlets. "But it is different in (South) Korea as Facebook dominates 24 percent, while Kakao Talk dominates 22 percent," he said. Kakao Talk is the country's most popular mobile messenger with 38 million users out of a 51 million population. Nielsen also highlighted that South Korea is unique in the way people check news. "Compared with other markets, South Korea is a developed market in which searches are significantly more important than in other countries," he said. More than 60 percent of the respondents in South Korea said they used "searches" to come across news stories, compared with 30 percent in the U.S. and 38 percent in Japan. "On-year growth of using smartphones to check the news shows no signs of slowing down," according to the report. "Smartphone news access is higher than computer access in South Korea, Switzerland and Sweden." The expert said South Korea, one of the most mobile-centered markets, is clearly leading the market in terms of smartphone usage. In South Korea, 48 percent of the respondents said they use smartphones as the main device to access news, followed by 41 percent for computers and tablets accounting for only 4 percent. He also cited the rise of platforms is not only a challenge but also can serve as an opportunity for news organizations. "Media organizations have to face that their revenues will be smaller than in the 1990s. There is no solution for this problem," he said. "It is important to understand the point of view of journalists and users." The doctor advised media groups to transform themselves as a "multi-product" company so that they can adapt better to different technology and changes to the overall media environment.

Now musicians, museums, sports teams, sports leagues, and movies are eligible to use Google Posts in the US. Google Posts allows those who qualify to publish text, images, videos, and events to the front page of search results. When users search for the name of the entity, the front page will display the latest Google Posts. Posts appear instantly on mobile and desktop, just as they would on Twitter, Facebook, or other social networks. Alternatively, posts can be scheduled to be published at a later time. On the publisher’s side, Google will provide metrics on how many people have seen and interacted with the posts. In order to publish via Google Posts, you will first have to be verified to represent the entity which can be accomplished through Google My Business. Then, if your business category is currently supported by Google Posts, you’ll have to fill out an application here. The company says it will respond via email within a week of the application with status update. Google says its continuing to experiment with other categories and regions, so expect Google Posts to be rolled out to more entities in the future.

Quick, I’ll wait. For all the things Google Maps does well, finding new locations isn’t one of them. Sure, it’s great at the finding part, but overloading me with options while I’m trying to find a taco really isn’t what I’m looking for in most cases. It’s the “what’s for dinner?” argument between you and your spouse each night, only in this case you spouse is a smartphone. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT Karta GPS is different. It’s not Google Maps, and it really isn’t trying to be. Instead, it takes what Google does well (directions, offline maps, etc.) and adds some really great new features. One of my favorites is curation. Rather than telling me there are 900 taco spots nearby (it’s California, that might not be an exaggeration), Karta GPS taps the likes of Yelp and Foursquare to give me a handful of options — good ones. Instead of curling up in the passenger seat and crying, or picking the closest taqueria because I’m hungry and don’t feel like researching my carne asada, I can get instant insight without the need for a second app. Curation aside, a navigation app wouldn’t be much use if it were bad at getting you from Point A to Point B. Using OpenStreetMap — a Wikipedia-style community of nearly 6,000 daily contributors of map data — Karta provides both online and offline maps that’ll get you where you need to go. Its partnership with INRIX makes the app even more impressive. INRIX, which we covered previously, is a global leader in the traffic space that uses satellite imagery, user data, and speed cameras to paint a crystal clear picture of the road ahead, even in sparsely populated areas. It’s not Google Maps, but Karta’s feature set will grow over time, and it’s already pretty outstanding. It’s definitely worth a look, especially for anyone already using a third-party (non-Google/Apple Maps) solution. It’s free, and available now on both iOS and Android.

LastPass calls the vulnerability 'unique and highly sophisticated'. By Jake Smith for iGeneration | March 28, 2017 -- 01:39 GMT (18:39 PDT) | Topic: Security LastPass browser extension (LastPass) LastPass on Monday acknowledged a remote code execution vulnerability that affects version 4.1.42 of the LastPass extension on Chrome. The client side vulnerability was discovered over the weekend by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy. "We are now actively addressing the vulnerability. This attack is unique and highly sophisticated," LastPass wrote in a blog post. national security FBI, CIA launch investigation into WikiLeaks file dump The agencies say the release of CIA documents to the public should be considered "deeply troubling." Read More LastPass didn't give specifics about the vulnerability or when a fix may be released, but promised more details when the issue is resolved. Ormandy previously found exploits in earlier versions of LastPass on March 20, and said it was possible to proxy untrusted messages to LastPass. LastPass updated its users the same day with an incident report that detailed all "extensions have been patched and are being re-released to users". Ormandy hasn't released details surrounding the latest vulnerability detailed by LastPass on Monday, but said in a tweet it's a new exploit. Writing in the Project Zero issue tracker on March 20, Ormandy said the version's vulnerability was possible to proxy untrusted messages to LastPass. "This allows complete access to internal privileged LastPass RPC commands," the researcher said. "There are hundreds of internal LastPass RPCs, but the obviously bad ones are things copying and filling in passwords (copypass, fillform, etc)." Furthermore, if a user had the LastPass binary component installed, the system was vulnerable to remote code execution. LastPass is encouraging its users to use LastPass Vault to launch sites directly, be aware of phishing attacks, and enable two-factor authentication where they can.

While it’s not as annoying as the sound distortion bug, it’s still good to hear that Google has found a way to patch up the Bluetooth issue that affected some Pixel users in the past few weeks. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list The problem was first detailed last month after Google released its February Security Patch. Affected devices would randomly drop Bluetooth connections, as the radio would be turned off. That means music would stop playing on Bluetooth speakers, and headsets used for phone calls would suddenly stop working. Google failed to fix the issue in the March Security Patch, even though the company did acknowledge the problem. But on Friday, a Googler posted a note on a product form, as discovered by GSM Arena. “I just got word that Google has just finished putting a fix in place for this issue on our end — no downloads or updates to your devices or apps are needed,” the Google employee wrote. “We’d love to hear feedback from this group. If you have a chance to test your Bluetooth connection, please let us know how it goes.” Google made some “server-side changes” to fix the issue, although it’s not clear exactly what that means. If you’re still experiencing Bluetooth issues on your Google Pixel or Pixel XL, don’t freak out. A Google Play Services update should bring the fix to your phone. If, on the other hand, you still get Bluetooth connectivity issues after the upgrade, make sure you tell Google about it here.

Credit Suisse released a report last week that suggested Amazon's entry could be rated as somewhere between "Catastrophe" and "We're all going to die". But is it all Amazon's fault? There's no control experiment we can conduct to see what will actually happen when Amazon enters the local market. But when a new entrant joins a market, there are a few things that can happen. The market can expand. We saw this when Google released Android. While Android devices outsell iOS, Apple's sales are still solid after a period of growth. When Google entered the market they didn't take Apple's customers; they added new customers to the smartphone market. If the market is mature, then the likelihood is a new entrant will take customers away from incumbents. Think of Netflix and the corner video rental store. Or corner stores when supermarkets extended their trading hours. Most experts expect retail to follow the Netflix/video store path rather than the Android/iOS one. There's a big difference though. Big retail has had a 15 year window to get ready. Online commerce is not new. As soon as the Internet became a commercial platform, people started selling stuff over it. Also, large retailers could learn the lessons of the bookstore business and from video rentals and Netflix. Macy's in the US is a good case study of why local retail is going to have its work cut out for it in order to compete with Amazon and other online retailers. And we're seeing what some call a "retail mall apocalypse" taking place with over 3,500 stores being shut down by retailers like Macy's, JCPenney, Sears, and Kmart, Crocs, BCBG, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Guess. Some of the chains are closing hundreds of stores this year. Macy's is more than a department store - it's a symbol for traditional retail. Their business model is large stores that are heavily staffed selling a wide variety of goods. Almost every city in the US has a Macy's store - the one in New York is practically a tourist attraction. But the chain has struggled over recent years and their long term CEO stepped down this year. Comments by their CFO, Karen Hoguet, says their most significant existential threat isn't Amazon. In a recent interview CNBC story, Hoguet said the issue is their supply chain. And a walk through local stores highlights that the same challenge exists here. Customers want to buy what what they want to buy when they want to buy it. Online retailers like Amazon make this easy. And if you don't know what you want, Amazon's recommendation system will tell you! The answer from local retailers to these challenges has been typically myopic. There's been the gnashing of teeth over GST on imports with the government now threatening to collect GST on personal imports. What Harvey and his mates don't understand is that we don't just buy online because of the price (although that is part of the allure). We buy online because we can find what we want, when we want it and get it shipped cheaply. It's a combination of price, product and service. Penalty rates have been cut. Again, when under pressure local retailers revert to their default position of cutting costs by screwing those who can least afford to be screwed. When was the last time you read about an executive management team who took a pay cut rather than cut coal-face salaries? US retailer TJ Maxx is planning to enter the Australian market and their model could be an insight into the sort of retail experience that can survive and thrive locally. I shopped at TJ Maxx when on holidays last year (in the lovely town of Bend in Oregon. If you're into outdoor sports like trail running, paddle boarding and canoeing, skiing and the like, you need to go to Bend). It is an impulse shopper's paradise. TJ Maxx has a rapidly changing inventory that is driven by two factors. What is available and what can be quickly sold. It's a simple formula. But I'll bet you can walk into a large Australian retailer and find items that are months old sitting on a rack. That doesn't happen at TJ Maxx. If you walk into Myer, JB HiFi or any other retail chain in Australia, you'll find the same items in the same place in each store. TJ Maxx puts its inventory wherever it can place it as quickly and cheaply as they can. Say you want to buy a hat. Just because you see it at one TJ Maxx store there's no guarantee, if fact there's almost no chance, you'll find it at another outlet. That model might not work for everyone and Australian shopping habits are different to those in the US. Our population is far more centralised with most of the population living in large urban centres. So we are accustomed to a more tactile shopping experience. But that is changing as more of us move our shopping dollars online. I'm pretty sure that when Amazon officially starts trading in Australia that the lead story on all the current affairs shows will be Gerry Harvey bleating about foreign retailers screwing Aussie businesses. Harvey and his counterparts have had over a decade to prepare for this. To compete, they will need a multi platform strategy with a 21st century supply chain. That will include retail stores, but it's likely they will be a lot smaller and only stock large items like furniture, white goods and major appliances. Commodity items that can be easily and cheaply shipped will slowly disappear and only be sold online - it makes no sense to ship printer ink from a manufacturer to a warehouse, to a store in the hope it will be purchased off the shelf. Skipping the store and shipping to the customer from the warehouse should result in a cost reduction that could be passed on to the customer. This will, theoretically reduce prices and allow them compete with new market entrants. And, as warehouses are cheaper to own and manage than retail stores, there's further opportunity to reduce costs. With more people needed in warehouses, employment will shift. While job losses are possible, I expect to see job changes account for many of the lost store jobs with people shifting from shopping centres to warehouses. It won't be as sexy, but it will be a job. the Big retail still has some time to get their stuff together. But the clock is ticking and, so far, there hasn't been any evidence that they are prepared to adapt to the new world. I guess blaming Amazon in the 21`st century is easier than admitting your 19th century business model is broken. Amazon Is About To Kick Traditional Retail’s Butt We are at the dawn of a new era - and like the dinosaurs who just thought they were having an off day - many Aussie retailers aren’t going to know what’s hit them. In the coming months Amazon will start opening its online doors in Australia. And already locals are seeing an impact.

And you think Amazon will be paying over the odds for staff. Google 'Amazon Workers' and get a feel for the Worker's Nirvana Amazon employees face. Don't get me wrong. While traditional retail will need to lift their game to compete, let's not pretend any of the new entrants will have any altruistic motives. Reply 1 Anthony Caruana @anthonycaruana AUTHOR Mar 28, 2017, 4:08pm Amazon will pay, I assume, the lowest they can legally pay. But the motivation for the recent cut in rates is about cost cutting by the incumbents. As far as I know Amazon was not involved in lobbying for the recent penalty rate cuts. Reply 0 anthonyp69 @anthonyp69 Mar 28, 2017, 12:59pm What warehouses is this author talking about? Most retails don't use their own warehouses anymore, unless they import stock themselves. They will pull in stock from the importer/wholesalers warehouse. The Importer/wholesaler generally doesn't do retail. Amazons model only works if they import and warehouse all their inventory. Most branded products in Australia will already be imported under a licensed importer. Reply 1 Anthony Caruana @anthonycaruana AUTHOR Mar 28, 2017, 4:05pm It doesn't matter, in my view, whose warehouse. If more stuff moves from warehouses to customers then the warehouse operators will need to increase their slicking and shipping capacity Reply 0 Cameron @moonhead Mar 28, 2017, 5:01pm I look at Bunnings as one that's ripe for disruption. They have an utterly pathetic web presence right now, If Amazon handle hardware well, can deliver the core range Bunnings have (which wouldn't be hard with their hopeless range), and can sort out deliveries properly, they'll (hopefully) smack Bunnings around enough to actually get some real competition into the sector!

The Diverted Profits Tax Bill 2017 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017 were introduced into Parliament by Treasurer, Scott Morrison, in February, and were passed by the Senate into law on 27 March, having already made their way through the House of Representatives. In the words of the Bills’ explanatory memorandum, the new legislation aims to “ensure that the tax paid by significant global entities properly reflects the economic substance of their activities in Australia and aims to prevent the diversion of profits offshore through contrived”. Ultimately, the new laws will see some companies that book their profits in international regions that claim a lower tax rate than Australia’s standard 30 per cent company rate slugged with a tax bill based on a rate of 40 per cent. The move to crack down on multinationals’ profit-shifting practices was announced by the government in the 2016-17 Budget. It follows a series of parliamentary inquiry hearings carried out in 2015 that saw representatives from some of the largest technology companies operating in Australia grilled by a Senate committee panel about their tax practices in Australia. Among those under scrutiny were Apple, Microsoft, and Google, all of which have been on the Government’s radar in relation to their local tax practices. In 2013, Labor MP, Ed Husic, singled out Apple over its tax practices, questioning how the company's local operation could accrue $5.5 billion in costs. "How? They don't manufacture here, there are no factories here. I don't know what their R&D effort is here," he said at the time, according to ZDNet. Read more Defence personnel IT system replacement “over budget and behind schedule” In 2015, during a Parliamentary hearing, Google Australia’s then managing director, Maile Carnegie, revealed that the company reported profits exceeding $46 million in 2013, while paying just $7.1 million tax for that year – well below Australia’s standard company tax rate. Now, with the Diverted Profits Tax in place, the Government hopes to see fewer examples of large companies paying a tax rate that falls below the standard company rate, and expects the new measures to raise $100 million in revenue a year from 2018-19. However, the new laws will only apply to multinationals that have a global income of more than $1 billion and an Australian income of more than $25 million. The legislation is also aimed at complementing existing anti-tax avoidance rules such as the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) to clamp down on artificial profit shifting by major multinationals and increased penalties for breach of tax reporting obligations for global companies with incomes of $1 billion or more. Read more ​The Yield - Inside the mind of Mother Nature Additionally, the Diverted Profits Tax will not apply to managed investment trusts or similar foreign entities, sovereign wealth funds and foreign pension funds. This exclusion is aimed at ensuring that such entities do not face an unnecessary compliance burden as a result of the introduction of the Diverted Profits Tax.

By Avi Salzman March 27, 2017 5:07 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Recent controversy surrounding YouTube content could push advertisers back toward traditional television. Illustration: Pixabay Major advertisers, including Starbucks, General Motors, and Wal-Mart, have pulled their advertising from YouTube in recent days amid reports that the video service was running their ads next to hateful content. The sudden wave of defections from the Google-owned video company comes at a particularly bad time for Google and its corporate parent Alphabet: the television upfronts are starting, and TV networks are likely to use this controversy to highlight the benefits of advertising alongside professionally produced content. Barron’s Next Why Some Advertisers Are Walking Out on Google Can Investors Still Trust Facebook? Twitter’s Plan for Online Abuse? Ignorance is Bliss Google has made billions running ads against search results and user-generated content, selling advertisers on the premise that Google knows their customers better than anyone. For the most part, advertisers are still on board with Google search ads, although FX Networks, part of 21st Century Fox, went so far as to stop all advertising, including Google search ads. YouTube is a different story. The sheer volume of video content -- 400 hours of video are uploaded per minute -- makes policing the platform particularly difficult, and Google’s automated scanning software has done a mediocre job so far. Content from major brands has been running with videos that mock black and Jewish people, according to a review of content by the Wall Street Journal. Other reviews indicated ads were running along with content supporting terrorists. This has likely been happening for a while, but renewed media attention has made it a more pressing issue. And Google’s response has been too casual for many advertisers. TV stations are likely to emphasize the benefits of advertising with a known entity rather than hoping an algorithm can connect brands with customers. “For television networks defending their positions against a backdrop of continued linear ratings decay, the ‘content quality’ and transparency argument has always been a key talking point,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Peter Stabler. “With the growing number of major marketers electing to either pause or reallocate YouTube spending, we believe the argument will be presented with renewed vigor.” Instinet analyst Anthony DiClemente expects the controversy to reduce Google’s revenue by about $750 million, a small amount for a company that made $90 billion last year. But he warns that costs could rise as Google comes up with a solution. The company’s response to the controversy could determine if the problem gets bigger, or begins to diminish. Big Picture: Google is in hot water as brands have been pulling their ads following revelations that they were running against offensive content.

The Diverted Profits Tax Bill 2017 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017 were introduced into Parliament by Treasurer, Scott Morrison, in February, and were passed by the Senate into law on 27 March, having already made their way through the House of Representatives. In the words of the Bills’ explanatory memorandum, the new legislation aims to “ensure that the tax paid by significant global entities properly reflects the economic substance of their activities in Australia and aims to prevent the diversion of profits offshore through contrived”. Ultimately, the new laws will see some companies that book their profits in international regions that claim a lower tax rate than Australia’s standard 30 per cent company rate slugged with a tax bill based on a rate of 40 per cent. The move to crack down on multinationals’ profit-shifting practices was announced by the government in the 2016-17 Budget. It follows a series of parliamentary inquiry hearings carried out in 2015 that saw representatives from some of the largest technology companies operating in Australia grilled by a Senate committee panel about their tax practices in Australia. Among those under scrutiny were Apple, Microsoft, and Google, all of which have been on the Government’s radar in relation to their local tax practices. In 2013, Labor MP, Ed Husic, singled out Apple over its tax practices, questioning how the company's local operation could accrue $5.5 billion in costs. "How? They don't manufacture here, there are no factories here. I don't know what their R&D effort is here," he said at the time, according to ZDNet.

Now, with the Diverted Profits Tax in place, the Government hopes to see fewer examples of large companies paying a tax rate that falls below the standard company rate, and expects the new measures to raise $100 million in revenue a year from 2018-19. However, the new laws will only apply to multinationals that have a global income of more than $1 billion and an Australian income of more than $25 million. The legislation is also aimed at complementing existing anti-tax avoidance rules such as the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) to clamp down on artificial profit shifting by major multinationals and increased penalties for breach of tax reporting obligations for global companies with incomes of $1 billion or more.

This exclusion is aimed at ensuring that such entities do not face an unnecessary compliance burden as a result of the introduction of the Diverted Profits Tax.

From the picture he tweeted, we can see that the phone has a speaker cutout at the top and maybe a volume rocker on the side of the device. Some reports have speculated that the phone seems to be running a version of Android, which makes since considering the phone is coming from Rubin's own company, but that detail has not been confirmed yet by Essential.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google Android inventor Andy Rubin offers peek of new smartphone said to be iPhone rival By Ethan Baron / March 27, 2017 at 2:44 PM To build a smartphone to take on the iPhone and high-end Android devices, it would be nice to have an office full of former Apple and Google engineers. Check. And it certainly would be helpful to have invented software for a smartphone operating system yourself. Check. Having spent time as a powerful executive at one of the firms targeted for disruption would also be an asset. Check. Then you might want to drum up some hype. Check. It’s been about 2 1/2 months since a report suggested that Android inventor and former high-profile Google executive Andy Rubin was starting up a hardware company, to be built around a flagship phone. “Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its chief executive officer,” Bloomberg reported Jan. 13, citing anonymous sources. The “centerpiece” for a planned lineup of Essential products would be a phone “with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel,” according to Bloomberg. Rubin left his senior vice-president position at Google in November 2014 after nearly a decade with the company. In November 2015 he registered Essential Products, Inc. with California regulators and late last year the firm registered “Essential” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, naming smartphones, tablets and operating software for mobile phones as products, Bloomberg said. “While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin’s phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Alphabet Inc.’s new Pixel reside,” the news outlet reported. Rubin, who co-created Android software, sold Android to Google in 2005 and then led transformation of the software into the most prevalent smartphone operating system on the planet. He had reportedly suffered a blow earlier this year when SoftBank pulled out of a planned $100 million investment in Essential “partly because of the Japanese investor’s increasingly close relationship with Apple,” the Wall Street Journal reported (paywall). But if a tantalizing tweet from Rubin on March 27 is any indication, loss of the planned SoftBank funding didn’t kill Essential or its phone. “I’m really excited about how this is shaping up,” Rubin tweeted above a photo of a phone mostly covered up by a hand. “Eager to get it in more people’s hands… ” In the photo, only a corner of the phone is shown. It appears to possess a very narrow bezel, although it’s possible that what appears to be a bezel in the photo is an external protector. Rubin’s tweet quickly drew worldwide attention, from the tech press to the Daily Mail. That online newspaper’s coverage is noteworthy for a sidebar showing, apparently, Rubin’s dog barking at a Google robot. The phone is expected to hit the market around the middle of this year and cost about as much as an iPhone 7, Bloomberg reported, suggesting a retail price of $649. Whether the Essential phone runs on Android remains to be seen. width=&#8221;100%&#8221; height=&#8221;160px&#8221; scrolling=&#8221;no&#8221; frameborder=&#8221;0&#8243;&gt;   Photo: Photo of the corner of a phone, posted on Twitter by Android inventor Andy Rubin (Twitter) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Alphabet, android, Andy Rubin, Apple, Google, iPhone, smartphone   More Posts in Big Tech Google self-driving vehicle spin-off Waymo follows the techie hordes to Tahoe March 27, 2017   Activists to target lawmakers who vote against net privacy rules March 27, 2017   Treasury Secretary Mnuchin draws one-word response from Mark Cuban after comments on robots taking jobs March 24, 2017       Share this Post Tweet       math_calculator another pirate company.Years ago pirating copying apple design to create android os, and dolge lawsuit by non-profitting sharing.Now he wants to create another shady company to pirate in a more public way. intellectual property, people!

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Chrome 57 Gets Stable Release For Chromebooks Bringing Action For Power Button On Convertibles By Zara Ali Mar 24, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Since last week, Google has been rolling out the full-fledged version 57 of Chrome for desktops and Android. In the latest addition, the stable version of Chrome 57 is now available for Chrome OS devices that are new Chromebooks. No, it does not bring Play Store on board, but we expect it to debut with Chrome 58. There are many convertible Chromebooks on offer and to make the existing design more suitable, Google has finally decided to take advantage of the power button on convertibles. The button will now behave like normal power button with conventional sleep switch that is found on regular tablets and smartphones. Earlier, this button on Chromebook would only lock the screen or bring the login screen. Now, the same button will put the device in sleep mode with its display turned off. Related Chrome 57 for Android Gets Custom Tabs Options And Progressive Web Apps Google recently introduced the education-centric Chromebook in association with HP. It comes with a “world-facing camera.” that also works adequately on tablet mode. The camera has also received an overhaul, and it now has an on-screen button that lets users switch between rear camera and front-facing camera. Also, there are other changes too, which includes newer default wallpaper and boot animation. Users can now lock/unlock their devices by PIN number; earlier it required passwords. Advertisement The new stable version of Chrome 57 squashes many bugs and brings security updates that include: Related Chrome 57 Comes With Stricter Throttling Policy To Lessen Power Usage Of Background Tabs Enable silent authentication Updated default wallpaper Updated boot animation Media files from Android Applications available in Files Application PIN unlock is available on all Chromebooks Chrome Camera App Front/Rear Flip UI Image copy/paste feature for Citrix Receiver on Chrome OS Power button now turns off display on devices that support tablet-mode Notably, the stable release 57.0.2987.123 (Platform version: 9202.56.1) has been rolled out for all the Chromebooks except for a few. The ones that are not getting the stable version are – AOpen Chromebase Mini, AOpen Chromebox Mini, Google Chromebook Pixel (2015), ASUS Chromebook Flip C302, ASUS Chromebook Flip C100PA, Samsung Chromebook Plus, Acer Chromebook R13 (CB5 – 312T).

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google To Reportedly Remove SMS Support From Hangouts On May 22 By Zara Ali Mar 24, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Google recently announced the new version of Hangouts, which is focussed on catering enterprises. Now that Google is more keen on developing Android Messages as a unified messaging platform for Android, the company is reportedly stripping Hangouts of SMS feature. As Android Messages is Google’s RCS (Rich Communication Service) product, the company wants to gear it up with more capabilities. In an alleged e-mail directed to G Suite administrators, Google revealed that it would take away SMS capability from the app in May. Well, that makes sense as Google would unquestionably want to promote Android Messages over Hangouts as a more suitable messaging platform. Related Google Duo Gets Voice Call Support While Google Translate Gets ‘Definitions’ Section Google justifies the move by calling it a part of its strategy to promote Hangouts for its main features i.e. video conferencing and video calling. The app will now be promoted for its video communication capabilities rather than text messages. For text messaging, Google has Android Messages that will be its standalone take for messaging. The tech giant will start the cross-over from next week, wherein it will ask Hangouts users to choose other default messaging app. In case the user does not have an alternative app already installed on the device, he/she will be automatically redirected to the Play Store. When the user chooses a new app, his previous messages will also automatically restored into the new app so that he does not miss on any important text. The alleged e-mail from Google also says that on May 22, SMS features will cease to function on Hangouts. Advertisement It is worth mentioning that Google Voice users will still have the SMS functionality working for them. Google Voice will enjoy continuous SMS service after May deadline as well. In the purported e-mail, Google apparently says: Related Google Play Store Takes Inspiration From App Store, Adds ‘Free App of the Week’ Section For Google Voice users on Hangouts on Android Google Voice users who do not use carrier SMS text messaging will not be affected and no notification will be shown. For non-SMS users on Hangouts on Android No notification will be shown to users who do not have Hangouts enabled as the default SMS messenger app on their device. Even though the e-mail is not confirmed, it does looks believable as Google would anyway alert its enterprise clients before the general ones about the upcoming changes. It remains to be seen what Google comments on the e-mail. Stay tuned with us more information on the news.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Information Technology Google trains one million Africans in digital skills Published March 28, 2017March 27, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Google Google has trained one million Africans, including Nigerians, in digital skills within a year. It also announced plans to train more people in the coming year. In addition to the new target, the company said it was extending its commitment to the digital skill programme by assisting local communities further in several ways. “First, Google will provide offline versions of its online training materials to reach individuals and businesses in low access areas where it is unable to hold physical training sessions. Additionally, Google will provide offline versions of the content in languages like Hausa, Swahili and IsiZulu,” the Country Manager, Google Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, said. According to her, the digital skills programme offers 89 courses through the online portal, adding that “Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face-to-face training.” She said, “The programme will also be addressing needs for small business owners, who are looking to better understand how to take advantage of the web across Africa. Google will add web-focused skills training for the Small Medium Enterprises across Africa as part of this initiative.” Chiazor said that the web was a driver of economic growth, “and is transforming society as a whole.” She said, “People must be equipped, through training and reskilling to make use of the tools, and take advantage of it for entrepreneurship, employment and e-inclusion. “Our goal with this and previous web training initiatives is to enable more people across the continent to better understand how to leverage the web tools for growth – to give them access to better employment and/or the skills to start their own business. Digitally skilled Africa is good for everyone – for our economy; for entrepreneurs and individuals; and good for Internet companies like Google.” The Growth Engine and Brand Lead, sub-Saharan Africa, Google, Bunmi Banjo, said, “Having one million digitally skilled young people in Africa is good for everyone. If young people have the right skills, they will build businesses, create jobs and boost economic growth across the continent.” She added, “As we expand this initiative to reach more local areas across the continent, we hope to see more impact in everyday lives of Africans.” A group of 65 Googlers from nine different countries helped Livity to develop content, provide mentorishop and, in some cases, deliver the training.

The move seems to be based on scanning what users say in their messages to friends: Stan Chudnovsky, Messenger head of product, said that one of the most common things people say in the app is “How far away are you?”. He added: “It happes to be what people are saying, what they’re interested in the most.” In its blog post announcing the new feature, Facebook was keen to stress that it’s “completely optional. You are always in control.” Uber halts driverless car tests after crash Uber has called a halt to its experiments with self-driving cars in Arizona after one of its vehicles was involved in a crash that left it lying damaged on its side. Local police in Tempe, Arizona, said that there was a human behind the wheel at the time, but “it is uncertain at this time if they were controlling the vehicle at the time of the collision”. Police added that the accident happened when another car “failed to yield” on a left turn. Meanwhile, however, the taxi app company’s driverless cars were back on the streets of San Francisco on Monday after reversing its determination not to register the cars with the state’s vehicle licensing authority. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” the company said on Monday. Schoolboy corrects NASA data Astronaut Tim Peake has thanked a 17-year-old schoolboy who spotted an error in NASA data and emailed the space agency to let them know. Miles Soloman from Sheffield was studying the TimPix project, which lets schoolchildren download data recorded by radiation detectors on the International Space Station during Tim Peake’s six-month mission on the ISS. When Soloman sorted the data, he spotted a problem: “I went straight to the bottom of the list and went to the lowest bits of energy there were,” he told the BBC. “I noticed that where we should have no energy, there was no radiation – it was actually showing -1. The first thing I thought was ‘well, you can’t have negative energy’, and then we realised this was an error.” NASA said they thought they had corrected for the error and that Soloman’s correction was “appreciated more so than it being embarrassing”.

Reply Tim Dawson says: March 27, 2017 at 7:32 pm I tried to tell the electricity company that I was only using negative energy and they owed me £1500. They didn’t believe me. Reply Adam says: March 27, 2017 at 11:51 pm Well, if you could prove to them in some way that you really were using negative energy and they really do owe you £1500, one imagines they might be more inclined to believe you. Reply Adam says: March 27, 2017 at 11:49 pm I wonder if NASA has also extended an internship (if only a temporary one) to that eagle-eyed student, or at least an invitation to come tour one of their facilities. It’d be a nice “thank you” for spotting the error, but an official thanks from NASA is still pretty cool. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Two other flagships, equally worthy of attention, are expected launch later in the year — Samsung’s foldable device, the Samsung Galaxy X, and Google’s Pixel successor, the Pixel 2. While Google confirmed March 3 that a Pixel 2 device is in the works, the existence of a Samsung Galaxy X is largely supported by rumors and Samsung’s recent patents. Both phones are expected to be premium devices with high-end features. Read: iPhone X vs. Samsung Galaxy X Let’s compare both and find out how they match up against each other. Display Both the Samsung Galaxy X and the Google Pixel 2 are expected to have different displays than their predecessors. The Pixel 2 is expected to have an edge-to-edge display which will provide the users with more screen area than what’s present on current devices. The Samsung Galaxy X is expected to have a foldable display mechanism — an inward folding display with two screens on opposite sides and a mechanical hinge with a screen in the middle. When spread out straight, it would have a tablet-like form factor. Processor Both devices could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835. The current stock of the processor is reserved to cater to Samsung Galaxy S8 production, but since both the devices are expected to launch later in the year, both could possibly have the 10nm technology-based processor. Camera While no information is available about the camera on Google X, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to build on the success of its predecessor. The company is currently developing a camera technology for improving low-light performance of cameras, according to 9to5 Google. AI-Voice Assistants Both devices are expected to come with artificial intelligence based voice assistants. While the Samsung Galaxy X is expected to come with Bixby, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to come with an improved version of the Google Assistant. OS While the Samsung Galaxy X is expected to come with Android Nougat OS, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be the first smartphone to come with the next iteration of Android – Android O. Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 vs. Google Pixel 2 Both smartphones are expected to be IP68 standard waterproof. While the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be priced at $649, the same as the Google Pixel, the Samsung Galaxy X is expected to be priced upward of $1,000.

China's Great Firewall yet another trade barrier | Bangkok Post: opinion News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More OPINION Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive Today's paper DIGITAL VERSION SIGN IN About E-Newspaper Subscribe Report problem Free Trial HOME DELIVERY opinion homepage Opinion View latest View by columnist Postbag Online poll Most commented Expat forum Opinion > Opinion China's Great Firewall yet another trade barrier Adam Minter Writer Twitter 28 Mar 2017 at 04:10 NEWSPAPER SECTION: NEWS 587 viewed0 comments Any Chinese attempt to ignore WTO rulings would undermine its recent posturing as a champion of free trade. (Image via Creative Commons) - + The San Francisco-based photo-sharing site Pinterest would seem to rank low on the list of potential threats to China. Beloved by fashion designers, photographers, cooks and hobbyists, the seven-year-old website is a global hub for the sharing of images, trends and ideas on topics ranging from living-room design to what to cook at your Saturday barbecue. Unfortunately, Pinterest's innocuousness couldn't save it from the same fate as other foreign internet companies in China, including Facebook and Alphabet (formerly known as Google). Earlier this month, the Chinese government blocked Chinese internet users from accessing the site. And that should make Pinterest of interest to the Trump administration, as well as China. Pinterest's troubles aren't unique. Last year, China excluded thousands of US websites from China, including eight of the 25 most-trafficked global sites. Yet, so far at least, there's been hardly a word of protest out of Washington against these systematic denials of market access. Similar restrictions against US automakers, say, would almost certainly have prompted complaints to the World Trade Organisation. The costs imposed by this policy are adding up. In 2015, the global value of international data flows came to US$2.8 trillion, exceeding the global flow of merchandise for the first time. The US economy has benefited more than most from that trade. In 2014, the US exported nearly $400 billion in digital services, accounting for more than half of all US services exports and generating a $159 billion trade surplus in the sector. Though it's impossible to calculate what Facebook, Google and Twitter might've earned in China's booming internet sector had they been allowed to compete, there's little question that they would have added measurably to that surplus. For example, the New York Times, a tiny digital business compared to Facebook, claims to have lost at least $3 million due to the blocking of its website in 2012. The Chinese government is doubtless aware of the opportunities that online protectionism creates for domestic companies. In June 2009, China blocked Twitter; two months later, Sina Corp launched a wildly successful knock-off microblog, Weibo, that has thrived for years in the absence of foreign competition. Likewise, when Google announced in May 2010 that it was contemplating the total shutdown of its Chinese offices, the stock of Baidu -- its leading Chinese competitor and a keen observer and imitator of Google's business -- rallied 16.6 per cent in a single day, while smaller rivals enjoyed similar bumps. Meanwhile, local Chinese versions of Pinterest have flooded China's market since 2012 with middling success. If the recent ban holds, at least one of those companies may enjoy a highly lucrative opportunity to become "China's Pinterest". Pinterest's options, on the other hand, are limited. The Chinese government is notoriously opaque about why it blocks sites, and there are no formal procedures for appeal. (Mark Zuckerberg's years-long lobbying effort to push Facebook back into China might qualify as the informal process.) That's not just unfair. It's also a likely violation of China's treaty obligations under the World Trade Organisation, which requires transparency, due process and non-discrimination in government decisions affecting companies. The idea of dragging China before the WTO to argue the Great Firewall represents a trade barrier isn't a new idea. The European Union has contemplated such an approach since at least the late 2000s. And late last year, in a move that could lay the groundwork for a case, the Obama administration argued that China's worsening censorship posed a "significant burden" on foreign internet service providers. The next step, though -- a formal complaint and case before the WTO -- is up to the Trump Administration. Such a case wouldn't be a slam dunk. China has long cited WTO clauses that give countries room to impose measures to protect public morality and order. Even if it lost the WTO case, the Chinese government would be highly unlikely to abide by the decision in full. But the WTO recently ruled against a Chinese attempt to invoke public morality as an excuse to restrict the import and distribution of American books, magazines, films and other published material. And any Chinese attempt to ignore WTO rulings would undermine its recent posturing as a champion of free trade. A negotiated settlement -- perhaps integrated into a long-delayed US-China investment treaty -- that opens China to US internet companies while acknowledging China's right to censor selectively (not wholesale) for morality and public order, might be the best outcome for all sides. ©2017 BLOOMBERG VIEW Adam Minter is an American writer based in Asia, where he covers politics, culture, business and the environment.

Stop Worrying About AI Destroying Humans, Expert Says By Marcy Kreiter @marcykreiter On 03/27/17 AT 6:15 PM Close Don’t worry about artificial intelligence taking over the world and endangering humans — at least not to start with, said Demis Hassabis, the head of Google’s AI project. Hassabis, CEO of Deep Mind, a British business Google bought in 2014, said he has rebuked the likes of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk for their comments on AI, the Times of London reported Monday. AI is the theory and development of computer systems that can perform tasks that mornally take human intelligence. Read: Will Robots Take Over? “I don’t think it’s very helpful for other people who are incredible in their domains commenting on something they actually know very little about, but because they are quite big celebrities now, more than just scientists or businessmen, it gets picked up a lot,” he said at a Cambridge Society for the Application of Research event. He said the “general meme of fearfulness doesn’t help reasoned debate. It actually drives that debate away. ” Deep Mind currently is analyzing patient data for the Royal Free Hospital in London and working on an agreement for optimizing the National Grid with an eye toward saving 10 percent of the U.K.’s energy. Read: Artificial Intelligence Scientists Discuss Doomsday Plans In Arizona Desert Hassabis, who as a game designer came up with “Evil Genius,” said the company has sought input from philosophers and mathematicians, as well as from digital engineers, on how to build an AI machine that won’t run amok (think “Battlestar Gallactica”). He said the real danger would come from a self-improving “seed” that would allow AI to rewrite its source code without human oversight. “I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,” Hassabis’ partner Shane Legg said in a 2011 interview with Less Wrong. Facebook already is using AI for targeted advertising, photo tagging and curated news feeds. Microsoft and Apple use it to power Cortana and Siri. Google has always used it for its search engine. Musk has been warning about the dangers of AI for three years and invested in Deep Mind to keep an eye on the technology. He suggested last month at the World Government Summit in Dubai that the way to escape the dangers of AI would be for there to be “some sort of merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence,” suggesting a neural lace that could be injected directly into the brain to enable direct communication with computers. He told the April issue of Vanity Fair that might be possible within five years. Physicist Stephen Hawking has warned technology needs to be controlled and ways of identifying threats quickly have to be put in place. He told the Times “some form of world government” needs to be established to keep humans from destroying themselves and to keep AI from growing so powerful it could kill us off unintentionally. “The real risk with AI isn't malice but competence,” Hawking said. “A super intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble.” Bring on the Three Laws of Robotics!

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs. Google Pixel C Emily Ferron March 27, 2017 A side-by-side look at the features and specs for the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and the Google Pixel C View gallery - 23 images Before the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, "Google Pixel" meant the Google Pixel C, a high-end Android-running tablet. Samsung has just released an Android tablet of its own, the Galaxy Tab S3, with a similar price point and a few extra perks. Here's how their specs and features compare. Size Sick of Ads? Join more than 500 New Atlas Plus subscribers who read our newsletter and website without ads. It's just US$19 a year.More Information The Pixel C is a larger tablet overall – it's about 16-percent taller and 18-percent wider (when both are held in the landscape orientation). It's also about 29-percent thicker, though that's only a difference of 2.5 mm, about a tenth of an inch. Weight It makes sense that the Pixel C is heavier as well. It's about 17-percent heavier than the lightest Tab S3. Note that both the dimensions and weights given are for the tablet only, and do not take into account the optional keyboard accessories (see below). Build The Tab S3 has a glass back panel, which is classy, but might not be the most practical option for a portable device that often gets held in one hand. The Pixel C has a no-nonsense aluminum body. Colors The Tab S3 comes in black or silver; the Pixel C is available in silver only. Display size The Pixel C has a larger diagonal measurement and an unusual 1:1.4 aspect ratio. It offers about 8 percent more overall screen area than the Tab S3, which has a 4:3 aspect ratio. Display resolution The Pixel C's display has more tightly-packed pixels, which could mean a sharper viewing experience. However, pixel density alone does not determine the quality of a display. Samsung has said its Tab S3 supports HDR (high dynamic range) which should mean a more realistic contrast ratio and/or greater color gamut. However, Samsung has not specified its exact HDR standard, so it's wise to take that HDR designation with a grain of salt. Speakers The Pixel C has standard stereo speakers, but the Tab S3 adds a second pair. In a nod to multimedia needs, Samsung's quad speakers are designed to rotate sound output based on the orientation of the tablet. Fingerprint sensor Of these, only the Samsung tablet has a built-in fingerprint sensor for biometric logins. Cellular connectivity option You can pay extra for a Galaxy Tab S3 with LTE connectivity, so you can use it on your cellular data plan instead of a Wi-Fi network. There's no LTE option for the Pixel C. Keyboard support Both makers have created optional keyboards that dock into place. Unlike Bluetooth accessories, these keyboards draw power from the tablets, so they require no additional charging of their own. Keyboards are sold separately. The Tab S3 keyboard is US$130. Google has two Pixel C keyboard options, which vary in appearance, materials and screen angle options. They cost $149 each. Active stylus The Tab S3 supports active stylus input and even includes an S Pen in the box. No such luck with the Pixel C. Charging/data port Both devices opt for an (increasingly universal) USB Type C charging/data port. Processor The Tab S3's Snapdragon 820 chip handily beats the clock speeds of the NVIDIA Tegra X1 found in the Pixel C. RAM The Tab S3 has one more gigabyte of RAM than the Pixel C. Storage Originally, the Pixel C was available in 32 GB and 64 GB sizes. Nowadays, the 32 GB version is difficult to find. In the US, the Google Store is only offering the 64 GB option. MicroSD If 32 GB isn't enough storage for you, the Tab S3 also has a microSD slot for expansion up to 256 GB. Camera megapixels The Tab S3 packs in more megapixels in both its rear and front cameras. Battery The Pixel C's battery is a little larger overall, but battery life has many factors, and Samsung's estimate is a little higher than Google's. Of course, actual results may vary. Software The Pixel C launched with Android Marshmallow but has since received the Nougat update. As a Google device, it is expected to be one of the first in line for software updates, at least for the near future. The Tab S3 ships with Android Nougat as well, though it is skinned with Samsung's TouchWiz user interface. Multitasking Both tablets' software allows for some degree of split-screen multitasking, so you can use/view more than one app at a time. Release The Pixel C has been around since December 2015, while the Galaxy Tab S3 is just starting to hit shelves. Starting price These tablets sit at essentially the same entry price point. In the US, the Tab S3 starts at $599.99. The Google Pixel C, in its 64 GB size, retails for $599 through the Google Store. These prices do not include the optional keyboard accessories. The 32 GB Pixel C originally retailed for $499, but since it's no longer readily available, we're referring to the 64 GB price exclusively. At this point, it does seem as if the Tab S3 offers more compelling features – quad speakers, a stylus, microSD, a better camera – and is therefore a better value. Stock Android purists, however, may still find a place for the Pixel. We'll post more thoughts once we complete our Tab S3 review in the near future. In the meantime, check out our hands-on impressions from MWC 2017.

Contents News & Info Personalized Games Local Health Music, Sounds, & Noises Automotive/Travel Kitchen Smart Home Shopping Alexa has stolen the hearts and minds of the tech world in a way we haven't seen since the iPhone in 2007. It all started several years ago with Amazon's Echo, a smart little Bluetooth-capable speaker with a built-in audio-control interface named Alexa. Say that name—the "wake word"—and the speaker comes to life, follows commands, and replies to queries. It's been compared enough to the shipboard computer on Star Trek's USS Enterprise (even by me) that Amazon allowed "computer" as a new wake word (along with the existing options of saying "Amazon" or "Echo") to get Alexa's attention. A recent update to our Echo review shows that the original speaker is still a winner, and Alexa is found in other Amazon products—the Amazon Echo Dot and the portable Amazon Tap. It's also in the Fire TV and Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote media hubs (even the first generations)—and is moving into many others, including appliances and vehicles. It's all because of the power of Alexa. Think of Alexa as the cloud-based brain behind the Echo, akin to Siri, Cortana, or Google Now. It gets smarter and more powerful as Amazon adds features—Echo owners get a weekly newsletter spelling out those new options. Features are one thing. Skills are another. Think of them as the third-party apps you can add to Alexa, like you add apps to a smartphone. Amazon's opening up of Alexa to all developers has created a boom in skills. Over 10,000 entirely free skills are now available—up from 1,000 back in June 2016 and 7,000 in January 2017. That's a lot of growth. There is even a skill for finding new skills, appropriately named Skill Finder, and third-party ways of navigating skills (Amazon's setup is not easy), such as Alexa Skills Store. And, you can always say, "Alexa, what are your new skills?" for a run-down. Remember, all Alexa skills are free. Whether from a giant corporation or developed by a kid with some scripting knowledge, skills are not yet turning a profit for anyone directly (though Uber, Dominos, and others don't mind the money generated after you talk on their behalf). With so many to choose from, which skills are worth your time? There is a lot of useless fluff to be had with any collection of that size—and the syntax of how you verbally interact with some skills is vexing at times. However, there are also a number of aural diamonds in the digital rough. We've combed through them for this look at the best skills currently available on Alexa. Get ready to say "Alexa, activate the ______ skill"... a lot. Want some truly productive skills to help your work day? Read 23 Must-Have Alexa Skills for Your Small Business. News and Information Enabling certain news apps makes them a part of your Flash Briefing, a collection of quick news updates from favorite sources. To organize your Flash Briefing, navigate in the Alexa app to Settings > Flash Briefing, where you can remove content from a Flash Briefing or edit the order in which it's read. CNN Flash Briefing Getting the latest news with the built-in Flash Briefing feature on Alexa is an excellent way to hear the day's news as you drink your coffee or drive to work. This skill lets you add CNN's headlines and breaking stories to the briefing. Invocations: "Alexa, what's in the news?" or "Alexa, what's my Flash Briefing?" BBC Sick of "biased" news outlets in the US? Get your world news from a source I think it's safe to say we all trust (because of the English accents): the BBC World Service. This skill also becomes part of your Flash BriefingFlash Briefing, and is brought to you by the fine folks at TuneIn. Invocations: "Alexa, what's in the news?" or "Alexa, what's my Flash Briefing?" This Day in History The History Channel presents this skill to give you a run down on the big events that happened on any day in the past. Invocations:"Alexa, launch This Day in History?" or "Alexa, ask This Day in History what happened on _____" with the day of your choosing. (Follow up with "Tell me about another event" or "Hear more about this event.") Opening Bell If you're into the stock market, forget the ticker symbols. This skill lets you ask for a company, by name, to get the current stock price, as well as how much it's changed percentage-wise. (Note that the data may not be real time.) Invocations: "Alexa, ask Opening Bell for Apple" (or Microsoft, Google, Tesla, or any publicly traded company) Twitter Reader Link your Twitter account to this skill in the Alexa app; it'll read your Timeline, Retweets, Likes, Mentions, and even list out trending topics. If you want more about a trend, ask "Alexa, tell me more about trend number 5," (or whatever). Play with it and you may never need to "read" Twitter again. Invocations: "Alexa, open Twitter" "Alexa, ask Twitter for trends." "Alexa, ask Twitter for my Mentions." "Alexa, ask Twitter has anyone Retweeted me?" "Alexa, Ask Twitter for Tweets I liked." Census Data The United States census takes place every 10 years and collects a metric butt-load (that's totally a thing) of data about the country as well as individual states and all sorts of demographics. Ask Census Data for things like population, median incomes, poverty rates, etc. for states and you'll get some interesting stats. For some reason, the skill is tagged by the developer as "may not be suitable for all ages." So don't let the kids ask about income levels. Invocations: Every query has to start with "Alexa, ask census data...," such as "Alexa, ask Census Data, what is the population of Oregon?" Today's Word of the Day There are a slew of "word of the day" skills on Alexa, many of which you can integrate right into your daily Flash Briefing. This one, however, is a personally curated list of words with examples—and the highest rated such app to date in the Skills store. Invocations: "Alexa, open Today's Word of the Day." TV Shows This one is for those of you still at the mercy of the TV schedule (have you not heard of a DVR?) TV Shows can tell you when any show airs and on which network (but not the channel)—even if it's streaming on Netflix or Amazon Video. It'll even throw out a TV Guide-esque show summary. Use it to find shows that have already aired or those coming soon. Invocations: "Alexa, ask TV Shows when is _______ on next?" or "Alexa, ask TV Shows what time is _________?" The developer has more suggestions. Big Sky Big Sky does the same thing as the Dark Sky app on your smartphone (by using the same data): it gives "hyper-local" weather forecasts, better than what you get with the built-in weather functions. To make it work, however, you must create a Big Sky account, provide your home address—or any location for which you want to know the weather, pick Fahrenheit versus Celsius, and link it to the skill. Narrow the query down to weather in a certain time frame ("in two hours" or "tomorrow before noon") as needed. Invocations: "Alexa, open Big Sky." Ask for "more details" if needed. Or ask any question you can think of as long as you start with "Alexa, ask Big Sky...." Personalized Ask My Buddy Remember the classic "I've fallen! And I can't get up!" commercial? A hilarious memory for a serious subject, as personal alert services have waxed and waned over the years. You see fewer of them in the age of smartphones, but if a smartphone isn't an option, there's the Echo. With Ask My Buddy, get a spoken-word lifeline to personal responders. Link the free account you set up at www.askmybuddy.net (it'll come up when you click the Enable skill button); once the account is registered, you'll get a welcome email. Log into the account to add contacts (responders). You can then ask Alexa to alert responders one at a time by name, or all of them at once if you're deep in trouble. The responder gets an SMS text and a phone call with an automated voice telling them you asked for the alert to go out. It's no substitute for calling 911—and it won't call 911 for you—but it can't hurt to have it set up for your loved one. Once you're a member of Ask My Buddy, you'll get a monthly email newsletter with news and tips on using the service. Invocations: "Alexa, Ask My Budddy to alert Fred" (substitute the name of your responder) or "Alexa, Ask My Buddy to alert everyone." Have I been pwned? For Alexa ';--have i been pwned? is a website for checking to see if your usernames or emails have been part of any major data breaches. This skill lets you check that data by speaking your username or email when requested to receive a verbal report. Invocations: "Alexa, open have I been poned?" (Say it phonetically.) Then spell out an email or handle. Assuming she can handle your enunciation—not easy with longer email addresses—you're in business. Say "clear" to clear all text you've entered, "backspace" to go back one character, and "done" when finished. Find My Phone This skill from Trackr, maker of small Bluetooth device trackers for your keys, requires a Trackr account and the Trackr app be installed on your iPhone or Android device. Set it all up and link the account to the skill—you can do the Alexa integration in the mobile apps (a PIN is required for some security). You can then ask Alexa either to find the phone (she'll reply with the last known address for the device) or to ring the phone (it's not accessed via a phone call—if you want that try the CallMyLostPhone skill). You have to open the app to stop the ringing. Amazon likes this one enough to make it part of the Echo ad campaign (see below). Invocations: "Alexa, ask TrackR to find my phone" or "Alexa, ask TrackR to ring my phone." SMS With Molly Texting on the phone is for chumps. Get set up on Molly, and you can talk your texts right into the Alexa service. You get to send up to 30 messages a month for free with this skill, and it doesn't matter which carrier you have, though you are limited to only two receivers in your contacts list. It's easiest to enable via Amazon on the desktop. Click the Enable button; you'll visit smswithmolly.com to create an account and enter your two favorite contacts. The account is then linked to the skill. Invocations: "Alexa, ask SMS With Molly to text Jill "I'm home" or "Alexa, tell SMS With Molly to send 'I'll be late' to Hannah." Alexa will repeat the message and then ask if it's okay, as well as confirm when the message is sent. AT&T Send Message If you want to text up to 10 contacts, and you have AT&T mobile phone service, you're in luck—AT&T provides exactly that skill to its customers with an Amazon Echo. You get the ability to go to a website to link your account to the Alexa skill, then revisit later to update your contacts list. She'll repeat back what she thinks you said and send it right out without giving you a chance to delete and correct any typos (forget trying to insert punctuation). But unlike with Molly (above), the recipient will see the message as coming from your phone. Invocations: "Alexa, open AT&T" or "Alexa," ask AT&T to text John." Interview Prep Got a life-changing job interview coming up? Ask the Interview Prep skill to toss you a few queries of its own from a database of prep questions, for many different jobs. Use them to practice; your prep may make all the difference in landing the gig. Invocations: "Alexa, Ask Interview Prep for a question." Mastermind SMS with Molly is simple; Mastermind is the whole megillah. It can send and receive your texts, and will even initiate phone calls for you and announce caller IDs as calls come in. It connects not only your Android phone (iPhone support is coming), but also your PC and Chromecast to Alexa if you want to link them all. Some of them have special Mastermind apps. The skill will allow voice control to start Bluetooth on your phone, start media apps, read saved stores, even ring your phone and tablet when lost. It's almost too much to handle. This could be the beginning of skills that will cost you, as a Mastermind account is currently free—but in closed beta testing. To jump the line costs $15. Invocations: Too many to list, watch the video. Games Jeopardy! J6 Do you wish you had a way to test your knowledge of answering clues with questions? Or that Alex Trebek would stop by the house? This is as close as you get: the mythical extra "6th clue" of all Jeopardy! categories are presented to you to answer in the form of a question. Get enough right and Alexa will even tell you to try out for the show. It updates every weekday. Invocations: "Alexa, play Jeopardy!" (If you don't hear or understand the question, say "Repeat" or "I don't know.") Hunt the Yeti The classic days of Zork and Hitchhiker's Guide games are long behind us—or they were until Alexa gave us a bold new way to do a text-adventure. You tell your Echo device which way to go as the game feeds you details, trying to avoid the pits and bats that attack. It's not too advanced yet, but this is just a hint of what's to come. Invocations: "Alexa, launch Yeti Hunt Game" or "begin game" or "move north." Twenty Questions The classic game for bored riders in the car comes to Alexa. Pick something that's animal, vegetable, or mineral (or "other" if it's an abstract concept, like "love"). Keep it in your head as Alexa goes through all the questions that help her narrow down what it is. If questions seem irrelevant, you can say "skip," but that doesn't count against her 20, so there. Invocations: "Alexa, play Twenty Questions." Abra (Akinator) Pick a character in fiction or a real-life famous personality, and the Akinator will ask you a series of yes-or-no questions to narrow down who that person is in your head. Don't let the video below deter you—she guessed my Captain Jack Sparrow thought in no time. Invocations: "Alexa, launch Akinator." Question of the Day Not only do you get asked new trivia questions every day, with multiple-choice answers, you earn points if you get it right. Correct or not, you'll bolster your knowledge on the topic at hand. Activating the skill requires you to provide the developer with your name, email, and ZIP code. Invocations: "Alexa, ask question of the day." Shakespeare Insult If you must be told you suck, be told by the best. This is one of many such apps for getting the Bard to make you feel bad. The options come not only from his plays, but also some randomly generated Elizabethan-style abuse via the Shakespeare Insult Kit. Thou tickle-brained maggot-pie. Invocations: "Alexa, ask the bard to insult me" Insult Generator Issue the command to Alexa and she doesn't hesitate, she just throws out a witty bon-mot suitable for excoriating your friends and relatives and especially your enemies. Some may sound clever and original, a few are classics ("You've got a mind like a steel trap: always closed"), and a few are very to the point ("Penis" was an actual offering from this skill; so FYI, it's not suitable for all ages.) Invocations: "Alexa, open insult generator." Guess My Number Pick any number as long as it's 1 to 99. Alexa will ask questions until she gets it right, usually by asking you if it's higher or lower to narrow it down. (Don't confuse it with a whole different skill, also called Guess My Number, where instead Alexa picks the digits and gives you five tries to guess. Invocations: "Alexa, guess my number." RPG Elf Name Generator Getting ready for your elf character to storm the gates at Helm's Deep?* Then the character probably needs a name. This Alexa Skill will ask how it can help; tell it you need a male name or a female name (they don't go for non-binary elves, apparently) and you'll get a couple of Tolkien-sounding words to throw on a character sheet. (There is also a separate Elf Name Generator that provides names more in keeping with Santa's helpers, Tony Sprinkletoes.) Invocations: "Alexa Open Elf Name Generator" *There were no elves at Helm's Deep! The Magic Door The Magic Door takes the story-telling interactive adventure up a notch on Alexa, providing multiple magical world settings. Adventure options include brewing potions, helping princesses and gnomes, saving trapped monkeys, and more. This is one of the most reviewed and highly rated skills on the service. Invocations: "Alexa, open the magic door" Beat the Intro The official 10,000th skill for Alexa, this is like Name that Tune, but more for people with bad memories. Between Alexa and the host for the mobile version, Foxy, they explain the rules: you list a Six Pack of hit clips with vocals, or a TriplePlay of intros before singing starts. You have to figure out who they are as they play. Write them down. Then ask for the answers to see if you were right. It's not perfect, in that you don't get to name the acts or the tunes and get instant gratification, but the developers promise more interactivity as the skill evolves. Invocations: "Alexa, open Beat the Intro." Local StubHub You can use the Stubhub site/service to get tickets to whatever is happening in your area. You can use the Stubhub skill to find out what's happening so you can get those tickets. You don't have to limit yourself to home; ask about things happening in any city. Invocations: "Alexa, ask StubHub what's happening this weekend" or "...what's going on tonight" or "... what's happening in San Francisco?" OpenTable Booking a table online with OpenTable is pretty easy. Connect your account with Alexa and you can do it all via voice. When you enable the skill, OpenTable will take your name, ZIP, email, and phone number; then when you invoke the skill it searches for available reservations within the next 2.5 hours. Or you can narrow your search to a specific restaurant (it just has to be one that's part of OpenTable, natch). However, you can't yet search on general types of cuisine. To cancel a reservation, you have to go through the link in the confirmation email you are sent. Invocations: "Alexa, launch OpenTable." Restaurant Explorer If you do want to search by local cuisine, try Restaurant Explorer. You can spell out the ZIP code, even in other towns, to get a hint of what's available. When you hear about a good option, just ask the skill for more details. Invocations:"Alexa, ask Restaurant Explorer to find Thai food near 10016." Fandango Link your full Fandango account, then ask Alexa to open it and step you through finding theaters in your ZIP code, and she'll tell you what's playing. You can then narrow down the search to a specific film to get show times, or buy tickets if you have a Fandango VIP account (which essentially means you gave Fandango a credit card to buy tickets online). Invocations: "Alexa, Open Fandango" or "Alexa, Ask Fandango what's playing at a nearby theater" or "Alexa, Ask Fandango to search for Beauty and the Beast." Empire State Building Colors Do you live in or near New York City, and wonder just what hue the icon Empire State Building will be splashed with that night? This skill pulls the not just the color info from the ESB website, but also tells you what the hue is in honor of. Invocations: "Alexa, Ask Empire State Colors 'What's the colors?'" N.Y.C. Status Another one for New Yorkers, this skill provides multiple tidbits of info needed for surviving life in the big city. Things like when (if?) your garbage will be collected, what side of the street you are allowed to park on, and school closings, all pulled from NYC 311. If you live in a different big city, look in the Skills store to see if your municipality has something similar. Invocations: "Alexa, ask N.Y.C. Status if alternate side is in effect" or "Alexa, ask N.Y.C. Status if school's open tomorrow" or "Alexa, ask N.Y.C. Status if garbage collection is happening on April first." Health WebMD Doctors don't like when you go to WebMD and diagnose your own maladies. So instead, get the diagnosis by using WebMD on Alexa. You can ask her about drug side effects, particular diseases or conditions or symptoms, get definitions of complicated medical terms, and more. Invocations: "Alexa, open WebMD" or "Alexa, ask WebMD what are the side effects of _____?" or "Alexa, ask WebMD 'what is diabetes?'" Fitbit The official Alexa skill of the leading fitness tracker, it accesses the data on your tracker's account so you can get a verbal confirmation on how well (or poorly) you're doing. If multiple members of the household have a Fitbit, you need to set up multiple Amazon Household profiles to switch between, each with an associated Fitbit account. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Fitbit how I'm doing today" or "Alexa, ask Fitbit how I slept last night." 7-Minute Workout There are 7-minute workout apps aplenty on smartphones. You don't need any of them with Alexa in the room. She'll walk you through the standard regimen (including jumping jacks, wall sit, push-ups, lunges, squats, etc.) for the full seven. The latest update to the skill tracks your workout so if you quit in the middle, you can resume it later, plus adds images and tutorials that are accessible in the Alexa app on the phone or tablet. Invocations: "Alexa, start seven-minute workout." Life Hacks Life hacks are those little tricks that make adulting so much easier. This skill throws out quick little tips each time you open it, from making kids' toys quieter and ironing cheats to how best to swallow pills versus capsules and beyond. Open it enough times and you're bound to get a hack that changes your life. Invocations: "Alexa, open life hacks." Happy Days Sadly, this has nothing to do with Fonzie, but everything to do with making you a little happier. Open the skill and it spews inspirational platitudes calibrated precisely to make you feel a little more joyful. Invocations: "Alexa, open Happy Days." 1-Minute Mindfulness Due to an early limitation in Alexa, this skill could only do one-minute of audio at a time—but that may be all you need. Before it starts playing, Alexa will remind you to close your eyes, focus on your breath, and don't judge yourself if your mind wanders. When you activate the skill, ask for one of the different kinds of mediations. The default is one minute, but you can also ask for quick mediation, peaceful mediation, river mediation, or forest mediation. Supposedly three-, five-, 10-, 15-, or 30-minute mediations are coming. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Mindfulness for a minute mediation." Meditation Timer When you're ready to lower your stress for a few minutes or even hours, open up this skill, tell it how long you want to mediate (even for a full day!), then get busy with the mindfulness, soldier. There are three soundscapes: forest, rain, or ocean surf, with some subtle relaxing musak behind them. (It doesn't currently work with the Fire TV.) Invocations: "Alexa, open Meditation Timer." Say "Play next" to skip to different sounds. What to Expect From the experts over at our sister site Everyday Health (owned by Ziff Davis, just like PCMag), comes this skill, a companion to the What To Expect website and mobile apps. Expectant parents can ask Alexa every day for an update; she will reply with info and tips. It's all based on the due date you provide (or child's birth date if the big day has already arrived—there is info available for baby's first year). You can change your due date (there's a calculator) at any time by asking "Alexa, ask What to Expect to change my due date." For now, it only works for one pregnancy/child at a time—unless you've got twins or triplets in the oven. Invocations: "Alexa, open What to Expect" or "Alexa, ask What to Expect for my pregnancy update." Music, Sounds, Noises Acoustic Metronome Need to play on the beat? You used to need a fancy metronome, the kind of thing that sets you back $45 even today on Amazon. Nice as that looks sitting on the baby grand piano, you've already got a metronome option in any Alexa-supporting device with this skill. Pick any rate between 40 and 199 beats per minute; the beats stop after 90 seconds, but you can always ask it to repeat. Invocations: "Alexa, open metronome" and she'll ask how many beats you want, or "Alexa, ask metronome to play 60." Once playing say "Alexa, 40" or some other number to change the rhythm. Ditty Say what you want to the Ditty skill—a message to a loved one, a clever saying, whatever you like—and it'll auto-tune your words into a song and play the Ditty back for your listening pleasure. That would normally be it, but you also get the option to share the Ditty via Twitter or save it. Then in the future, you can play back your Ditty whenever you want to hear yourself sing. Invocations: "Alexa, open Ditty." Short Bedtime Story Call up this skill using a particular name—like that of your child—and Alexa will tell a personalized bedtime tale. The stories are about as short and brief as you'd expect from a stressed out, overworked parent who just wants the kids to go to sleep and doesn't have time to make up something elaborate, which gives them a charm all their own. Visit bedtime.webguild.com to set up an account, link it to your Alexa skill, and you can personalize things—even write your own bedtime stories for Alexa to repeat back to the non-sleeping kids. Invocations: "Alexa, tell BedTime Story to Eric." Radio Mystery Theater There is plenty of old-time radio available online, and Archive.org has much of the old CBS Radio Mystery Theater available. This skill will bring up a random episode of the podcast when launched. Skip repeats by saying "Alexa, next." The developers at Appbly.com have also created skills for other radio show podcasts such as Dragnet, Philip Marlow, Sherlock Holmes, and many others. Invocations: "Alexa, open Radio Mystery Theater." Ambient Noise: Thunderstorm Sounds Need a specialized, natural white noise to help you focus? Developer Nick Schwab offers up this moderate thunderstorm to help you cut through the other noise (or the silence). He also offers up Ocean Sounds, Babbling Brook, and Rain Sounds as separate skills. Invocations: "Alexa, open Thunderstorm Sounds" or "Alexa, ask Thunderstorm Sounds to loop." Earplay This is a new type of storytelling: Earplay is like a radio show, but with a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure option, where you are prompted to take the story in new directions. So far, the story choices are limited, but the popularity of this skill will probably mean expansion in the future. (Not all stories are suitable for all ages. Parental discretion is advised.) Invocations: "Alexa, start Earplay." Automotive/Travel Translated Open Translated (brought to you by professional translation service Translated.net) on Alexa. Say what you want to say, pick a language, and the skill replies with the translation you need so you can say it aloud. She'll even slow down or speed up as you require to help with understanding, or just say "Repeat" to hear it again. Translated works with 36 languages. Pirate is not one of them. Invocations: "Alexa, open Translated" or "Alexa, ask Translated to say 'where is the bathroom' in Welsh." Automatic If you're a car fanatic, you may use Automatic—it's like a fitness tracker for automobiles. It plugs into the ODB port under the dash, collecting all sorts of diagnostic data—plus tracks where the car's going using GPS. With this skill, you can ask Alexa for information about your car, like whether it needs gas, how far it's been driven, and especially where it's currently located. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Automatic if I need gas" "Alexa, ask Automatic where my car is." Alexa, ask Automatic how far I drove last week." Uber Your feelings toward Uber may be complicated, but there is no denying it's the leading rideshare service. This skill—which supports UberX, UberBlack, UberSUV, UberXL, and UberSelect—lets you set your Alexa location as a default for calling a car. You can also tell Alexa to change the default location, cancel a ride you've called, or ask for the status of the ride. Switching Amazon Household accounts on the Alexa lets other people use their own Uber account. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Uber for a ride." Lyft Eschew Uber for a Lyft. This skill does what you'd expect—gets you a car—but also can provide an estimate for the cost and or length of time of a Lyft between a couple of preset locations in your Lyft account ("home" and "work," specifically), and use it to rate drivers. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Lyft for a ride." Kayak Our favorite mobile app/site for travel (we give it five stars) is a featured skill for the Amazon Alexa. You can set or change your home airport using Alexa, and search on a number of things from flights (it helps to know the flight number) to rental cars to places to go on a budget. You don't need a Kayak account to enable it. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Kayak how much it is to fly from New York to Los Angeles" or "Alexa, where can I fly for one-thousand dollars" or "Alexa, when does the next flight from Miami land in Newark?" MyFord Mobile This one is for a limited audience of owners of Ford plug-in vehicles (the C-Max Energi, Fusion Energi, and Focus Electric as of this writing). But it's incredibly handy if you do, letting you ask Alexa to do a wide variety of things: start the car, stop the car if it's running, lock or unlock it, get the odometer reading, get the range the vehicle can go on the current charge (or gas), even check the state of the battery charge or the tire pressure. Invocations: "Alexa, open MyFord Mobile." My ETA The ETA—estimated time of arrival—is the most important estimate any traveler (or those who await a driver's arrival) can make. This skill, which pairs with an account you create at MyETAserv.com, will let you use to Alexa to pre-determine the ETA from your home to a number of pre-set locations. You never, ever need to be late to work, school, the airport, or the bar ever again. Invocations: "Alexa, open My ETA and tell me the list of my destinations" or "Alexa, ask My ETA for the time to drive to work." Kitchen My Chef – Kitchen Assistant by Chefling Chefling makes mobile smartphone apps to help you "monitor, organize, and select your food." This skill brings those abilities to the Amazon Echo, so you can use it as more than just a glorified timer if it sits in your kitchen. You'll want to embrace the use of the apps to get the most out of it, but if you're diligent about entering the food you've got or need, you will likely be working with much fresher ingredients in your kitchen. Invocations: "Alexa, ask My Chef what's expiring" or "Alexa, open My Chef." Allrecipes Anyone who's ever searched the internet for a recipe knows about Allrecipes—they're all there! This Alexa skill promises hands-free access to the 60,000+ recipes on the site. Alexa can also send the recipe you're using to your phone (for that you have to link your accounts and your phone number to the skill). The number of options you can ask for with the skill are numerous; when you're ready to cook, just say "Alexa, start cooking" and then give her a "Next," "Skip," or "Repeat" as necessary. Invocations: "Alexa, open Allrecipes." "Alexa, find me a cake recipe" "Alexa, find me a chocolate chip cookie recipe" "Alexa, find me a recipe with eggs, coconut milk, and chocolate." "Tell me the reviews for this recipe" "What ingredients are needed for this recipe?" "Add this recipe to my Favorites." "Send recipe to my phone." The list of prompts goes on and on and on. Food Network Watching the Food Network and getting inspired? Just call out to Alexa, and with the right info on the chef, ingredient, or name of the recipe, the Food Network skill will send you the full recipe in your email to open when needed. The skill will also tell you what's coming up next and when certain celeb chef shows will air. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Food Network for the recipes on TV right now" or "Alexa, ask Food Network for soup recipes for dinner." MySomm Need a wine recommendation to go with a special cuisine? MySomm lets you talk to "Wine Gal" (Alexa's sommelier alter ego) and get one before you head to the store. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Wine Gal to recommend a wine for ______." Domino's Pizza Domino's was the first big-name food seller to make the leap to Alexa (in time for the 2016 Super Bowl). With it you can place your pre-set easy order, place your previous order again, and get order status/tracking. You'll need a profile with Dominos.com. (If you prefer Pizza Hut, they're also an option.) Invocations: "Alexa, open Dominos and place my Easy Order" or "Alexa, ask Domino's to track my order." MeatButler There are rules when it comes to meat: temperatures need to be followed for safety and utmost deliciousness. MeatButler is your Alexa helper to ensure you know the right temperature for any kind of meaty goodness. Invocations: "Alexa, ask MeatButler to help me prepare lamb" or "Alexa, ask MeatButler the temperature for coking rare steak." Mixologist Next time you're at the bar ordering something complicated and feeling smug that you've probably bested the tender, don't be surprised if they invoke the name of Alexa. This skill gives up the good on recipes for just about any drink—it'll even send a "home card" list of all the ingredients to the account holder's Alexa app or even Fire TV. You can also get random drink recipes, or find a drink to make based on the ingredients you have on hand. Invocations: ""Alexa, ask Mixologist 'How do I make an Old Fashioned?'" or "Alexa, ask Mixologist to surprise me." or "Alexa, ask Mixologist 'What cocktails can I make with rum?'" Smart Home Hue If you bought into the connected lightbulb world, you likely went with the Philips Hue brand. This skill makes it possible to interact with all those smartbulbs by talking rather than tapping on your phone. It even has full support for "scenes," where you can set up a location for the utmost support of what you want, such as "relax" or "sleep" or "active." You'll need to set up most of the details in the apps, then use your voice to activate or deactivate what you want. Invocations: "Alexa, discover devices" or "Alexa, turn on living room lights" or "Alexa, dim bedroom lights to 50 percent." LIFX Optimized for Smart Home There are a couple of LIFX skills for Alexa; the basic one, which you need to change light colors, and this one, which allows for more natural language control (no "ask LIFX" in the commands required). After you set things up on all your LIFX bulbs using the mobile app and connect this skill to your account, you can start turning lights on and off and adjusting brightness or turning on preset "scenes." Invocations: "Alexa, turn on the bedroom light" or "Alexa, set kitchen light to 50 percent" or "Alexa, turn on mood lighting." SmartThings Samsung's push into smart homes, SmartThings, involves an app controlling a hub that controls a bunch of smart devices—lights, sensors, locks, switches, thermostats, and more. If you own the SmartThings Hub and an Echo, connect them to control most of your house or apartment by voice. It supports "routines" (like Scenes with the smart bulbs); for example, create one like "Good Morning" that activates several items (kitchen lights and a coffee maker on a smart outlet). You just have to know the right thing to say; the list of possible invocations for this one is enormous and varied, limited only by your imagination and the number of smart devices in your home. Invocations: "Alexa, turn on the bedroom light" "Alexa, dim the hall lights" "Alexa, turn on the bedroom fan" "Alexa, set kitchen temperature to 72 degress" "Alexa, lock the front door" "Alexa, is the back door locked?" "Alexa, turn on Party Time" And on and on. Vivint.SmartHome - Basic Vivint, like SmartThings, controls plenty of devices to keep your house feeling smart as a whip—all of them devices you get from Vivint and professionally installed. We gave it an Editors' Choice award. Controlling that system through an Amazon Echo or other Alexa device is easy, and Vivint provides two skill options: the Basic, which lets you control lights, thermostats, and locks; or the Complete, which is for Vivint SkyControl subscribers but adds control to security systems, garage doors, cameras, and even lets you set the state of an entire house (with states you preset like "sleeping" or "on vacation.") Basic allows more natural language; with Complete you have to invoke "Alexa, ask Vivint to..." for each command. Vivint suggests subscribers enable both for complete coverage. Invocations: "Alexa, turn on my lights." "Alexa, are my lights on? " "Alexa, arm security system to "away." "Alexa, turn heat to 70 degrees." "Alexa, close my garages." "Alexa, I am leaving." "Alexa, I am home." And many more. Harmony – Optimized for Smart Home If you've got a Harmony Elite, Harmony Companion, or Harmony Hub at home, you know the joys of controlling everything about your entertainment system from one controller. Logitech makes two skills for the Harmony; a smart home version with more natural language options and a version where you have to say "Alexa, ask Harmony." Once they're active, you can use your voice to turn on the TV, consoles, or media streaming devices, jump to streaming services, pause a movie, adjust volume, and more. Right now you can't use your voice to control the smart home devices that are also run by the Harmony. Invocations: "Alexa, turn on the TV" "Alexa, turn off the TV" "Alexa, tell Harmony to pause" "Alexa, tell Harmony to skip forward" "Alexa, tell Harmony to increase volume" "Alexa, tell Harmony to set a sleep timer for 15 minutes." There are more. Wemo If you own the Wemo Switch, Wemo Insight Switch, and Wemo Light Switch, stop using the phone to activate and deactivate them. Link the Wemo skill, let it verify it's got the right home full of Wemo equipment, Alexa can then discover your devices and easily turn each one on/off by name. Group the devices and you can tell Alexa to turn them all off/on at once. Invocations: "Alexa, discover devices" and "Alexa, turn on/off my _______." Nest While there are a number of Nest products like cameras and smoke detectors, this skill pairs up your Alexa to provide voice control over the popular and award-winning Nest Smart Thermostat, currently in its third generation. You need to know the name of the location where you put the thermostat(s)—you invoke that location with each command (just saying "thermostat" doesn't do the job). Not all commands work on all the older Nest devices. Invocations: "Alexa, set downstairs Nest to 72 degress" or "Alexa, increase master bedroom temperature by 4 degrees." Plex Plex is server software you can run at home, so you can play back all your video and music files on any other device you want. It's our Editors' Choice for media servers—and it's totally free. Once you've set it up, enable the Plex skill and you can start using Alexa to control playback on a number of Plex players, including Android and iOS devices, Apple TV, Windows/Windows Phone, Roku, PlayStation 4, and of course Amazon Fire TV and Fire tablets. Every command has to start with "Alexa, ask [or 'tell'] Plex to..." Invocations: "Alexa, ask Plex to switch my default server" "Alexa, ask Plex to Play (or pause, resume, stop) ________" "Alexa, ask Plex to shuffle music by ________" "Alexa, ask Plex what's been recently added" "Alexa, tell Plex I don't know what to watch." AFTVnews has a full list of commands. Shopping 1-800-Flowers When you don't have time to hit the local florist, an overnight from 1-800-Flowers could still save your bacon. Connect your 1-800-Flowers account to the skill, then use your voice to make the order. Narrow it down to a specific date or even a specific type of arrangement of posies. Invocations: "Alexa, ask 1-800-Flowers to order Chloe flowers" or "Alexa, tell 1-800-Flowers I want to send flowers to Chandra on May 28th" or "Alexa tell 1-800-Flowers I need a large Love and Romance arrangement for Evan." Amazon Restaurants Amazon Prime members in select major US cities get access to Amazon Restaurants, a part of Prime Now, which is all about getting fast deliveries. Activate this skill, and you'll be given suggestions based on your previous order history with local eateries about what to order again, then you can place the order entirely through the Echo device. Invocations: "Alexa, order from Amazon Restaurants." Bargain Buddy Deal of the day sites like Woot and Meh are fantastic, but hard to always keep up with. If you've got a favorite, ask Bargain Buddy, via Alexa, to tell you what today's deal is, and you'll know whether you should go check it out. You can narrow it down on the Woot categories, by saying "Open Bargain Buddy and tell me about the Sport Woot" or the "Tools Woot," "Home Woot," Wine Woot," whatever you're into. Invocations: "Alexa, ask Bargain Buddy for the Woot" or "Alexa, ask Bargain Buddy to tell me today's Meh deal."

Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Brian Feroldi (TMFBargainBin) Mar 27, 2017 at 5:26PM A great business is extremely difficult to disrupt. Competition has the tendency to drive down profits, but a great business can buck this trend. A competitive advantage isn't enough; the best businesses have durable competitive advantages, what Warren Buffett calls an economic moat. Trying to beat a company with a moat isn't impossible, but it's often not worth the cost. We asked three of our contributors to each discuss a company that fits the above description. Here's why Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Waste Management (NYSE:WM) are three of the best businesses, and the best stocks, we've ever seen. A toll bridge on global commerce Brian Feroldi (Mastercard): While there are a lot of great business models in existence, I must admit that Mastercard's is the one I most admire. Mastercard plays a crucial role in connecting merchants, customers, and financial institutions together to enable digital commerce. In exchange for its services, Mastercard takes a small swipe off of each transaction. With trillions of dollars flowing through its network each year -- yes, trillions -- those small fees add up to the tune of more than $10 billion in annual revenue. All that revenue is wonderful, but what I really love about Mastercard's business is its operating leverage. In essence, this means that Mastercard's costs are largely fixed, so processing one more transaction costs the company next to nothing. Thus, every additional transaction that the company can incentivize on its network almost turns into pure profit. Since consumers have been ditching cash and checks in favor of credit and debit cards for years, Mastercard's profit margin has skyrocketed. MA Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Looking ahead, I see no reason for this trend to change. While credit and debit cards are ubiquitous in developed markets, they only represent 15% of global transactions. That suggests that this company has decades of room left for revenue and profit growth. If true, then Mastercard's stock stands a good chance at continuing to thump the market from here. That's why I've made this company one of my biggest personal holdings and have no intention to sell my shares anytime soon. An incredible technology company Tim Green (Alphabet): The amount of cash that Alphabet's Google throws off is made even more impressive by the fact that the company is still growing at a double-digit rate. Revenue from Google grew by 20% in 2016 to $89.5 billion, with the business producing operating income of $27.9 billion. While Google does face threats, ranging from social media companies like Facebook to e-commerce giant Amazon, the company's products are so deeply embedded in people's lives that upending its business model would be a herculean task. Google dominates search, leaving its competitors fighting over the scraps. Products like Gmail, Maps, and the Chrome browser have become the standards, giving Google a massive base of users. Google's Android mobile operating system powers more than 85% of all smartphones sold, and its Chromebooks now account for more than half of all U.S. classroom devices sold. All of this feeds into it advertising business and its cloud computing business. Image source: Alphabet. The success of Google allows Alphabet to subsidize its moon shots. From self-driving cars to internet access delivered via balloons, Alphabet is betting billions that one of these long-shot ideas will take off. Many will lead nowhere, but the potential of each idea is enormous. Alphabet is one of the most successful companies in history, and that success has been sustained by significant competitive advantages. Even if none of Alphabet's moonshots pay off, the company should continue to thrive well into the future. The best kind of business: The ones you use daily but never even consider  Tyler Crowe (Waste Management): I think of some of the best businesses to be in are the ones that we don't consider on a daily basis. Those day-to-day tasks we take for granted and think nothing of paying for the service. Is there anything that fits that description better than handling our refuse? Companies that collect and properly dispose of our trash are incredibly valuable services that we barely notice. Behind the scenes, though, it is a business that has more competitive advantages than one can count. That's what makes Waste Management the kind of company that leaves me in awe of its business model.  The most obvious advantage a waste handling industry has is geography and regulations. The ability to open up a new landfill for proper waste disposal faces mountains of regulatory scrutiny as well as the "not in my backyard" mentality of local communities. So those companies that can get a landfill up and running have near-monopolistic reign over a particular region. If that weren't enough, it's extremely capital intense to build and maintain a fleet of collection vehicles. These types of strategic benefits keep competition low in specific regions and give those operating in a particular community incredible pricing power.  For investors in Waste Management, it has translated this economic moat into a value-generating machine. While no one will ever be blown away with the company's growth rates, it continues to generate gobs of free cash flow that is used to buy back stock and increase dividend payments. These sorts of shareholder-friendly initiatives have made Waste Management an incredible stock to hold for decades at a time.  WM Dividend data by YCharts. It's hard to disrupt a well-entrenched business in the waste-handling industry, and that makes Waste Management a stock that should tug at the heartstrings of long-term investors.

LastPass Working on Fix for Newly Discovered Bug GO Google researcher Ormandy found yet another bug Mar 27, 2017 21:44 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google researcher Tavis Ormandy has put folks over at LastPass to work again after spotting yet another bug in the service.  After reporting a number of serious flaws in the password manager over the past week, this weekend Ormandy had another revelation. "I had an epiphany in the shower this morning and realized how to get codeexec in LastPas 4.1.43. Full report and exploit on the way," he wrote on his Twitter account. Ormandy, a member of Google's Project Zero security team, is known for his knack for finding serious vulnerabilities in various services we all use, including this password manager that's supposed to be safe. This is the second weekend in a row that LastPass engineers have to spend fixing bugs discovered by Ormandy. "This attack is unique and highly sophisticated. We don't want to disclose anything specific about the vulnerability or our fix that could reveal anything to less sophisticated but nefarious parties. So you can expect a more detailed post mortem once this work is complete," the firm said on the matter. They added their thanks to Tavis and other people like him who help them raise the bar for online security with LastPass. Ah-ha, I had an epiphany in the shower this morning and realized how to get codeexec in LastPass 4.1.43. Full report and exploit on the way. pic.twitter.com/vQn20D9VCy — Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) March 25, 2017 The nitpickers  Because the Internet is what it is, many people got upset with Tavis over sharing that he found another bug in LastPass. In fact, many called him out on sharing the news over Twitter, saying all this does is cause fear and uncertainty. Of course, that couldn't be farther from the truth. All services face vulnerabilities and all of them get patched up sooner or later. It's probably safe to say that all online services have security vulnerabilities at all times, but they simply go undiscovered. Therefore, Ormandy saying that LastPass had a bug wasn't exactly that big of a deal, especially since he didn't disclose what the problem was specifically or how to exploit it, which would have pushed hackers to act. Many companies have a 90-day disclosure rule set for this type of situations. These services have to find a way to patch things up within that timeframe, regardless of how serious the bug is. With researchers pointing out online that they've discovered a vulnerability, companies have that much more incentive to get to work on finding a fix. #LastPass#Google#Tavis Ormandy#vulnerability subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Says It Fixed Vulnerabilities Detailed in WikiLeaks Docs Years Ago LastPass Chrome & Firefox Extensions Affected by Critical Bug Nest Dropcams Can Be Taken Down via Bluetooth Vulnerabilities Cisco Says CIA Can Exploit 318 of Its Switches, Promises Fix Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Samsung Store in Singapore Catches Fire Ahead of Galaxy S8 Unveil All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update RTM Right Now Survey: 93% of Millennials Aren't Quitting Uber Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Latest Black Lab Linux Weekly Build Optimizes Swap File Management for SSD Windows 10, the Only Way to Go: 8 in 10 Companies to Install the OS, Study Shows    LastPass has a new bug Related Apps hide.me VPN: An easy to configure VPN client for Windows that enables you to hide your real identity while navigating online by connecting to a VPN server Metasploit Community: Penetration testing tool for security professionals that lets them run a discovery scan, bruteforce attack and exploit in order to detect vulnerabilities within a user-defined network range Metasploit Pro: This is a versatile and effective application that prevents data breaches with real-world attack scenarios and verifies security effectiveness SecureSafe: A comprehensive online storage solution that allows you to keep your files and passwords protected thanks to a high level of data encryption KPEnhancedEntryView: Enhance the accessibility of KeePass Password Safe by adding extra display elements to your window with this straightforward plugin Zemana AntiLogger: Make sure that your private data will remain private by using this software application that prevents harmful applications from damaging your computer ApexSQL Decrypt: A decryption tool for SQL Server database objects, be them functions, procedures, views or triggers, which enables you to preview the original DDL scripts Reader comments Encrypted Mail Tutanota Gains 500K Users in 3 Months, Celebrates Privacy Era more on: Tutanota i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

It's been over a year since the accident and the homeowners still can't move back in due to disputes over who should cover the costs. by Rick Rothacker, The Charlotte Observer / March 27, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) --Nearly 18 months ago, a contractor installing Google Fiber struck a sewer line in the University area and created a ghastly mess, according to a lawsuit making its way through Mecklenburg County Superior Court.   Raw sewage flooded a nearby house, and more than a year later the homeowners still can’t move back in amid a dispute over who will pay for the clean-up, according to the suit. RELATEDGoogle Accelerates Fiber Construction in San AntonioGoogle Fiber Delays San Jose Rollout The case is an extreme example of the damage that can occur as contractors build high-speed networks around the city. The suit also highlights the multiple parties involved in installing these systems – and the blame that can get passed around when something goes wrong. Nancy Troutman and William Jamison, a married couple with a young daughter, are suing Google Fiber, three contractors that worked with the technology giant and their homeowners insurance company, according to the complaint filed in August 2016. One of the contractors responded with its own suit against the city of Charlotte and the company charged with marking utility lines before any digging began. “It’s been quite challenging for them,” said Jeremy Foster, a Charlotte attorney representing the couple. “There is still bacteria and mold in the house. They have been out for a year and a half.” Until the suit is resolved, the couple lacks the money to make necessary repairs, Foster said. A mediation session is scheduled for Tuesday, according to court records. Many in Charlotte rejoiced when Google Fiber and AT&T announced plans in recent years for new networks that promise speeds up to 100 times faster than traditional broadband. But the massive, street-by-street construction project has proved messy for some homeowners. The Observer reported in February that the city has sent contractors bills for more than $688,000 in repairs made to damaged water mains, cracked streets and other city property. The cost to private citizens isn’t known. According to the suit filed by Troutman and Jamison, the contractors that did the work near their house worked for FTE Networks, which was partnering with two other contractors, Bechtel Infrastructure and S&N Communications. On Oct. 23, 2015, FTE workers struck and damaged an underground “sewer lateral” located on Charlotte property directly in front of the home on Saxonbury Way, according to the suit. The house was flooded with an inch and a half of raw sewage, the suit says. The city made repairs, but their home was exposed to “toxic substances,” including raw sewage, the suit says. “The plaintiffs and their daughter were forced to move from their home as a result of the contamination,” the complaint states. Adding to their troubles, the couple’s insurance company, QBE, would only pay $10,000 under their homeowners’ policy, according to the complaint. The damages, however, “far exceed $10,000 and the home cannot be made livable for $10,000,” the suit says. QBE has said the $10,000 would also apply to any additional living expenses, including hotel stays, according to the suit. The complaint seeks damages from the contractors and QBE, including punitive damages form the insurance company. Google wouldn’t comment. Attorneys for FTE Networks, Bechtel, S&N and QBE did not respond to a request for comment. In response to the suit, FTE in November filed a complaint against the city and the company that it hired to mark utility locations, One Call Concepts Locating Inc. As a result of One Call’s alleged failure to mark the sewer line, FTE “struck and damaged the sewer lateral which allegedly resulted in the damages to the plaintiffs,” FTE’s complaint states. In court filings, the city of Charlotte said damages suffered by the homeowners were caused solely by One Call Concepts, while One Call Concepts has asked the court to dismiss the counter-claim. The city of Charlotte wouldn’t comment on the litigation. An attorney for One Call did not respond to a request for comment. Foster, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said he hopes for a quick resolution. “For their sake, hopefully it will get resolved,” he said, “so they can get their house fixed and move back into it.” ©2017 The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.)

With version 5.8, you can enter a word to be translated, and a new “Definitions” section appears at the bottom of the page below the usual “Alternate translations” section. For now, the feature seems pretty limited. For instance, translating the word “caballero” from Spanish to English will correctly translate to “gentleman” and provide definitions for that word. But if you try to translate “el caballero” (or any phrase with more than one word), the app will only provide the direct translation and no other information. Interestingly, the definitions are provided in the source language. So if you’re translating from Spanish to English, the definitions will be in Spanish. Account switcher Most Google apps at this point have a quick account switcher, but until today, Google Translate was one of the few that didn’t (see comparison below). In Google Translate 5.8, you can open the hamburger menu and change accounts just as you would in apps like Google+ or Gmail. Before: Translate 5.7 After: Translate 5.8 The benefit of this is that you can easily switch between your Translate data separated across different accounts, such as personal and Google Apps work accounts. Google Translate has some features that are more complex than just straight translations (for example, the ability to save Translations to your “Phrasebook”), and now you can switch between your different sets of data with a single tap. China? We also found some new strings relating to China, but we’re not sure exactly what they mean at this point (we’ll update this post if/when we find out). Beyond these things, it’s pretty easy to assume that this app also packs the usual bug fixes that pretty much every app update has. You can get Google Translate 5.8 on the Play Store (it should be rolling out right now), and if it’s not quite available, you can also grab it from APKMirror.

How fraudsters are gaming online lenders TD and Moven extend partnership to U.S. BBVA joins Linux Foundation's blockchain project BankThink A community banker's fintech 'aha' moment search goes here Could Google give fintech apps a needed boost? By Mary Wisniewski Published March 27 2017, 4:30pm EDT More in Fintech Underbanked PFM Bank technology Google Print Email Reprints Share Share on Fintech companies that have developed products for the underserved have a big challenge — reaching their intended customers. Google and the Center for Financial Services Innovation are hoping to change that. The tech giant and CFSI, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting financial health, have been collaborating on ways to help customers wade through financial apps in the Google Play store. They are also trying to guide developers on building better consumer tools. “The big vision is to help bridge the gap in the underserved community and bring the best financial tools to help them manage their day-to-day" finances, said Ashraf Hassan, partner development manager at Google Play. The partnership started with CFSI’s innovation lab, where startups focused on improving the financial health of their users come to grow. Although Google Play was there to provide technical support and mentorship, it and CFSI decided to work together on advice for developers. The guide, which was published in a post on the Android Developers blog, is part practical, part philosophical. There is advice on using Android notifications to keep users engaged, but there are pointers like those that remind developers that English might not be the user’s first language. The guidelines also stress six principles: know your consumer; focus on access; establish and maintain trust; thoroughly test the app; drive positive user behavior; and recognize the value of mutual respect. “The big vision is to help bridge the gap in the underserved community and bring the best financial tools to help them,” says Ashraf Hassan, partner development manager at Google Play. And for apps that already embody those principles, Google Play has launched a dedicated page in its store to help ease the discovery process for app shoppers. For Google Play, the partnership with CFSI marks the tech company’s foray into financial health as the area heats up. Besides fintechs targeting personal financial management, banks have increasingly been touting such tools as a way to build engagement and remain competitive. For CFSI, the partnership helps spread its message to Android app developers, with the much bigger goal of helping to improve consumers’ financial health through a device that is used on the go. And the market for such products is huge, specifically for those not in the financial mainstream because many of those same people are overly reliant on smartphones. Indeed, smartphones usage is disproportionately higher among low-income individuals, people of color and young people. “Millions of people around the globe have limited or no access to basic financial services to enable them to manage their day-to-day finances or prepare for financial shocks,” Google Play and CFSI note in the guidelines. “Mobile technology can help bridge this gap by connecting historically underserved consumers with high quality tools that will best help them improve their financial health.” But to realize the mobile opportunity, consumers need to know what apps exist. It’s easy to search for an app if you know the company’s name. But the task could easily become overwhelming if you’re searching for “finance” in an app store and getting hundreds and hundreds of options without much context. “It becomes easier to find the product or service or platform you want based on the needs you have,” John Thompson, senior vice president at CFSI, said in an interview. The categorization of apps is something Thompson would like to see more of from platforms in order to help tackle a thorny challenge: consumer awareness of unknown fintech brand names. “There’s an opportunity to make discovery a little bit easier based on need,” Thompson said. Currently, Google Play’s new app page labeled “improve your financial health” is designed to help do that. On the page, Google Play features roughly 40 financial-health apps, including Venmo and Digit, and the tech company arranges the niche apps in rows by consumer needs, such as “build your nest egg” and “track your credit score.” Stessa Cohen, research director at Gartner, sees Google Play’s financial-health page as a consumer-friendly way to understand what apps would help them accomplish what goal. “It looks simple,” Cohen said. “You need some organization. It’s why libraries exist.” To be sure, the Apple App Store has a similar finance page that can be accessed via its categories tab. It also has providers segmented by types. For instance, tax tools are currently displayed at the top. Still, simplifying discovery isn’t a slam dunk for getting consumers to engage with their money on their smartphones. Even if consumers find the financial-health page, they would still need to settle on an app among a shopping mall of options. Even with categories, the amount of options is still "asking a lot for a consumer who is saying, Can you lead me out of the jungle of personal finance," said Mark Schwanhausser, director of omnichannel financial services at Javelin Strategy & Research. It’s noteworthy that Google Play’s financial health page has almost no bank presence. The few exceptions are ancillary apps like Level One, a money-management app owned by Capital One, or the neobank Simple, which is owned by BBVA. Other apps featured, like Digit and Moven, require relationships with banks to use the digital service or product. Joel Newman, partner development manager of Google Play, said the tech company is highlighting apps with a specific focus while most traditional bank apps are broader. Sure, traditional bank app may offer the same kind of feature as one of the highlighted financial health-related apps but that feature won’t be the core value proposition as the apps are multipurpose in nature. However, Newman says bank apps could get featured in the store’s financial health page so long as they are narrower in focus. Zelle, big banks' version of Venmo, for instance, could potentially fit into the remittance section, he said. Google Play plans to add more apps into the page and is in talks with CFSI on how to expand their partnership and have more impact, including raising awareness of apps globally. According to a recent report from Strategy Analytics, 88% of all smartphones run Google’s operating system globally. “We see CFSI as the first step in a broader focus on financial health,” Newman said.

The “data” in the IBM story is in management and analytics.  IBM executives boast their cloud strategy was built by and for data scientists – or as I like to think of it, the profession formerly known as statisticians.  The data scientist uses mathematics, statistics, and various other disciplines to extract insights and knowledge from both structured and unstructured data.  Applicable buzzwords for the data scientist include machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, and visualization, according to Wikipedia. Having a strategy and tools to dig through data, aka Big Data, is the practice and domain of data scientists.  The hottest tool in IBM's toolbox is artificial intelligence (AI), with Watson center stage.  Watson can be accessed in a variety of ways, starting with APIs to call specific functions, including language translation, natural language understanding, personality insights, speech to text, text to speech, image recognition, and various forms of analytics. Developers can start with Watson APIs to build applications to pull information from unstructured data, tap into GitHub-based code for examples, and move onto building more elaborate programs.  Turn-key IBM Watson services represent the highest value, as they are ready to use, no programming required services where a Watson cognitive machine/age is already assembled and trained to work on a particular problem set.  For example, IBM Watson Analytics provides a guided data analysis and automatic data visualization service that has the ability to quickly discover patterns and meaning in data.  The tool uses natural language processing to enable a dialog between the user and Watson, with heavier analysis performed on the fly. Vertical applications represent the pinnacle of Watson services, where the AI has been specifically trained to deal with a specific area of knowledge or skill by subject matter experts.   Watson has been trained and is being used to focus on areas such as music preference discovery; regulatory compliance in the financial, engineering and energy industries; and assisting in physical and mental healthcare. Cybersecurity is a prime example where IBM is “drinking its champagne.”  IBM's security practice uses Watson today to quickly detect and define cyberattacks, reducing the time an enterprise security analyst would need to do the work from hours to minutes.  Proactively, IBM has released the MaaS360 Advisor, enabling enterprises to use machine learning to analyze devices on the corporate network.  Once the data is gathered, the cognitive assistant provides recommended policies, patches, and customized best practices to better manage and protect those devices. The key to IBM's data strategy is the synergistic nature of each part when all three are put together. The cloud is good, “Big Data” analysis benefits come from being able to look at everything quickly and easily stored on the cloud, and AI provides the tools to rapidly analyze and exploit that data.  Developers and VARs alike need to start thinking about how to best leverage IBM's strategy for their own businesses. If you’d like to learn more about AI, be sure to check out TMC and Crossfire Media’s newest conference and expo, Communications 20/20, happening July 18-20 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The event will focus on the next wave of technology and innovations that will transcend the importance of person to person contact, disrupting the future of the entire communications industry. Find out more HERE.

The situation developed after an advertiser company working for the Guardian used Google’s AdX ad exchange to promote the newspaper subscription service. Following @thetimes investigation into online advertising, @guardian pulls ads from @youtube. This is why: pic.twitter.com/SqpnAxUiNM — Alexi Mostrous (@AlexiMostrous) March 16, 2017 The Guardian was warned of the situation last Thursday and quickly pulled their ads from Google's platform. As stated by Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer of Guardian News & Media: “We needed to react very, very quickly. We knew the next day that our brand, which is fundamentally important to us, was about to be splashed over the Times front page for all the wrong reasons.” But David Pemsel, the Guardian’s chief executive, went further and urged other brands to also blacklist Google-based ads until the company acts to guarantee this sort of ad misplacement won't happen again in the future. The result was a huge advertiser boycott that has already led more than 250 companies away from Google's ad platform. Here is a list of some of the biggest advertisers from the US and the UK who are no longer advertising with Google: UK US Argos Audi Aviva Havas Group UK (brands managed by the agency include Dominos Pizza, O2, Royal Mail, BBC, and Hyundai Kia) Heinz Honda HSBC ITV L'Oreal Lloyd's Bank Marks & Spencer McDonald's RBS Sainsbury's Tesco The Guardian Toyota Transport for London UK Government Volkswagen AT&T Beam Suntory Inc. Dish Network Enterprise FX Networks General Motors GSK Johnson & Johnson PepisCo Starbucks Verizon Walmart Following the Guardian's action, a Google's spokesman released the following statement promising to make the necessary changes to deal with the situation: “We accept that we don’t always get it right, and that sometimes, ads appear where they should not.

YouTube was initially expected to have a $10.2 billion revenue for 2017, but updated projections estimate a reduction of about 7.5% of that amount, or $750 million.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 March 2017 by Military News Ad Fraud America: The Real Scale of the Problem and How To Fix It NEW YORK, March 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Almost a quarter of the money US brands spent on digital video and display advertising in 2016 may have been wasted on fraudulent placements, according to a new study from The&Partnership and Adloox. Fact Sheet: http://multivu.prnewswire.com/prnehost/PIV855086AdFraudUS.pdf The study, ‚Ad Fraud America: The Real Scale of the Problem and How to Fix It’, is part of a global report which has contributed to an exodus of advertisers from Google and YouTube over the past week – with brands including AT&T, Verizon, the UK government and the Guardian withdrawing spend from the platform amidst fears surrounding brand safety and fraudulent placements. The&Partnership’s study reveals that the scale and cost of advertising fraud may until now have been significantly under-reported. Of the $32.17bn[1] spent on digital video and display advertising in the US alone in 2016, it estimated, a full $7.52bn (23%) may have been wasted on fraudulent advertising – approximately the same figure that the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) two years ago predicted would be lost globally to ad fraud in 2016.[2] In 2017, if US digital video and display spend grows to $37bn as forecast[3], the money US brands stand to lose could rise to $9bn. According to The&Partnership, this vast proportion of wasted spend could be reduced to single figures using specialist, third-party ad verification software – a critical element in the protection of brands which, until now, „walled gardened” platforms such as Google and YouTube have refused to allow – instead offering advertisers their own proprietary brand safety tools. Johnny Hornby, Founder of The&Partnership, said: „Having highlighted the problem, it’s important to also highlight the solution. The proper use of ad verification software can reduce the 23% of advertising spend that may be being wasted on fraudulent – often reputation-threatening – advertising placements in the US down to 1 or 2%, if not better. „The issue, however, is that the big-platform players – and most critically YouTube, as part of the Google family – are still refusing to allow access of our ad-verification software to their platforms. Meanwhile, other platforms such as Facebook are also failing to allow us full access to their walled gardens – giving advertisers the visibility and transparency they deserve. „Without this, not only are these platforms denying our clients the clean, brand-safe environments they quite rightly demand – but advertisers also lack full transparency and visibility in terms of the money they are losing to fraudulent advertising and advertising that never gets seen. „If Google wants to see advertisers returning to YouTube in significant numbers,” said Hornby, „it is going to have to move quickly on the following two things: „Firstly, Google needs to stop marking its own homework (as Keith Weed, Unilever Global CMO, recently observed) – fully opening up its walled gardens to independent, specialist ad verification software, to give brands the visibility and transparency they deserve. „Secondly, Google will need to start looking at brand safety from completely the other end of the telescope. Instead of allowing huge volumes of content to become ad-enabled every minute, and then endeavouring to convince advertisers that the dangerous and offensive content among it will be found and weeded out, it should be presenting advertisers only with advertising opportunities that have already been pre-vetted and found to be 100% safe. „Only then will we see the advertiser exodus from Google reversed – and brands begin to trust and invest in YouTube once again.” The&Partnership and Adloox’s report was conducted across a robust 200bn daily bid requests, 4bn ad calls and 10bn ad impressions a month, for a period of 12 months.

In 2013 a British artificial-intelligence startup called DeepMind surprised computer scientists by showing off software that could learn to play classic Atari games better than an expert human player. DeepMind was soon acquired by Google, and the technique that beat the Atari games, reinforcement learning, has become a hot topic in the field of AI and robotics. Google used reinforcement learning to create software that beat a champion Go player last year. Now OpenAI, a nonprofit research institute cofounded and funded by Elon Musk, says it has discovered an easier-to-use alternative to reinforcement learning that gets rival results when it plays games and performs other tasks. At MIT Technology Review’s EmTech Digital conference in San Francisco on Monday, OpenAI’s research director, Ilya Sutskever, said that could allow researchers to make progress in machine learning faster. “It’s competitive with today’s reinforcement-learning algorithms on standard benchmarks,” said Sutskever. “It is surprising that something so simple actually works.”  Machine-learning software from OpenAI figured out how to play classic Atari games. Sutskever argues that finding new ways to have software learn to do things like play computer games or steer robots is important to making machine-learning software take on more complex tasks than just recognizing images or transcribing our speech. “If we have computer systems learn to take complicated actions in the world, then I think we would be comfortable calling them intelligent,” he said. Sutskever and colleagues tested their approach, called evolution strategies, by building software that learned to play more than 50 Atari games, including Pong and Centipede. Because it is easier to scale up the new method across multiple processors, in one hour they could train artificial players comparable to those that took a day to produce using a reinforcement-learning system published by Google DeepMind last year. It showed the same ability to learn things like the need to surface for air in the game Submarine Commander (middle frame in the animation). OpenAI’s research director, Ilya Sutskever Evolution strategies showed a similar advantage when used to take on a standard test from robotics in which software has to figure out how to make a humanoid walk in a simulated environment. It took 10 minutes to achieve results that a state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning system would need about 10 hours to attain, the researchers say.

Customer Service Chatbots Are About to Become Frighteningly Realistic Harvard Scientists Moving Ahead on Plans for Atmospheric Geoengineering Experiments The World’s Largest Artificial Sun Could Help Generate Clean Fuel The technique is a reboot of a decades-old idea about how to get learning software to try out different actions and identify the most effective ones. It is loosely inspired by how natural selection causes biological organisms to adapt to their environments. “An algorithm everybody has known about for a long time works better than most people thought,” said Sutskever. He declined to suggest specific applications of AI that might get a boost from the evolution strategies technique, saying more research is needed on its strengths and limitations. But Sutskever said that comparing the method with reinforcement learning suggested it would be better at learning to perform more complex tasks that require more steps to get a result. For that reason, Sutskever said, he believes evolution strategies will help OpenAI’s goal of creating what he calls artificial general intelligence—software that can adapt to many kinds of complex scenarios. Most researchers in machine learning don’t talk much about general intelligence, instead pursuing progress on specific, often narrowly focused problems. OpenAI’s mission statement includes a commitment to creating artificial general intelligence. Sutskever said the pace of progress in machine learning means that goal is worth thinking about now. “[It] seems far off right now but [was] way more far off five years ago,” he said. “The number of people and the amount of effort going into developing these algorithms is extremely high—things are moving forward at a very healthy pace.” Weren't able to make it to EmTech Digital?

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Advertisers squeeze Google over ads running ahead… Advertisers squeeze Google over ads running ahead of extremist YouTube content By Bill Roberson — March 23, 2017 1:10 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Buy our stuff, then enjoy this rant Google is scrambling to find a solution to a problem that could end up costing it millions in revenue. The issue? Big companies are pulling their ads from YouTube after reports that some of their marketing efforts were running ahead of videos espousing extremism and hate. A growing list of companies has joined AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and even the British government in hitting pause on YouTube ads. AT&T, which spends a billion dollars a year alone on marketing, said in a statement Wednesday that “until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms,” which, of course, includes YouTube. Google has made changes to ad placement policies and introduced new tools to avoid running squeaky-clean ads ahead of content uploaded by haters, but even they say that, so far, the system is not perfect. And basically, advertisers are saying that until it IS perfect, they’re gonna hold back on YouTube placements, which means less cash for Google, but, for viewers, it also means fewer commercial breaks. So there’s that. Scary names, scarier purposes Users of Apple’s Mac computers and iPhones may have to take a few deep breaths after a data dump from Wikileaks indicates the CIA had snooping tools for both all the way back in 2008. Forbes says the fresh load of documents, known as the Dark Matter release, shows the CIA developed a spy tool called “NightSkies” that lived at root and kernel levels in Apple’s Mac and iPhones. NightSkies reportedly would allow the CIA to completely control the devices, and that it would “beacon” on occasion to let operatives know it was functioning and ready for use. Another tool the agency developed was something called the “Sonic Screwdriver,” a bit of snoopware that ran on the firmware in a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter and could also infect a Mac with malware. Wikileaks says they are working with tech companies to blunt the effects of the spy tech revealed in its latest cache of secrets, but some tech companies say the demands Wikileaks is making are not reasonable. For what it’s worth, it appears the CIA would have to have physical access to your Mac or iPhone to install the NightSkies spyware, limiting the installation base. Still, you may want to wipe and reinstall just to be sure. So simple, yet still so addictive Ah, Pong, great-great-grandpappy of today’s video game empire. Yeah, we don’t really remember it either, but now a team that does has put an “in-real-life” spin on the classic game. That’s right, they’ve made a “physical” version of pong, called the Table Pong Project, and no, they didn’t reinvent ping-pong to do it. The physical game, which they are still working on but should look and work like this when it comes out, is the same as the video version (it uses magnets), with a few twists. It’s table-style, rather than a stand-up machine like the original, and when you’re not ponging, it works as, well, a normal coffee table…with a cool clock, LED lights and graphics. During gametime, you can charge your phone up and listen to music through built-in speakers via Bluetooth. Pretty clever. Even Pong creator Allan Alcorn gave his approval. The project is on Kickstarter right now and you’ll need to pony up $1,100 to get an early bird release. Hit this link for more info on getting your Pong on.

The best Windows 10 laptops, desktops and tablets are stuffed with apps and games, but chances are you browse the web more than anything else. Microsoft Edge is one of the operating system’s most ambitious undertakings. The company knows that you do a lot of web browsing. It’s hoping all that browsing happens in Microsoft Edge. That hope sets the battle for all the Edge vs Chrome talk you might have heard from friends and family that follow these things. Since the early 2000s, companies have battled over who can offer users the best browser. For years, Microsoft dominated web browsers with Internet Explorer. It was able to do so by installing it on nearly every machine that ran a copy of Windows. Soon it was the only browser to choose from. Seeing the success others had found in the space, Google Chrome arrived to give everyone easy access to the company’s best online web apps, like Gmail. It’s tough to decide whether to use Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome on your Windows 10 PC. Read: Best iPhone Browser: Safari vs Google Chrome Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome are locked in an epic battle. Both want to desperately be your default web browser. They each want to help you find what you’re looking for in their search engines. Both sync your tabs from across different devices with ease. Should you use Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome? Like all things technology related, it’s a little more complicated than it may seem. That being said, there is a clear winner. Edge vs Chrome: Built for You Microsoft Edge exists because Internet Explorer slowly became hated by most users. Certainly, by the time Windows 10 arrived in 2015, Microsoft had alienated enough users that it needed to start over. Despite attempts to make it more user-friendly with Windows 8, Internet Explorer’s design wasn’t particularly suited to both a mouse and touch, for example. Technologies inside the browser were long outdated. Microsoft Edge Edge uses a new engine called EdgeHTML to render web pages. Its design is flat to match the rest of Windows 10. Because it supports the latest standards that websites use, Edge is supposed to be more compatible with the websites and web apps that everyone uses today. In attempt to keep you safe, Microsoft Edge blocks pop-ups by default and has a kill switch for Adobe Flash. That’s a web plugin that used to need to be downloaded for certain sites. The browser connects directly to your Microsoft Account, meaning your browser history and favorites travel with you from PC to PC, provided you’re logged in with the same credentials. You can’t add themes to Microsoft Edge but you can make the window a dark gray for better night-time reading. Read: 10 Things You’ll Hate in Windows 10 Google Chrome is by far the most popular web browser there is. Launched in 2008, it quickly made a name for itself by being fast and stable. Frequent updates didn’t hurt either. Neither did its built-in support for Extensions. Google Chrome Its browser is available everywhere that you’d expect a browser to be. It’s the default browser on Android smartphones and has a companion app on iPhone. All the different versions of Chrome are tied together by your Google Account. As such, your favorites and browsing history are always with you. Flash is baked into the Windows version and can be turned off with just a switch. Google Chrome has theming too, something Microsoft Edge doesn’t have. Edge vs Chrome: Speed, Battery Life & Stability Speed is at the heart of any browser experience. The best browser for you might have a few features that you like, but you care more about web pages loading quickly and without issue. Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome have battled each other in speed contests and stability for a long time now. To let Microsoft tell it, Google Chrome is slightly slower than Microsoft Edge. It points to Edge’s 31427 Octane 2.0 score. Chrome scored a 28466 in that same Google-made Octane benchmark. Speed isn’t everything, though. It’s also Microsoft’s assertion that some normal activities in Microsoft Edge take longer to kill your battery than in Google Chrome. It takes the Surface Book streaming through Edge almost 9 hours to die while streaming 1080P video. Chrome dies at around 6 hours. What this speed test doesn’t show is just how unpredictable Microsoft Edge can be. Perhaps because of the new technologies behind the scenes, Microsoft Edge sometimes can’t load web pages that every other browser can. Either the entire window locks or the browser keeps trying to refresh the page until it declares it uses older web technology. When this happens, it surfaces a button that opens the page in Internet Explorer. Microsoft Edge isn’t a big fan of web pages covered with ads. It sometimes takes issue with web apps too. Google Chrome handles every web page that you can throw at it well. The browser never invites you to use another browser or fails to load a web page. It is known to become unstable the more tabs that you keep open, though. It’s not exactly battery-life friendly either. Edge vs Chrome: Extensions and Features Chrome has the best Extensions library of any browser. Developers can and have created thousands of different feature additions to the browser. Chrome Extensions can help you keep your accounts safe by integrating with lots of password management apps, LastPass being the most well-known of them. Google makes feature additions of its own, like Google Keep and Hangouts for video chatting. PushBullet will let you check your messages and track alerts from your Android smartphone on your PC. Chrome Apps lets developers create entire experiences directly in Chrome. Google Chrome Extensions. Read: Microsoft Edge Tips & Tricks: Better Browsing in Windows 10 Because it’s younger, Microsoft Edge doesn’t have a huge library of Extensions. There are just 25 available in the Windows Store today, making Chrome better than Edge for those that want to add features to their browser. AdBlock, Evernote, LastPass, Pocket and Amazon are the only notable Microsoft Edge extensions. Microsoft tries to make up for the lack of extensions with a huge number of features it thinks will improve your browsing experience. Cortana, the company’s personal assistant will automatically surface to offer you coupons and discounts as you shop. A Reading List feature makes it easy to save reading material for later. Cortana in Microsoft Edge. Read: Passwords in Windows 10: Edge, Password Managers & More There’s a built-in PDF viewer, and Microsoft plans to add eBook support to Edge when the Windows 10 Creators Update arrives for free. Sharing is baked into the app. Sending links to your friends through email or Twitter takes a few taps or clicks. The Windows 10 Creators Update will introduce tab management features so that you can save important windows for later without having them clog up your browser and drag down performance. New tab management features coming to Microsoft Edge. Both Chrome and Edge default to their own search engines, but you can easily add more. In Windows 10, you can use other browsers but using the search area in the taskbar will always open a window into Edge for some reason. Read: How to Change the Search Engine in Windows 10 to Google Edge vs Chrome: Chromecast & Cast Media The Google Chromecast Ultra allows any laptop, desktop or tablet equipped with Chrome to send video footage directly to a television set or audio to a speaker system. Say that you don’t want to continue watching your favorite program on your Surface Pro 4. You can tell Google Chrome to forward the video to a television equipped with a Chromecast device. The feature is very useful for less tech-savvy households that don’t have lots of set-top boxes at the ready. It’s only available in Chrome. The Google Chromecast Ultra Edge tries to mimic Chromecast with a Cast Media option of its own. Unfortunately, the feature can be temperamental. Finding compatible hardware to plug into your television isn’t as straight forward as it as with Chromecast. Edge vs Chrome: Which Should You Use? If you value any of the additional features that are baked into Microsoft Edge, it’s the browser that you should use. Syncing web history is effortless and you’ll always have your favorites with you. The positive impact that streaming video with the browser can have on battery life is important too. That being said, Google Chrome is the right browser for almost everyone. The companion apps for iPhone and Android make it easy to track your web history regardless of device. Its Extensions library is the best that exists today, with thousands of features just waiting to be added to your experience. More important than all of that, Google Chrome loads pages quickly and works on any website. It doesn’t make excuses for what’s going on and recommend you open another browser instead. The ease of Chromecast pushes it over the top. If you’re trying to decide between Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, chances are you’ll be in better hands with Chrome, even though you’re using Windows 10.

How should investors look to capitalize on this growing trend? Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Mar 27, 2017 at 1:41PM Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days and has been dominating the headlines, while every tech company worth its salt is getting into the game. With all the hype, investors may be asking themselves: What's the best way to invest in this growing trend? Let's look at three companies with solid artificial-intelligence programs: e-commerce titan Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google search parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and cognitive-computing leader International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). Amazon's Echo smart-home speaker, powered by AI-based Alexa. Image source: Amazon, Inc. Amazon.com Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes that AI could be the fourth pillar of the company's business, behind its e-commerce, its cloud hosting unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Prime membership program. Alexa, the company's virtual assistant and AI poster child, hosts a variety of products that leverage her AI foundation, including the Echo smart-home speaker, the smaller Dot, and the portable Tap, as well as the Fire tablet and Fire TV Stick. Using natural-language processing and cloud computing, these products respond to voice commands, and AI allows Alexa to learn continuously the more the products are used. Developers have created more than 10,000 "skills" that provide a variety of functionality, from ordering pizza to scheduling a ride-share. Amazon has also been leveraging its deep-learning innovations by deploying them across AWS as managed services available to its customers. Lex, similar to Alexa, can build sophisticated chatbots; Rekognition provides image-recognition capabilities; and Polly reads and recites text. Amazon grew its revenue to $46 billion in its most recent quarter, so its AI contribution is currently microscopic, but that could change. RBC Capital Markets predicts that Alexa could contribute an additional $10 billion annually by 2020. Google Home smart speaker system. Image source: Google. Google Google has been investing heavily for years in a sub-discipline of AI called deep learning, and the result of that research is an artificial neural network, christened the Google Brain. By combining massive amounts of data with complicated algorithms, the system recognizes patterns and learns in a way similar to the human brain. The company has infused the knowledge gained into a vast array of its businesses, using AI to improve the reliability of its ubiquitous search, decrease the energy consumption of its servers, and catalog images from its Street View mapping cars. Its AI-powered Google Assistant, the company's entry in the growing list of virtual personal assistants, is available in many of the company's branded devices and is the foundation for its Google Home smart speaker system. Google Assistant interacts with the company's Photos, Maps, Keep, Calendar, and other services, provides the ability to stream music and movies to Android mobile devices, and controls home-automation products. Google is also a well-known pioneer in the area of AI-based autonomous driving. With $26 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter, Alphabet will notice little effect from Home just yet; this is a new product, so we don't have data for how popular it is, but the potential market is huge. Activate.com estimates that smart speakers will be in 21 million homes by 2020. Watson employs advanced analytics to "see" medical images. Image source: IBM. IBM IBM's Watson might be best remembered for its winning stint on the popular TV game show Jeopardy!, but Watson hasn't been resting on its laurels. You won't see consumer-facing products coming from Big Blue, but the company has developed a wide variety of business partnerships using the abilities of its cognitive AI supercomputer. Watson's earliest foray was into the field of healthcare, where it has been tasked with cancer research, immunotherapy, diabetes management, and genomic sequencing. Most notably, Watson was recently able to correctly diagnose cancer patients, agreeing with oncologists in 99% of cases. The cognitive computer also successfully diagnosed a rare form of leukemia in a case that had baffled doctors -- all within 10 minutes after being fed the data. Watson has partnered in other fields, improving the accuracy of tax returns, providing cybersecurity, and improving regulatory compliance for financial institutions. Watson is a bet on AI-based cognitive computing, data analytics, and cloud computing, as the company moves away from its legacy hardware and IT services business. IBM has yet to disclose Watson's contribution, but "strategic imperatives," where Watson's revenue is reported, grew 13% in 2016 to account for 41% of total revenue. Foolish final thoughts These companies are at the forefront of the AI revolution, but AI innovations represent only a portion of their total business. Investors should avoid investing in any of these companies based solely on the advantages represented by AI. That said, if you like any of these companies and are interested in adding AI to your portfolio, each offers that opportunity. While it may be difficult to quantify many of the benefits, we do know that AI can help increase revenue and efficiency, provide a compelling and productive ecosystem to consumers, and provide new opportunities for business.

/PRNewswire/ -- US advertisers could lose more than $9bn to ad fraud in 2017, according to new figures from The&Partnership and Adloox  'Ad Fraud America' study lays out steps industry must take to reverse growth of ad fraud  Almost a quarter of the money US brands spent on digital video and display advertising in 2016 may have been wasted on fraudulent placements, according to a new study from The&Partnership and Adloox. Fact Sheet: http://multivu.prnewswire.com/prnehost/PIV855086AdFraudUS.pdf The study, 'Ad Fraud America: The Real Scale of the Problem and How to Fix It', is part of a global report which has contributed to an exodus of advertisers from Google and YouTube over the past week - with brands including AT&T, Verizon, the UK government and the Guardian withdrawing spend from the platform amidst fears surrounding brand safety and fraudulent placements. The&Partnership's study reveals that the scale and cost of advertising fraud may until now have been significantly under-reported. Of the $32.17bn[1] spent on digital video and display advertising in the US alone in 2016, it estimated, a full $7.52bn (23%) may have been wasted on fraudulent advertising - approximately the same figure that the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) two years ago predicted would be lost globally to ad fraud in 2016.[2] In 2017, if US digital video and display spend grows to $37bn as forecast[3], the money US brands stand to lose could rise to $9bn. According to The&Partnership, this vast proportion of wasted spend could be reduced to single figures using specialist, third-party ad verification software - a critical element in the protection of brands which, until now, "walled gardened" platforms such as Google and YouTube have refused to allow - instead offering advertisers their own proprietary brand safety tools. Johnny Hornby, Founder of The&Partnership, said: "Having highlighted the problem, it's important to also highlight the solution. The proper use of ad verification software can reduce the 23% of advertising spend that may be being wasted on fraudulent - often reputation-threatening - advertising placements in the US down to 1 or 2%, if not better. "The issue, however, is that the big-platform players - and most critically YouTube, as part of the Google family - are still refusing to allow access of our ad-verification software to their platforms. Meanwhile, other platforms such as Facebook are also failing to allow us full access to their walled gardens - giving advertisers the visibility and transparency they deserve. "Without this, not only are these platforms denying our clients the clean, brand-safe environments they quite rightly demand - but advertisers also lack full transparency and visibility in terms of the money they are losing to fraudulent advertising and advertising that never gets seen. "If Google wants to see advertisers returning to YouTube in significant numbers," said Hornby, "it is going to have to move quickly on the following two things: "Firstly, Google needs to stop marking its own homework (as Keith Weed, Unilever Global CMO, recently observed) - fully opening up its walled gardens to independent, specialist ad verification software, to give brands the visibility and transparency they deserve. "Secondly, Google will need to start looking at brand safety from completely the other end of the telescope. Instead of allowing huge volumes of content to become ad-enabled every minute, and then endeavouring to convince advertisers that the dangerous and offensive content among it will be found and weeded out, it should be presenting advertisers only with advertising opportunities that have already been pre-vetted and found to be 100% safe. "Only then will we see the advertiser exodus from Google reversed - and brands begin to trust and invest in YouTube once again." The&Partnership and Adloox's report was conducted across a robust 200bn daily bid requests, 4bn ad calls and 10bn ad impressions a month, for a period of 12 months.

Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Updated: March 28, 2017 2:13 pm Custom designed compute and storage allow for real- time processing of data; fully integrated cooling solution keeps components running optimally. From Google to Uber to Nissan, dozens of companies are working on the concept of self-driving cars with varying degrees of autonomy. All have different end goals — from reducing the number of cars on the road to making cars more efficient and safe. However, as Friday’s crash involving an Uber driverless car in Arizona — in which the other car was at fault, but which still led to Uber suspending the testing of its driverless cars — has shown, the ride is likely to be bumpy. To begin with, what are self-driving cars? Self-driving — or driverless or robotic — cars use artificial intelligence and computing power to navigate from point A to point B, sensing their environment and making decisions in real time to avert mishaps. They do this using a range of sensors and cameras on all sides, as well as predetermined digital maps and real time inputs about traffic and obstacles. The first experimental self-driving cars started in 1984, but commercial trials are just a few years old. Mercedes Benz, one of the first players in the space, showcased its concept car, the F015, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 2015. The US is the hotbed of this technology, with at least 27 companies — including Tesla, Google and Volkswagen — seeking permissions for tests in California alone. In August 2016, Uber acquired the self-driving technology company Otto, and in October used an Otto self-driving truck to deliver a consignment of Budweiser beer in Colorado. Read | In San Francisco, one step towards car-free living But why do we need driverless cars? In theory, it is great economics. The 120 crore cars in the world sit idle for almost 95% of the time, making them perhaps the most inefficient human creation ever. Uber thinks that if all cars were autonomous and shared to scale, we could eliminate 90% of these vehicles. For residents of cities from Los Angeles to New Delhi, traumatised by traffic jams, this is an attractive idea. Fewer cars also mean reduced need for parking spaces — the US alone as over 2 billion — and a drastic reduction in pollution. Plus, it is possible that self-driving cars would eliminate the human errors that kill thousands on the roads every year.   Are there any special laws for these cars? They are still being ironed out. Recently, California became one of the first US states to draft a set of broad rules for the “autonomous test vehicles” on its roads. Among other requirements, the company running a test vehicle must put a driver behind the wheel as a fail safe, and make it known to everyone on the road that the vehicle is an autonomous one, and whether it is running in remote mode at a given point in time. What are manufacturers of driverless cars trying to achieve? Different things. Uber’s vision is to take reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere and everything. Nissan wants self-driving capabilities to make life easier for the driver, but not, unlike Uber, to replace her. Mercedes-Benz wants to help consumers put their time to better use, turning the commute into an opportunity to share lounge space. Since passengers won’t need to keep an eye on the road, they can use the travel time to relax or work. Inside the Mercedes-Benz F015 So what’s in the way of realising these? Google’s self-driving car has been caught in multiple collisions, and the crash in Arizona involving an Uber SUV last week was, even though no one was hurt, pretty serious. The technology is clearly nascent, and subject to other factors such as errors made by humans in other cars. There is bitter competition — Otto, Uber’s startup acquisition, is being sued by Google’s Waymo self-driving car unit, which claims it stole the company’s proprietary design for its laser-based radar system. Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski is a former Waymo employee. EVERYONE TO ANYTHING UBER sees its acquisition of Otto as a way to extend its vision of transporting “everyone, everywhere” to moving around “anything”. According to Matt Sweeney, who heads product at Uber’s Advanced Technology Group, “the truck and passenger vehicles share software and hardware components, and this helps us work on different aspects of the self-driving problem at the same time”. But while passenger vehicles are for urban environments where Uber focuses on ridesharing, the trucks will run on high-speed highways where the constraints are different. OTTO trucks are powered by a rig of radars, laser scanners and stereo cameras that give the computers inside a live 360-degree vision of the vehicle’s environment with high dynamic range, high resolution and high colour information imagery. As a result, the computing task is “almost as big as a small data centre”. Sweeney says while the truck has as many cellphone radios as possible, the bandwidth limitations are still very real, as gigabytes of data come in every minute, and “a lot of the computing has to be done in the vehicle itself”. INDIA, with its chaotic driving environment, presents a slew of challenges, accepts Sweeney. “Those are situations we think we will be able to tackle, but those are not the first places we will go,” he said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 March 2017 by Military News Ad Fraud America: The Real Scale of the Problem and How To Fix It NEW YORK, March 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- US advertisers could lose more than $9bn to ad fraud in 2017, according to new figures from The&Partnership and Adloox  'Ad Fraud America' study lays out steps industry must take to reverse growth of ad fraud  Almost a quarter of the money US brands spent on digital video and display advertising in 2016 may have been wasted on fraudulent placements, according to a new study from The&Partnership and Adloox. Fact Sheet: http://multivu.prnewswire.com/prnehost/PIV855086AdFraudUS.pdf The study, 'Ad Fraud America: The Real Scale of the Problem and How to Fix It', is part of a global report which has contributed to an exodus of advertisers from Google and YouTube over the past week - with brands including AT&T, Verizon, the UK government and the Guardian withdrawing spend from the platform amidst fears surrounding brand safety and fraudulent placements. The&Partnership's study reveals that the scale and cost of advertising fraud may until now have been significantly under-reported. Of the $32.17bn[1] spent on digital video and display advertising in the US alone in 2016, it estimated, a full $7.52bn (23%) may have been wasted on fraudulent advertising - approximately the same figure that the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) two years ago predicted would be lost globally to ad fraud in 2016.[2] In 2017, if US digital video and display spend grows to $37bn as forecast[3], the money US brands stand to lose could rise to $9bn. According to The&Partnership, this vast proportion of wasted spend could be reduced to single figures using specialist, third-party ad verification software - a critical element in the protection of brands which, until now, "walled gardened" platforms such as Google and YouTube have refused to allow - instead offering advertisers their own proprietary brand safety tools. Johnny Hornby, Founder of The&Partnership, said: "Having highlighted the problem, it's important to also highlight the solution. The proper use of ad verification software can reduce the 23% of advertising spend that may be being wasted on fraudulent - often reputation-threatening - advertising placements in the US down to 1 or 2%, if not better. "The issue, however, is that the big-platform players - and most critically YouTube, as part of the Google family - are still refusing to allow access of our ad-verification software to their platforms. Meanwhile, other platforms such as Facebook are also failing to allow us full access to their walled gardens - giving advertisers the visibility and transparency they deserve. "Without this, not only are these platforms denying our clients the clean, brand-safe environments they quite rightly demand - but advertisers also lack full transparency and visibility in terms of the money they are losing to fraudulent advertising and advertising that never gets seen. "If Google wants to see advertisers returning to YouTube in significant numbers," said Hornby, "it is going to have to move quickly on the following two things: "Firstly, Google needs to stop marking its own homework (as Keith Weed, Unilever Global CMO, recently observed) - fully opening up its walled gardens to independent, specialist ad verification software, to give brands the visibility and transparency they deserve. "Secondly, Google will need to start looking at brand safety from completely the other end of the telescope. Instead of allowing huge volumes of content to become ad-enabled every minute, and then endeavouring to convince advertisers that the dangerous and offensive content among it will be found and weeded out, it should be presenting advertisers only with advertising opportunities that have already been pre-vetted and found to be 100% safe. "Only then will we see the advertiser exodus from Google reversed - and brands begin to trust and invest in YouTube once again." The&Partnership and Adloox's report was conducted across a robust 200bn daily bid requests, 4bn ad calls and 10bn ad impressions a month, for a period of 12 months.

While that feature was first rolling out in Brazil, Google’s Amit Fulay now says that the feature is rolling out worldwide… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services “Google Duo Audio calls is rolling out worldwide now,” Amit Fulay said on Twitter. We’ve installed Google Duo 9 on our devices, but aren’t yet seeing the ability to make audio-only calls. But as is often the case with new features like these, it’s likely going to be a staged rollout over the course of several days. Even with Duo 9 installed, you might not see the feature for a while. But that said, we did find that Duo 9 includes some new strings alluding to the new audio-only calls, including strings for introducing users to the feature and making it obvious that it’s there: You can grab the Duo 9 APK over at APKMirror, or if you don’t want to go to that trouble, you can always just wait until the update hits your device via the Play Store.

Last week Samsung introduced Bixby, which is their new AI service. It is similar to Apple Siri, Google Now and Microsoft Cortana. It is on the new Galaxy S8. Samsung is coming late to the AI party, but since we are still very early in this new wave, being late won’t hurt them. The big question is, how usable and accurate will Bixby be? Current levels of AI like Siri, Now and Cortana have delighted the child in us, but are so far very unimpressive and inaccurate. Sure, when they were launched, it was exciting, but after a few years and after many improvements, they still get more wrong than right. The excitement is gone. Today we expect more from AI. Will Samsung Bixby be a hit or a flop? This is the world Bixby is entering. Are they ready? I have not yet used Bixby, but let me share my expectations. While I expect Bixby to be a welcomed addition to the world of AI, I don’t expect it to be very useful in these early stages. Every Bixby competitor is wrong more than it’s right. However, AI is the future, so it will get better as the months and years go by. Samsung is coming at this from a different angle. Apple Siri, Google Now and Microsoft Cortana were introduced as a new service from companies on their growth path. Amazon Alexa and Google Home have also entered this space and are even better. IBM Watson is even better. However, all these companies were in their growth mode, and their AI offerings only added to their position in the mind. Direct AI competitors Like Apple Siri, Google Now, Microsoft Cortana If Samsung introduced Bixby a year ago, before the fire storm, they would have had a stronger chance of success. They would have been in the same position as their competitors. However, they didn’t. And a few short months ago Samsung dealt with a blow that would have put a smaller company out of business. So, this is a shaky time in the history of Samsung. Now they are introducing Bixby after that fiasco. They could indeed be successful if it’s a great technology. But the stakes are higher than ever. If Bixby is good–I mean really good–it could take the eye of customers and investors off of yesterday’s disaster and focus on the future. That’s the big if. Other AI competitors Like Amazon Alexa, Google Home and IBM Watson Remember, wireless and smartphones are a very strong, growth industry. They always have been and they always will be. But as an industry, that is changing, as it always has changed. Going forward, growth will come from new areas and AI will play in increasingly important role. So now we wait. We wait to see if Samsung Bixby is a hit. We wait to see if they can wave their magic wand and make the horrific and disastrous yesterday disappear and be replaced by a fast growing and captivating new growth story. We wait to see if Samsung can indeed step back into the plus side of the equation. So, Samsung, you are up at bat. Hope you hit a home run. You need it.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com More Big Brands Pull Ads from YouTube in Widening Boycott By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MARCH 27 2017 An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube -- an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: iStock.

Facebook Adds More Snapchat-Like Features By Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: MARCH 28 2017 Facebook is adding more Snapchat-like features to its app. The company says it wants to let your camera "do the talking" as more people are posting photos and videos instead of blocks of text. Facebook is rolling out an app update starting Tuesday. With it, you can tap a new camera icon on the top left corner. That opens up the phone's camera to do a photo or video post. You could have posted photos from the app before, but it took an extra tap. Once you open the camera, you'll find Facebook's other new Snapchat-like features, including filters that can be added to images. Other effects, such as animations and other interactive filters, are a new twist to dressed-up photos. Also new is a "stories" tool that lets you post photos and videos that stay live for 24 hours. This feature is already available on Messenger and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Snapchat pioneered camera-first sharing and is wildly popular with younger users. Years ago, Facebook tried to buy the company but was rebuffed. Since then, it has been trying, with varying degrees of success, to clone Snapchat's most popular features. It might be working: Snapchat's growth rate has slowed down since Instagram introduced its own "stories" feature. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Uber Halts Self-Driving Cars After Arizona Crash PUBLISHED: MARCH 27 2017 Uber suspended its pilot program testing self-driving cars after one of the vehicles was involved in an accident in Arizona, the company said Saturday. The accident happened when a self-driving Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle was struck by another vehicle that failed to yield when making a left turn. The SUV overturned and struck a third vehicle. No serious injuries were reported, police said. The Uber vehicle was not at fault for the accident, officers said. The ride-sharing company has been testing self-driving cars in Tempe, Ariz., Pittsburgh and California for months as it undertakes one of the most ambitious autonomous vehicle projects in the country. Uber was forced to halt its California pilot project when the city of San Francisco and the state revoked vehicle registrations after a permitting dispute. The company has since applied for the state autonomous vehicle permit and has put two such cars back on the road there. While technically self-driving, all of Uber's pilot vehicles have a driver behind the wheel who can take over control of the vehicle at any time. In Saturday's crash, the driver was the only individual inside and the SUV was operating in autonomous mode. The company released a statement on the incident, saying they are "looking into" what happened. They did not offer a timetable for when the self-driving vehicles would return to the road. © 2017 UPI Top Stories under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Google Offers Android O Preview Next Article > Samsung Needs Galaxy S8 Phone To Impress, Mend Its Reputation PUBLISHED: MARCH 28 2017 The Galaxy S8 will feature Samsung's Bixby virtual personal assistant. Samsung will on Wednesday [March 29] hold an event in New York, which will be live-streamed around the world, to launch its flagship Galaxy S8. The South Korean electronics company needs to repair its brand perception as a viable smartphone manufacturer after its flagship phablet device, the Galaxy Note 7 [pictured above], had to be recalled last year and eventually cancelled after a fault in battery design led to the smartphones catching fire. The launch of the S8 was pushed out by a few months. Samsung's new handsets are normally launched in February every year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. This year, the company apparently wanted to fully resolve the battery issues that led to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Information officially released by the firm, and a series of leaks from Korean-based tech blogs, have given customers a glimpse into what to expect this week. Bixby, which will be included in the S8. Bixby is the firm's Siri and Google Assistant equivalent. The virtual personal assistant (VPA) will supposedly be more conversational than Apple's Siri and ask follow-up questions if it did not understand the request. Samsung says Bixby will let users control compatible apps via voice only. In Apple's latest update, Siri can interact with other apps, like order an Uber, but users still have to physically touch the phone at some part in the process to complete the order. Adverts for the Galaxy S8 launch have been taking up prime-time slots on television for the past few weeks. The ads feature a black screen with two white lines that outline the top and bottom of the device. This suggests the S8 will have a small bezel -- the space between the screen and edge of the device -- and no home button. This is in line with previously reported leaks. The company also released an advert in January to show off its new super AMOLED display in South Korea. The video features an unreleased device with small bezels which is suspected to be the S8. The rumors Various leaks suggest there will be two versions of the S8 unveiled this week: one with the standard 5.7-inch display and the second with a larger 6.2-inch screen. The curved 'Edge' display that previously appeared on the S6 and S7 is said to have been done away with. Both S8 smartphones will have flat screens. As there will be no home screen button at the bottom of the screen, it is rumoured the fingerprint sensor will be embedded into the screen or at the back of the device. The S8 is expected to be one of the first phones to market with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor. Both the S8 smartphone models will allegedly keep the 3.5mm headphone jack, which Apple controversially decided not to include in its iPhone 7 range last year. An updated version of the virtual reality headset, the Gear VR, and the Samsung 360 camera are also expected to be announced this week. © 2017 ITWeb under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Android Nougat’s successor, Android O, has made its first foray into the public eye with the launch of its initial developer preview, and while there aren’t too many show-stopping new features, the new operating system brings with it a variety of interesting additions. Here are some of the most interesting changes that Android O brings to the table: Notification Channels enable more user control Depending on how apps implement Android O’s new Notification Channels feature, the endless tide of notifications that crashes down on most of us could soon become a little more relenting. The idea behind notification channels is to give users more control over what they receive. Previously, Android users could block notifications from an app, but they had to block all notifications. Notification Channels breaks them into segments so that users can select, on a more granular level, what they want to hear about. For instance, users might be able to turn off notifications for Facebook likes but keep them on for tags and @ mentions. Additionally, a chat app might break each conversation out into a separate channel, giving the user the ability to mute some conversations but not all. While it’s a great idea, the most important question is how well apps will take advantage of Notifications Channels to provide a better user experience. Here’s hoping social media and messaging apps lead the way with a broad range of specific channel options. Picture-in-picture video takes mobile multi-tasking to the next level With Android O, Google is expanding its picture-in-picture (PiP) feature from Android TV to phones and tablets. Like Notification Channels, picture-in-picture depends on developer uptake, but it generally means that users will be able to take video content from one app with them while they browse another app. The video will shrink into a floating box that overlays itself on whatever app the user is currently operating. Google specifies that apps can put themselves into PiP mode from a paused or resumed state and that developers can specify aspect ratios and custom interactions for video controls while the video is in PiP. Users can expect to see the strongest early example of PiP on the mobile Android operating system through Google’s own YouTube. Settings has a simplified new look Google has redesigned its settings app yet again with Android O, this time with a strong focus on simplicity. There is no longer any slide-out menu and the categories on the main page of the Settings app are extremely high level. There are 13 main headings (with short descriptions of what’s inside) and nothing else — apart from the search tool in the top right corner and some suggestions that appear before the headings, which can be dismissed. Further within the Settings app, some of the categories have also received design refreshes, including Battery, shown above. Official autofill API makes filling out forms on mobile less annoying Filling out forms and performing other typing-heaving activities has traditionally been much less enjoyable on Android than desktop, due to the lack of mobile autofill. Google’s aiming to change that with Android O, however, by providing apps with the ability to register as a system-wide provider of autofill services. This means that autofill services will operate much like keyboard apps, which become an integral part of the phone’s essential functions. Google, for instance, will no doubt bring its own autofill expertise to the task and offer an autofill service. Once chosen, users can navigate to and make changes to their autofill app by heading to settings > ‘Apps & notifications’ > ‘Default apps’ > ‘Autofill app.’ UI Tuner adds ability to set custom lockscreen shortcuts and nav buttons The System UI Tuner, introduced with Android Marshmallow to provide users with more customization options, has been improved with Android O to offer control over the navigation bar and lockscreen shortcuts. This means that users can now new navigation buttons (though it’s a multi-step process that currently requires special key codes) and choose left and right apps that can be launched from the lockscreen. Related Google Maps users will soon be able to share their exact location with family and friends Google Inc announces first Canadian ‘cloud region’ in Montreal, allows sensitive data to stay within borders To get customizing, users first need to turn on the UI Tuner by long pressing on the Settings cog in the quick settings shade. Once that’s turned on, users can then head to System in the settings app and navigate to the System UI Tuner section, where you’ll see sections for the lock screen and navigation bar. The lock screen apps are simply changed with a few taps in that section, but the navigation bar is a little trickier. You’ll need to select the icon and then, separately, select the purpose using one of these keycodes. There are great many to choose from, including a launch button for the camera or even a quick Caps Lock key, if you’re a digital shouter. In any case, it’s a lot of fun — but Google warns that these features are experimental and may break or disappear in future releases. These are some of the most interesting elements of Android O, but far from all of them. For instance, there are the potential power savings that come with Android O and the fact that Google now directly supports building in screen notification badges — think the little notification alerts on home screen apps that are a hallmark of iOS and several Android skins.  MobileSyrup is a Canadian-focused tech site dedicated to providing the latest news & reviews on smartphones, tablets, wearables, IoT, VR, gaming and automotive.

Top 10 insights on local marketing at LSA17 Wesley Young shares expert insights about location marketing and local search from the Local Search Association's 2017 Annual Conference. Wesley Young on March 27, 2017 at 10:18 am More At the Local Search Association annual conference a few weeks ago, search and marketing experts in the local space provided insights into trends and challenges the advertising, marketing and search industry faces today. Here are 10 of the top takeaways shared at LSA17. 1. Location drives almost all consumer engagement, even for national brands According to Rob Blatt at Momentfeed, 85 to 95 percent of consumer engagement for brands happens through location assets such as local listings and local pages. That would explain why 50 percent of brands are using location data to target customers. A strong shift in marketing budgets toward location-based marketing is naturally following that trend. Data from the Location Based Marketing Association (LBMA) found that 25 percent of leading brands’ marketing budgets are spent on location-based marketing, and that number is projected to rise. Companies in the US increased use of location-based marketing by 5 percent from 2016 to 2017, while those in Canada increased use 6 percent and those in the UK 7 percent. In terms of dollars, Neg Norton, president of LSA, shared that in 2016, $12.4 billion was spent on location-targeted ad spending, rising to $32.4 billion by 2021, equivalent to 45 percent of all mobile ad revenue. With local often being synonymous with location in the marketplace, these numbers emphasize that local marketing and local presence are just as important as national campaigns. Last month, I observed factors that influence the appearance in search results on Google Maps, and notably, national brand reputation was not a ranking factor. As consumers increasingly look locally for information, all businesses — whether traditional SMBs, franchises or local stores belonging to national brands — must recognize how location needs to be a core part of their marketing strategy. 2. Location is much more than targeting a place Long gone are the days when location was solely used to target based on proximity. Location data has grown much more abundant and rich in its insight to consumer preferences and profiles. Shashi Seth of xAd shared how the increasing volume of location data can be used to build consumer profiles that allow for better and more productive targeting. Four out of five mobile phone users have smartphones. These always-on devices are being checked, on average, 46 times a day and provide constant location data through sensor technology such as GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi, apps, compass, accelerometer and gyroscope functions built into the devices. Likewise, the number of sensors, such as beacons, being deployed to detect those devices is exploding. In Q2 of 2015, there were approximately 900,000 such sensors worldwide, growing to over 13 million by the end of 2016 — growth of almost 13.5 times during that time span, according to data shared by Marianna Zaslavsky at Unacast. And that number is expected to grow to 500 million by 2021. The volume and frequency of location data being transmitted may be aggregated to determine broader trends. Oren Naim with Google shared new functions on Google Maps that provide live data on its crowd indicator for locations such as restaurants. That data can be further analyzed to profile the audience at a specific location. But Seth explained that, broken down by individual, location data maps a consumer journey that reveals information such as what you like to eat and where you shop, whether you work out and what you do for entertainment. It provides frequency and time of day for various activities. Demographic information such as income, gender and age can be extrapolated by where you live, shop and work. Source: xAd presentation at LSA17 This incredibly rich data may be used to effectively target users with relevant content, leading to better returns. LSA will continue to explore location and how to use it in local marketing at its Place Conference later this year. 3. How do you scale local? While consumers demand local information, brands like Walgreens with thousands of locations are challenged to manage local information across the country. Walgreens, Brandify and Brandmuscle covered those challenges, including the following: The tension between brand consistency and personalization Managing accurate content and messaging Fragmented control over local managers Development of an efficient process to maintain local content Non-brand-controlled platforms such as Google knowledge graphs Executing locally is still evolving and remains a company-by-company decision. By definition, it is hard to template local success, and that might seem to favor giving local managers greater power in making decisions over local marketing and content. Many brands haven’t reached that point of trust or training yet or have operations that demand more operational consistency. Given the right support, either a top-down or bottom-up strategy can be successful. Walgreens uses an approval process for adding content that has helped scale local content more seamlessly. Regardless, this will be an area of continual development, driven by the value of local and the influence of consumers who want to know if they can bring their dog into a store or if it is closed because of weather. The challenges with scale may also be an opportunity for smaller agencies and marketing providers. Niche practices by geography or vertical allow focus where their strengths lie and where others who rely on scale may not be capable of or willing to work. 4. Attribution is getting better — and becoming necessary Another area in which location data is making a difference is attribution. Accurate attribution has long been sought by both clients and marketers to justify work done and demonstrate ROI. Allyson Carper at Brandify stated that online-to-offline attribution is the industry’s path to success. Improved location data available today makes it much easier to track store visits. While attribution is typically still a comparison of usual traffic to post-exposure traffic at a location after a specific campaign, the volume of data makes such comparisons much more accurate and meaningful. More detailed data, such as profile-building described in the consumer journey above, also allows a deeper analysis of who is the most responsive audience. For example, in a campaign for a quick service restaurant, it was presumed that consumers who frequented fast food restaurants were the best target audience. Ninth Decimal’s attribution analysis helped reveal that consumers who were DIY enthusiasts, movie enthusiasts and leisure travelers were better targets. Such insight allows future campaigns to be refined and better targeted. 5. Privacy laws: the threat to local marketing While there was no planned discussion at LSA17 on the impact privacy laws may have on location-based marketing, the issue was raised — and rightly so. All the benefits and increased ROI of using location data could come crashing down if overly restrictive regulation on the collection, distribution and use of location data is passed. The problem is two-fold. First, location data is being categorized in proposed legislation as personally identifiable information subject to protections provided to data, such as health or financial information. Commonly, opt-in permission and disclosure requirements are imposed as part of the regulation, with significant penalties for non-compliance. Such regulation may impose restrictions that create serious barriers to use of that data. Second, states are looking at individual and different approaches to regulation, making compliance very difficult, since the future potentially holds numerous different and conflicting regulations across physical state borders that online content often does not adhere to. There are also some broader concerns with the use of targeting data including location. The FTC released a paper last year exploring how big data might be used in a discriminatory manner. For example, if location data were to be used in a manner that treated users from a predominantly African-American neighborhood differently, those users may be impacted in a discriminatory fashion. These are issues that the industry must tackle in a unified and intentional manner or risk losing significant innovations made possible only with the use of rich and voluminous data. 6. The threat to traditional branding Brands have traditionally relied on consistency and control of brand assets to maintain the image and reputation they want in the public sphere. But that control is being hijacked by social media and other consumer-generated content. Reputation can crumble to the ground with one viral tweet. Consider the over 200,000 users that left Uber after the #DeleteUber movement. Brands such as Chick-fil-A recognized this shift toward a public definition of reputation and expressed having to adapt to managing social media in trying to maintain its brand identity. On the other hand, traditional SMBs are well aware of how reviews can impact their businesses. And consumers are increasingly enabled by Google to generate photos and business information such as hours of operation and to record other observed commentary in local business knowledge graph pages. The ready access to shopping information is also making consumers less brand loyal. According to Google, 65 percent of smartphone users look for the most relevant information, regardless of company or provider. A recent study by McKinsey also found that only three business categories out of 30 were loyalty-driven. Those three were mobile carriers, auto insurance and investments. That’s not to say that branding isn’t important. Keeping your business top-of-mind pays off, as consumers are more likely to buy from companies considered first. But consumers are much more likely to look around every time they shop and hear many more opinions that influence their decisions. Managing online reputation will continue to challenge local businesses. 7. Companies must continually innovate, and build a process to do so One constant in the marketing industry is change. LSA17 was a microcosm of such change: 75 percent of companies at the conference were not there three years ago. Everyone agreed that innovation is necessary to keep up with such change. Big brands such as Blue Cross Blue Shield have had to innovate to adjust to changing healthcare laws, and agencies such as Propel Marketing seek out employees who think outside the box to grow the company. Steve Nedvidek, Chick-fil-A’s innovation specialist, shared three stages of innovation that the household brand has gone through, providing lessons for any size business. Stage 1 is during the early stages of a business, when lots of innovation is needed to establish the business identity — for example, introducing the boneless fried filet in the Chick-fil-A sandwich, inventing franchising and being the first to open locations in malls. Stage 2 is during the growing stages of a business, when execution is more important and innovation is periodic — Chick-fil-A came up with the self-preservationist cow spokesperson and slogan “Eat Mor Chikin” during this stage. Stage 3 is where it is today, encouraging systemic innovation in a maturing enterprise where they face challenges such as how to squeeze $5 million in sales from kitchens designed for $2 million. Critical to innovating is having a process to do so. Chick-fil-A created a physical space called “Hatch” where innovation takes place. Advice Local holds monthly brainstorming meetings to come up with ideas, big or small. Propel Marketing emphasizes the need to test and analyze ideas, while Kris Barton from ReachLocal expressed that he spends a lot of time shutting down ideas that don’t fit the capability or credibility of the company. Nevertheless, it is important to not criticize failure that is not a result of execution. And fortunately, failure is much less expensive today, according to Steve Aldrich of GoDaddy. Technology has significantly lowered the barriers to starting a business or experimenting with an idea. So embrace risk and reward innovation. 8. Marketers need to take their own advice Sharon Rowlands of ReachLocal observed that not enough marketers are practicing what we preach. It is important to increase the productivity of sales by targeting prospects better, the same way providers help clients target their customers. Jon Martinsen of FCR Media further explained the importance of using data to segment prospects to help focus the sales consultation. Second, recognize the importance of repeat customers. According to Google, the probability of selling to existing customers is 60 to 70 percent, compared to only 5 to 20 percent for new customers. Making sure to invest in customer support is one of the most important things that led to ReachLocal’s recent success. 9. Artificial Intelligence won’t take over marketing… yet Brendan King of Vendasta noted Amara’s Law applies to marketing: we often overestimate the effect of technology in the short term, but underestimate it in the long term. So it seems with artificial intelligence (AI). There’s been significant media coverage over the threat AI poses to both the function of marketing providers and their sales teams. Yet perhaps the inability to scale and the complexity of customized local services have helped preserve jobs in local marketing. King stated that 85 percent of all marketing services are still sold through local providers. Right now, the tools simply are not good enough. The luxury of failure might exist for innovation but not for clients. Andrea Kayal at Signpost and others from TIMIFY and Freshlime all posited that human decisions are still needed to execute quality marketing campaigns. AI can help streamline some services, but Eric Owen at Mono Solutions pointed out that automation is only as good as the data that is used to direct the work. Nevertheless, technology — and specifically artificial intelligence — is supposed to help solve complex problems, and in the long term, it’s foreseeable that it will solve the scalability and nuances of local marketing. 10. Mobile prodigies are the future Mobile prodigies are young people who have never lived in a world without mobile. Julie Bernard at Verve shared some statistics about these mobile prodigies whose consumer behavior will shape the future of local marketing. Almost half spend more time on their mobile devices than on TV. And time with mobile devices continues to grow, with 80 percent saying they spend more time on apps than they did one year ago, downloading on average five to six apps per month. An astounding 95 percent make in-store purchases influenced by mobile ads, and 56 percent even rely primarily on their mobile device while shopping at home. Yet mobile prodigies also have strong preferences for the content they consume; 80 percent expect tailored ads based on location, interests, hobbies or habits. The rewards are strong for those who cater to these needs, as 60 percent will share sensitive data if ads are customized and relevant. Appealing content is nothing new, but it takes more resources to customize content. As data and tools make that a more reachable goal and as mobile prodigies grow in influence and buying power, the return will justify the investment into creative content.

Google Search Analytics bug drops some image search traffic from reports No need to panic: There is a reporting bug in the Google Search Console Search Analytics report. Google is working on a fix. Barry Schwartz on March 27, 2017 at 10:12 am More Google has posted a note that the Search Analytics report within the Google Search Console might be missing some image search data. This does not mean that you lost any traffic, but rather, the report might show a drop in traffic because of a data bug. Google said this impacts the Search Analytics report starting on March 24, 2017. Google wrote this only impacts image search, so you might be able to see the drop if you filter the report to show only image search traffic. Google wrote: Some data for clicks and impressions in image search is being dropped. This is a logging issue, not a traffic issue. We are investigating and hope to have a fix soon. Again, this is just a reporting bug and should not have resulted from a real traffic loss. Here is a screen shot showing the “note” in the chart on March 24: Google has no estimated time for when this will be resolved. A few weeks ago, you may have seen an image search traffic loss, but that was due to a design change in how Google image search works in specific countries.

Preparing for local reach in a ‘post-rank’ world: Get your data in line How might voice search impact local businesses? Columnist Megan Hannay shares her predictions and provides some advice on how SMBs can prepare for a future without rankings. Megan Hannay on March 27, 2017 at 11:50 am More Just last October at the Street Fight Summit, many marketers ranked voice search as the most “over-hyped” marketing tactic of the year. I think this is because many of them aren’t seeing the full scope of the technology. We’re putting on our consumer brains and thinking about the current awkwardness of speaking to Siri in public, not of a future inside self-driving cars or those moments when we just don’t want to get up from the couch. Currently, most voice searches happen on mobile phones. But within the next few years, it seems likely that devices with this capacity will increase in prevalence — and technological capability — in private spaces, where voicing out-loud intent won’t feel so silly. What might voice search mean for local? Most who do believe in a voice-dominated future are in a love/hate relationship with the idea. Some predict we’ll lose all local organic space to ads. Others foresee a future in which anything less than the No. 1 rank is worthless. I see both conclusions as an incomplete picture. A recent Moz study demonstrated that only 3.4 percent of Google local searches result in ad clicks. While it’s possible to anticipate a future in which voice search results are entirely paid ads, the fact that consumers seem to largely prefer organic suggests that Google would have a hard time retaining customers with such a model. Imagine if Google’s “I’m feeling lucky” search were a paid ad spot — who would click that button? Replacing the organic “best” option with the highest bidder changes our perception of the result. For businesses, this is further encouragement to tap into the power of organic local reach via accurate data and local knowledge sharing. Additionally, I think it’s a fallacy to assume that instant answers will beget a world where only the lucky top-ranked result wins. Rather, as I’ll show in this post, voice will make filtering for exactly what a consumer wants a much simpler process. So instead of a single No. 1 rank for a given local keyword (e.g., “divorce lawyer Los Angeles”), there will be dozens of No. 1 pages based on the other parameters a searcher indicates in her query (“a female divorce lawyer within a 20-minute drive from my office in Los Angeles who has experience in custody cases and pre-nups, with at least a 4.5-star rating and who can meet during my lunch break this week”). So a “post-rank” world doesn’t mean “a world where there’s only top-dog answer” — it means “a world where there are many equally top-dog answers.” Below, I’ll go over some ways local and brick-and-mortar businesses should prepare for a voice-dominated future. In the next couple of posts, I’ll explain how this trend will affect national and online-based service providers. Many of the factors that will affect local reach are arguably more organic than SEO tactics. And most will still require the expertise of digital marketers. One note: These are predictions. The closest I’ve come to a crystal ball is a fortune teller in New Orleans who intuited that “sometimes I worry about things.” But many of these predictions have foundations from people in the search and marketing community with far more experience than I do, such as Cindy Krum, Mike Blumenthal and David Mihm. Local results in a voice search future In a “post-rank” world, much of the digital effort will be focused on ensuring that a business’s digital presence is an accurate reflection of the real world via detailed service descriptions, numerous reviews and prolific interactions. At least three factors will increasingly affect local results in a voice-first world: 1. Local reach will be affected by searcher proximity to local businesses Essentially, mobile searches that vary by even a mile or so can produce drastically different local rank results. See Darren Shaw’s research for more on this. Desktop-based searches can be less specific, since they depend on IP. For the most part, this factor cannot be influenced unless you move offices. If your location is farther out of town (and farther from the local population than your competitors), your business may not surface as often in voice results for searchers in the center of town. 2. Local reach will be affected by how ‘good’ the business is David Mihm pointed out in a recent post that as Google’s capacity to measure real-world engagement with businesses increases, positive engagement signals will mostly likely improve local rank. Many of these signals will be directly affected by the quality of the business’s services, such as: How many locals frequent the business? How many people return after a first visit? How many positive sentiment social media mentions does the business have? (Remember, Google has access to the Twitter fire hose now.) Hopefully, most local business or franchise owners already care about the quality of their products and services. But soon, this quality — or lack thereof — may directly affect their digital presence. If search engines can only offer one answer, they want to send customers to an experience they’ll be satisfied with. 3. Local reach will be affected by how well the local business’s digital presence serves searchers’ needs So I need to find a local, well-reviewed appliance repair specialist to come to my home between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. tonight. They also need to have experience with Samsung refrigerators. The screen shot below shows my current (March 2017) mobile result for “fridge repair.” Google already has much of the information needed for my specific request, save the Samsung specification. Looks like today I’m going with Sears Appliance, as they’re the only top-ranked business open at a time that works for this particular request. But I’ve actually had a repair person come to my home who didn’t specialize in my appliance model, wasting my time and his, so I’ll need to call first to ensure that Sears can repair my specific fridge. I anticipate that in a couple of years, Google Assistant will be able to perform this task for me, based on a query like, “Ok Google, I need a fridge repair specialist, rated four stars or higher, for tonight at 7 p.m., and make sure they can work with Samsung products.” And that’s it — Google will take care of the rest; after telling me the name of the business and confirming that I’m OK with a 4.2-star-rated service, the entire process will still take less than a minute. I anticipate that apps integrating service businesses’s team schedules with Google searches will soon become a staple of local search, completing the last piece of this cycle. The pieces for this transaction are almost together on the infrastructure side for Google, but further research on my end shows a plethora of local businesses on Yelp and Facebook that haven’t yet taken the time to build out a clear Google My Business listing or their own website. This includes one local business with excellent reviews that’s been in the area for 20 years and provides services 24/7. Yes, finally. Here’s the voice-search factor marketers can invest in. Optimizing for voice search via detailed content Local businesses need to prepare for voice search by ensuring “long-tail” details are clearly displayed on the web. Remember my Samsung model problem? We’ll soon live in a world in which a consumer won’t want to spend 10 minutes calling around with a question like that; she’ll expect to find it, well, instantly. Maybe some weekend, I’ll want to find a local restaurant within walking distance of my home that’s good for a date night, features vegan options and live music and has a booth available at 7:30 p.m. that night. The more details search engines can parse through, the more long-tail local searches a given business will be able to service. Even if Google doesn’t yet have markup options for such specific details, local websites featuring structured data will have an advantage in a voice-search world. More details — even those that don’t yet have markup options — can only enhance a website. Mobile search expert Cindy Krum recently explained why it makes sense to anticipate more integration between search engines and local listings: Google will push more and more assets into their cloud, because it allows them decrease their reliance on crawling, and increase their understanding [of] how users engage with the content over time. I don’t see many small business owners with the technical know-how to apply structured data to their websites, so it’s almost certain that these responsibilities will fall to local marketing agencies. Then again, building a good-looking website is much easier than it was 10 or 15 years ago, thanks to providers like Squarespace and Wix. I don’t see why Google (and/or some savvy startups) wouldn’t work to simplify the data-add process for local business owners in the coming years. Optimizing for voice search via reviews Local businesses need to prepare for voice search by curating customer reviews. I’m excited to see how the future of voice affects reviews, and I anticipate it’ll change the experience for both reviewers and review readers. Google already initiates questions on more objective business characteristics. We already have pop-ups after leaving local businesses, inviting us to quickly rate our experience. It’s an easy jump to anticipate voice searches in which customers request a local experience with “good reviews” or “four star or higher reviews.” The extra selective may request “four point five star or higher” experiences. If we’re going to make a quick choice, we want to know that it’s a good choice. I’d be much more willing to make an appointment with a 4.3-star hair stylist whose website I haven’t seen than a 2.7-star hair stylist. At the end of the day, reviews are a reflection of the entire business. No amount of marketing can fix a poor customer experience, but marketers can ensure that customers who do report positive experiences are encouraged to leave reviews on public directories or search engines. Optimizing for voice search via local branding Local businesses need to prepare for voice search by establishing a local brand. This is the qualitative branch of local reach. As search engines’ abilities to understand real-world interactions improve, more attribution will be built between local brand and local prevalence. Businesses are already building this capability between digital ads and foot traffic. It’s not a long shot from here to measuring the number of event attendees at a business’s event booth, or the match between your business and its logo on a local Little League team t-shirt. Search will increasingly become a digital map of real-world relationships, whether it’s conveying the quality of a product, the details of a service or a brand’s prevalence in the community. Where next? I performed zero voice searches during my research for this article, as there’s not yet an instant answer for “how will voice search affect digital marketing?” Clearly, we’re still in the toddler years of this technology. But my research methods also highlight a stark difference between search types: quick answers and deep research. Both take space in local marketplaces, but each will respond to different types of queries. And, in my view, each will be serviced by a different business type. So in the next post, I’ll dive deeper into how content and community development may affect local reach, even in a post-rank world.

Read on to find out where they are, what options are available and how to use them. Emoji characters while typing have become increasingly more popular on Android and iOS. Android 6.0 Marshmallow added over 200, and Nougat has even more. Both Apple and Google continue to improve their offering, which is good for everyone. Read: How to Use Galaxy S7 & S7 Edge Emoji Below is a quick guide explaining where they are, and the easiest way to use Android emoji while typing. You won’t need a new keyboard either, they are built right into stock Android. Additionally, multiple 3rd party keyboard add even more. Many manufacturers like Samsung have additional emoji for its smartphones. Our guide above covers Samsung.  Then, third party text apps like Textra have add-ons that will deliver iOS characters for Android users. None of that is needed if you run Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow or newer. Which, almost everyone should be. With that out of the way, here’s how to find and use all of the Android emoji. Ars Technica has a nice list of all the new ones, and what’s changed. Instructions In order to take advantage of the new Android emoji images and characters that were added to our phones or tablets users will need to be running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Once they are, they’re built right into the stock Google Keyboard. If you have an older phone, other methods are required. Read: Android Nougat vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow Users can simply head into their text message application of choice, the messenger app on Nexus smartphones, or even Google hangouts and start typing. Same rules apply to an email. Users just need to hit the emoji “smiley face” on the keyboard, or long press for access. Swipe between them to find what you want, as there are a lot of them. While using Google Keyboard, depending on the application you are in the emoji icon will automatically appear in the bottom right. Alternatively it will be the secondary action under the “return” key. In Google Hangouts and many messenger apps, it’s there by default. Tap the bottom right corner smiley, and flip through all the emoji. From tacos, smiley faces, hand gestures, flipping the bird and hundreds more. As you can see above (left) the emoji face is present by default while writing on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Tapping will show everything in our screenshot to the right. Then, there are countless different columns (in black and white) to choose from. Scroll through and find what you’d like. Other Details With other apps, like Textra or text message applications, this may not be present. Instead, there is a return key like most keyboards for typing. Users just need to press and hold the return key, and the same smiley face as above will pop-up above it. From here just let go and the emoji keyboard appears full of the same options. Shown above is how Google keyboard looks in use. Long-pressing the return key pops up a smiley face and then grants users access to the over 200 new emoji characters. That app is now called GBoard, but the same options remain. It’s worth noting that the small three dots under the period or comma (on either side of the space bar) can also be long-pressed for additional options. No matter what you’re doing on an Android smartphone or tablet, as long as the keyboard is available, users can access and use any of the emoji characters that were added in Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Considering most users have been updated to Android 6.0 or 7.0, everyone should have these options. If you have any questions, drop us a comment below. 29 Responses 12/13/2015 Robertrsilvia Reply 0=07 my neighbor’s ex-wife makes $68 /hr on the laptop .

While a significant amount his wealth comes from stock he received as Google's CEO, the billionaire credits a few personal finance strategies with helping build his net worth. Here are the three tips Schmidt says any professional can use to make and save more money: Marlene Awaad | Bloomberg | Getty Images Eric Schmidt, chairman of Alphabet Inc 1. Take full advantage of your 401(k) "If your company offers matching 401(k), take it — all of it," the exec tells CNBC. "Maximize what you put into anything that's matched," he says. "That's a 50 or 100 percent return depending on your company's policy, instantly." This isn't the only piece of advice Schmidt has for professionals. In a recently-updated edition of "How Google Works," he says workers should have an elevator pitch memorized. It's not only useful for getting a new job, but can help you advance in your current role. In the book, Schmidt also encourages professionals to read constantly read about their industry. 2. Don't try to beat the market While it may be tempting to buy or sell stocks based on daily movements, short-term trading isn't going to make you rich, Schmidt says. "Don't try to beat the market," he says. "Don't try to pick stocks." Instead, think long-term. "Invest in index funds, Vanguard funds," he says, emphasizing different types of mutual funds tied to broad sectors of the stock market. This long-term strategy is the same one billionaire Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, swears by. 3. Think twice about hiring a money manager "Two words: 'Minimize fees,'" Schmidt says. "Do not pay someone a lot of money to manage your money for you." Schmidt says that paying someone to manager your money ends up costing you more over time. "Understand how much it costs you to pay someone one percent a year to manage your money," he says. Instead, he says, take that money you save on fees and invest it yourself.

But at the same time, these services are saving operators money when it comes to deploying that infrastructure. Lynn Smith, program manager at Vertex Innovations, listed three ways that OTT and cloud-based services are helping operators cut costs. 1. Google Earth As carriers deploy more fiber to leverage the digital capabilities of LTE, they often work with fiber vendors to find the place where the leased dark fiber should connect to the carrier’s fiber. This called the “meet point.” “One of our biggest challenges is the meet points with the fiber vendors,” Smith said. “Is it at the right of way, or is it at a point of demarcation in the building, or is it at the bottom of the tower?” Smith said that in the past, site walks and photographs were required to find possible meet points. Now, engineers can use Google Earth to study the site and find a meet point within the easement that the provider has been given by the property owner. “We’re able to finalize that piece of the puzzle way up front,” Smith said. “It saves tons of money. We don’t have to put assets in the field.” 2. Online meetings Smith said online meetings are replacing conferences in which representatives from several companies met in person to study drawings. “It’s sped up the delivery of fiber by months,” Smith said. “It used to take six to eight months; we’re probably doing it in four months now. … If the operator provides us drawings, that whole aspect of the design can be done upfront, from your desktop, and that allows the fiber vendors to apply for permitting, finish their designs, there’s no waiting for everybody to get together.” Smith said that he holds weekly calls with all the fiber vendors in each project to understand where they stand in the permitting process and look at designs. 3. Cloud-based spreadsheets Smith tracks his projects using online cloud-based spreadsheets which he said gives customers more transparency and helps Vertex work more efficiently. Vertex works directly for carriers and also for tower companies that are deploying on behalf of carriers. “I’m proud of how we’ve embraced new technologies,” Smith said. “I definitely hand a lot of our success to those technologies and embracing them.” Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Vertex Innovations About Author Martha DeGrasse Twitter Wireless Infrastructure Martha DeGrasse has been creating content for RCR Wireless News since 2011.

In this article, I'll show you the top ten weather templates you can choose from to kick start your own weather app.  Android App Templates  Simple Weather 5.0 This is a simple weather template with two screens—the main screen which contains the weather info and the settings screen to control the units. Along with an attractive layout, its notable features include five day weather forecasts updated every hour, the ability to add multiple locations, and also AdMob integration. This template is already integrated with the OpenWeatherMap API, but you can easily customize it to any other API if you want. Why don't you give it a shot by downloading the APK from the Play Store?  Weminder Weminder is a single-screen app template. It has a visually appealing UI and some eye-catching features including automatic location detection for weather updates, seven-day weather forecasts, and the ability to set alerts for weather information. It's also set up with AdMob and Google Analytics and is compatible with the latest Android version. You are free to try out the app by downloading the APK to see if it fits your needs.  Map Tracking  If you need something more than just a simple weather app, then Map Tracking might fit your needs. This material design app is packed with awesome features such as location-aware weather updates, a speedometer, embedded Google Maps, and AdMob integration. An Android APK is freely available for you to download, so you can give it a try!   Weather App This template is a simple Material Design app with a beautiful UI and clean layout. The app tracks your current location—if given permission—and displays detailed weather information for both the current day and seven-day weather forecasts. You can also search for weather information for any other location. You should really check it out by downloading the APK.  Weather Pro - Météo Weather Pro is an Android template with a unique style and added rich features such as the ability to change the UI theme, seven-day weather forecasts for either your current location or another, ability to change the temperature units to either Celsius or Fahrenheit, and AdMob integration. The app is freely available on the Google Play Store for you to try it out! News App  News App is a Material Design Android app template that is more than just a weather app. It has a weather widget that displays both the current weather information using the device GPS sensor and also the five-day weather forecast. But it also has features like news feeds, authentication (through Google, Facebook or email), notifications, and an admin panel powered by Firebase. An APK is available for download so that you can try it out and decide if it is right for you! iOS App Templates  Simple Weather V1 Just like the name says, Simple Weather is a very simple Swift 3 app template, and it supports all iOS versions through iOS 10. Users can search for weather info by location or use location awareness, they can get the latest four-day weather forecast, and they can change the app configuration in the settings screen. It's AdMob ready if you want to use Google's ad network as your app revenue model. Weather App This template is built for both the iOS and watchOS platforms. A Swift 3 app, it has a simple and clean UI. Users can get the current weather information for any location in real time—both on their phone and on their watch. It's compatible with the latest iOS 10 and watchOS 3.  iOS City Guide - Sleep, Eat, Enjoy iOS City Guide is a Swift 3 app template that offers much more than a vanilla weather app. Apart from the real-time seven-day weather forecast, it's also packed with other features such as live updating information on hotels, restaurants, bars, and clubs. If you want more than just an ordinary weather app, you might want to consider iOS City Guide. It's compatible with the latest iOS 10.  Store Finder  Store Finder is another iOS app template that is more than just a weather app. Store Finder is packed with features such as the ability to locate a store—and it has a weather feature that fetches and displays the current weather information for a location.  Unlike most of the iOS apps in this list, it is written in Objective C, so if that is your language of choice, Store Finder might be the template for you.

More than 250 companies, including Marks & Spencer, Toyota and HSBC have already suspended contracts with Google, accusing the technology giant of allowing their adverts to appear next to controversial content on YouTube. In a note to clients published on Monday, analysts at Nomura Instinet said that the list of those who have stopped advertising includes five of the top 20 US advertisers: AT&T, General Motors, Verizon, Walmart and Johnson & Johnson.

They said that YouTube is capable of introducing measures that would remedy brand safety concerns but that this would not prevent the company from being hit financially. Crisis, brand and reputation management expert Eric Schiffer, told the Independent  that the controversy could hit Google's earnings in the short term.

They will do their best to asphyxiate hate merchants, and in the process, 90 per cent of brands which left will return to the fold within one to three months." The controversy around ads erupted after an investigation by the Times in February found that content from major brands was appearing near YouTube videos promoting extremist views, which were generating revenue for the creators.

So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content,” he wrote. “This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites,” he added.

Across all Google Fiber markets, year-on-year growth declined to 57.8%, from 78.8% a year ago, the firm found. But Google Fiber's video business is still growing amid a rising cord-cutting trend that is affecting most major U.S. pay TV providers.  RELATED: YouTube TV Emerging Amid Accelerating Cord-Cutting Trend In a blog item published Monday (March 27), Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson, acknowledged that the semiannual data from the copyright office “is completely blind to broadband, which is arguably Google Fiber’s more important line of business.” Moffett added: “We would naturally prefer to have data on the broadband market, which, after all, was always Google’s principal aim.  We rely on this data set only because it is the only one we’ve got. Perhaps their broadband results are better.” Update: Google Fiber hasn’t released sub numbers, but a person familiar with its business noted that the unit did double its Internet subs in 2016 compared to all previous years combined that Google Fiber has been in business, and that Google  Fiber has generally been seeing strong growth for Internet-only subs, including those that are coming way of Webpass, which is being offered in markets such as San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, Miami and Boston. Webpass does not provide video service alongside its baseline high-speed Internet offering.   Even without any specific broadband subscriber results to go on, Moffett said Google Fiber’s video numbers still speak volumes about its efforts to make a mark in the broader pay TV industry.  “Seven years after breaking ground in their first broadband market, Google Fiber still accounts for only 0.1% of the U.S. Pay TV industry,” Moffett explained. Among Google Fiber’s largest individual markets, MoffettNathanson found that the company ended 2016 with 45,096 video subs in its largest market, Kansas City, Mo., compared to 28,941 in Kansas City, Kan.; 5,889 in Austin, Texas; and 2,914 in Provo, Utah.  Google Fiber has been asked for comment on the new pay TV data. In September 2016, the last time this data emerged, Google Fiber said it was “very pleased” with its pay TV progress. Late last year, Google launched an updated Fiber TV App for Android and iOS devices that includes a new recommendation and other features. That followed an  upgrade of the service’s TV interface. RELATED: Google Fiber ‘Very Pleased’ with TV Sign-Ups UPDATE: A Google Fiber spokesperson issued this statement amid the new pay TV numbers posted by MoffettNathenson: “We started Google Fiber to make the Internet better. Our super fast service is currently available to subscribers in 9 metropolitan areas, with 3 more under construction or planned. Demand for Fiber speed continues to grow, as more consumers move toward Over-the-top streaming and skinny TV offerings." MoffettNathanson’s latest analysis of Google Fiber TV subscriber data comes amid a shift in strategy there. Of recent note, Google Fiber hit the pause button in targeted expansion markets as it continues to sign up customers in existing markets, and as it more aggressively pursues less expensive wireless technology options following its acquisition of Webpass. Gregory McCray was recently named CEO of Alphabet’s Access division, which includes Google Fiber. RELATED: Google Fiber Pauses Expansion Plans, Laying Off Some Staff The latest figures also come out as YouTube builds the groundwork for a new OTT TV service called YouTube TV that's slated to launch later this year with a package of 40-plus channels and a cloud DVR. RELATED: YouTube Makes Virtual MVPD Play Regardless how the new OTT service and a bigger focus on Webpass impacts Google Fiber going forward, the latest Copyright Office data suggests “that Google’s interest even in its existing markets has cooled considerably,” Moffett wrote, while also pointing to recent reports that Google Fiber issued refunds to some people in Kansas City who had signed up to get service after the company decided not to expand to their neighborhoods, at least for now. “In order to focus our efforts and resources, we’ll be slowing construction in some areas until we can layer in the new deployment models we’re developing,” Google Fiber told The Kansas City Star, adding that it is looking to add customers in areas such as Raymore and central Overland Park.

The only devices which came close were the Google Pixel series and the OnePlus 3T. So, there's good reason to believe 2017's new models will be just as impressive, and will be some of the most desireable devices for the whole year. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will launch very soon and once they’re here things will be very different for Google’s other Android partners. Samsung is essentially the Apple of the Android space; it commands a large user base of loyal fans and these fans are always waiting for the next instalment of the company’s flagship handset, the Galaxy S. Demand should be even higher this year too, after Samsung’s Note 7 exited the market in dramatic fashion last year. This left a lot of potential customers in the lurch and many, I suspect, will have decided to wait out and see what the Galaxy S8 is like. To be frank, we already know pretty much everything about the handset; it’s leaked and leaked and then leaked some more. We know what it looks like, what specs and hardware it runs and how much it will cost. And it sounds like a beast. I'd wager the Galaxy S8 will out-sell the LG G6 by about 4-1; maybe more. Analysts predict sales in excess of 45-50 million.  LG, however, just made the LG G6 official at its keynote event at MWC 2017, Barcelona, Spain. The firm finally took the wraps off on February 26 and, lo and behold, most of the rumours proved true. Samsung will also come out guns blazing with its – apparent – trio of Galaxy S8 handsets. There could be a new, Pro model that will retail for close to $1000 and the arrival of Bixby – Samsung’s new AI – could mean big things for Samsung users. The LG G6 has now been given some prices and it's looking like it could be a good deal cheaper than the rumoured Galaxy S8 prices, if those turn out to be true. The LG G6 will be priced at 899,800 won (US$796.85) in its native nation of Korea, but in the UK, retailer Mobilefun has confirmed an RRP of £699. Not exactly cheap, but that's within what we've come to expect of flagship prices and a lot less than the projected Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 top-tier prices which could been excess of $1000/£1000. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6: Rumoured & Leaked Specs Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumoured & Leaked Specs Display: 5.2in (Galaxy S8) & 6.2in (Galaxy S8 Plus) curved EDGE Super AMOLED, 18.5:9 Aspect Ratio, 4K Resolution Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (10nm) octa-core CPU OR Samsung Exynos 8995 (10nm) octa-core CPU - region dependent GPU: Adreno 540 (Qualcomm Snapdragon) OR ARM Mali-G71 (Samsung Exynos) - region dependent RAM:4GB OR 6GB - region dependent Software: Android Nougat Connectivity: 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Type-C USB, NFC, GPS, Fingerprint scanner, Storage: 64GB OR 128GB - region dependent MicroSD: Yes Primary Camera: 12MP, f/1.7 aperture Secondary Camera: 8MP with autofocus Battery: 3,000mAh-3,250mAh (Galaxy S8), 3,500mAh-3,750mAh (Galaxy S8 Plus) LG G6 Specs Display: 5.7in IPS LCD "FullVision", QHD+ 1440 x 2880 pixel resolution @ 564ppi, 18:9 Aspect Ratio Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 MSM8996 (14nm) quad-core CPU [2x2.35GHz Kryo & 2x1.6GHz Kryo] GPU: Adreno 530 RAM:4GB Software: Android Nougat Connectivity: 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Type-C USB, NFC, GPS, Fingerprint scanner Storage: 32GB/64GB MicroSD: Up to 256GB Primary Camera: Dual-13MP Sensors, f/1.8 aperture with OIS & f/2.4 aperture, laser autofocus, LED flash, 1/3" sensor size, 1.12 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, HDR, face detection, 2160p HDR video with 24-bit/192kHz stereo sound recording Secondary Camera: 5 MP, f/2.2, 1080p video Battery: 3300mAh, QuickCharge 3.0 In terms of crucial information, a key difference of course is that there will be two Galaxy S8 models; the 5.2in Galaxy S8 and the 6.2in Galaxy S8 Plus, both of which will feature curved EDGE displays, while there is only be one flat-screen 5.7in LG G6. In all cases it seems the respective firms are trying to cram as much screen into the front fascia of their phones as possible while keeping the bodyshell size more-or-less the same as the previous generations. This (as well as the increase in new wide-aspect 4K content) is also why both are adopting a much bigger 18:9 display aspect ratio. On the subject of display resolution, the Galaxy S8 has been rumoured with a 4K setup since the beginning, and although there have been a few contradicting rumours since, there’s still enough out there suggesting that at least one of the two models will pack this high-end resolution. The LG G6 will use the firm’s brand new display tech recently announced, which is dubbed QHD+. We can still expect ultra-sharp, high quality visuals from this, but it’s quite plausible, even likely, that a 4K Samsung Galaxy S8 model, also using Super AMOLED rather than LCD, will have an advantage here. On the processor front Samsung appears to have literally outmaneuvered LG here (as well as most other rivals on the market) by dominating the supply of the new-gen of Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPUs. Samsung actually produces these chips on Qualcomm’s behalf, but regardless of whether that has given it an advantageous bargaining chip or not, the firm has reportedly bought up all the CPUs it has produced so far for use inside its Galaxy S8 devices. Samsung has now started teasing its upcoming Exynos 9 chipset, the CPU that will likely power some Galaxy S8 models as well as the Galaxy Note 8 once it drops later on in 2017. The Exynos 9 will be built using Samsung’s 10nm process, just like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Reports suggest the Exynos 9 will feature an octa-core CPU with four custom M2 cores and four ARM Cortex-A53 ones, and the new Mali-G71 GPU. What remains unclear is whether Samsung will follow its usual habit of producing one variant of each Galaxy S model (ie: Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus) for the Asian market using one processor, and another set using a different processor for the international market. Typically this has been a Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC for one market and one of its own Exynos chips for the other, though which chip is used for which market has varied. Some sources say Samsung will just use Qualcomm S835’s across the board this time, while other rumours say the firm is prepping its own Exynos 8995 processor so it can continue to split distribution based on region. However, either way it doesn’t really matter, Samsung makes the S835 on the 10nm FinFET semiconductor process and, if the Exynos 8995 rumours are accurate, its own CPU will also use this same architecture. In other words, as with last year’s Galaxy S7, both the Exynos and Snapdragon variants should offer more-or-less the same performance. Importantly, either variant will probably outclass the LG G6 by a noticeable degree - Samsung’s hogging of the S835 is allegedly why LG and others can’t get hold of the chip for their own devices. LG has settled on a previous-gen Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 CPU on the older 14nm FinFET architecture for the LG G6. While this is still a decent chip, it has half as many cores on an older and larger semiconductor design; the newer chips will likely offer faster performance, better battery efficiency and produce less heat. Qualcomm’s line on the S835 is that, compared to earlier-gen tech, the chip is 20% faster and 25% more battery efficient. LG has optimised the S821 chip and has installed an "advanced heat pipe" and copper heatsink to aid cooling. When it comes to RAM, there’s been plenty of early hubris on most major flagship rumours, getting all excited about the prospect of 6GB and even 8GB of RAM, but by this late stage most of it seems to have boiled down to something a bit more middle-of-the-road. The Galaxy S8 was heavily rumoured to pack 6GB RAM but the most recent rumours indicate that most models will pack 4GB alongside 64GB of onboard storage. However, it appears Samsung will go the route of the short-lived Galaxy Note 7 in providing a 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant exclusively to the South Korean and Chinese markets. The LG G6 packs 4GB RAM. Lastly on the internal hardware spec side of things; the battery. The LG G6 no longer sports a removable battery design like its predecessor, and instead comes with a non-removable 3,300mAh battery with support for QuickCharge 3.0. For the Galaxy S8 series, all the indicators suggest a sealed design. The specifics of the battery ratings vary, on the Galaxy S8 we’ve seen a range from 3,000mAh up to about 3,250mAh, while on the larger Galaxy S8 Plus it’s a range between 3,500mAh and 3,750mAh, so expect figures somewhere within these ballparks. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6: Rumoured & Leaked Design Most of the Galaxy S8 leaks corroborate together to confirm an overall design quite similar to the Galaxy S7 EDGE. A sealed metal and glass unibody is again the order of the day with a broadly similar design language and curved EDGE displays on both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus models; the flat screen is being abandoned completely. Reportedly the curved edges push further around towards the back of the phones to give a truly edge-less appearance, but at the same time the curvature is slightly less pronounced than the Galaxy S7 EDGE, allegedly in order to reduce inadvertent touch input. Contrary to earlier rumours the Galaxy S8 will apparently retain the 3.5mm headphone jack, which is good news. The physical Home key is gone, however, presumably in favour of on-screen controls, while the fingerprint scanner has been moved round the back, sitting adjacent to the camera sensor. There is also a new dedicated key on the side of the phone for the Bixby AI assistant and we can fully expect the Galaxy S8 series to retain its waterproofing certification from the last generation. While LG has dabbled in the past with various “alternative” designs (stuff like leather back panels) the LG G6 is conforming a little more to the trends in being possibly the most metallic LG flagship to date. It’s looking quite similar to the LG G5 in terms of shape and overall design, but much sleeker and shinier, and without the modular aspect. It also has an extremely large display with the thinnest of bezels around the outside. The LG G6 is the first LG flagship to sport IP68 water and dust proofing certification. It's made from aluminium but has a glass back panel made from Gorilla Glass 5, while the front screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3. The phone has plastic inserts inside the frame intended to help with shock resistance, and the corners have been specially designed for durability. The handset retains a 3.5mm headphone jack and has a Type-C USB port, as well as a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner/power key. Volume controls are now on the side. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6: Rumoured & Leaked Features A key feature of the Samsung Galaxy S8 series will be the debut of Samsung’s much-rumoured Bixby AI assistant, based on its acquisition of Viv Labs and its own AI development projects. Allegedly this will be pretty damn advanced, far outpacing rivals such as Siri. LG, on the other hand, is rumoured to be falling back on Google’s own Google Assistant AI as seen on the Google Pixel, although it’s understood that it won’t be as extensively featured as aboard Google’s own hardware. While the Galaxy S8 series, specifically the Galaxy S8 Plus, was originally rumoured with one of those fancy dual-camera sensors that are currently all the rage, most recent rumours suggest we’re looking at something more basic, more-or-less a repeat of the Galaxy S7’s 12MP Sony camera sensor but with a tweaked software package. Still, that’s a plenty capable camera, make no mistake. The front-facing secondary will reportedly be the first to feature built-in autofocus, however. The camera will also integrate with Bixby allowing you to do things like point the camera at a product and then buy it online via Samsung Pay. The LG G6 sports an updated camera from the LG G5 and LG V20's hardware, with both of its dual-sensors being rated at 13MP. One is a wide-angle lens with an f/2.4 aperture while the other is a regular lens using an f/1.8 aperture with optical stabilisation - the duo uses laser autofocus too.  Read More About: Mobile Phones Android LG Samsung Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus LG G6 Sponsored Links Related content Best Places To Pre-Order Samsung Galaxy S8 & Galaxy S8 Plus Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date & Specs Rumours It's Almost TIME For The Nokia 8: Release Date & Specs News iPhone 8 or "iPhone Pro" – New Theory Suggests Name Change Xiaomi Mi 6 & Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus Specs LEAK View the discussion thread.

 Howard University is opening a campus at Google headquarters to get more black engineers in tech Chris Weller Mar. 27, 2017, 11:45 AM 2,653 facebook linkedin twitter email print A member of Howard University's ROTC wears Google Glass. Ted Eytan/Flickr Starting this summer, one of the nation's largest historically-black colleges will set up a satellite campus at Google headquarters in an effort to bring more black computer science students into the tech industry. Roughly 25 to 30 rising juniors and seniors studying computer science at Howard University, located in Washington, D.C., will get the chance to spend three months taking classes at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California. The initiative is called Howard West. Students at Howard West will learn from current Google employees and Howard faculty with the goal of establishing themselves in an industry where black engineers are largely absent. In 2016, for instance, just 1% of Google's technical engineering staff identified as black. Meanwhile, 37% identified as Asian and 57% identified as white. "We'd like to see Howard West alumni matriculate into full time positions in tech, whether it's at Google or other companies," Dr. Wayne Frederick, president of Howard University, tells Business Insider. "We'd like to see Howard West alumni become the tech and business leaders of tomorrow." Students at Howard West won't need to pay any extra tuition to attend, and they'll also receive a stipend to cover their living expenses, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The Chronicle also reports neither Google nor Howard is receiving any money from the other to run the program. Frederick says the initiative represents an important bridge between black computer science students and the industry they've struggled to break into. It's a bridge Silicon Valley has a responsibility to build, he says. "The key is identifying parties who are willing to work toward change and understand the importance of this as a priority," Frederick says. "In this case Google has demonstrated this commitment and we are excited to be working together." A spokesperson for Howard tells the Chronicle that 18 computer science students will graduate in May 2017. By next year, the university estimates it'll rise to 25. Researchers have found so few black students gravitate toward tech-related majors (also including science and math) because of a vicious cycle in representation. "When you're a minority in a particular institution, you are suddenly no longer a student but you're a representative of your entire race," Nicole Smith, the chief economist at the Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce, recently told US News. Often, Smith says, young black students will see primarily white faces in more rigorous classes and assume they don't belong. Frederick says he hopes the Howard West program will break the cycle. "We'd like to see Howard's computer science program grow in popularity and serve both as a beacon and a model for aspiring CS students and other institutions," he said.

It's a gateway to Google's all-powerful voice-controlled assistant. Just like Amazon's successful Echo speaker, the Home can schedule appointments, set reminders and read out the news.

Design Google Home is quite squat - with a shape supposedly inspired by wine glasses and candles. It has a sloped top, with a touch-capacitive display and four coloured LED lights to provide visual feedback, and a single physical mute button on the back, which you can press to prevent Google from listening to "hot words".

There are six shell options in fabric or metal. Sound Google Home boasts a "high-excursion driver" with a "dual passive radiator" design that Google claims delivers "crystal-clear highs and deep lows". That means a lot of big sound from a small package. Google Home speakers can also be synced together, or used to control other speakers that have a Chromecast Audio device plugged into them, essentially creating a multi-room speaker system.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Apple's Siri could get iMessage integration in iOS 11 Listen | Print By James Walker     yesterday in Technology Apple could expand Siri with new intelligent features in this year's iOS 11 update, according to a report today. The company is planning to add iMessage integration for the first time, letting Siri help you write texts by offering predictive suggestions. As 9to5Mac writes, the claims were made in an article by Israeli tech blog The Verifier today. The site reports Apple is planning further improvements to Siri above the features introduced with last year's iOS 10. This time, the company will focus on assisting users to complete common smartphone tasks. Apple will add iMessage integration to Siri, letting the AI help users to create new texts and access advanced messaging features. Details on what the integration will include aren't available but significant clues can be found in an Apple patent filing made late last year. The company has previously described a system that would allow Siri to give suggestions based on the contents of a messaging thread. It could suggest and give directions to restaurants if you're chatting about eating out or provide information on a place that's been mentioned. It's similar to Google Assistant's role in Allo, Google's AI-augmented chat app, and it's likely Apple is attempting to catch-up Google's progress in mobile AI. Apple considerably expanded Siri in 2016 with iOS 10. It now allows developers to add Siri to their own apps, letting you say voice commands to interact with third-party services. The company has aimed to achieve the proactive assistance touted by Google. As Apple prepares to face a new rival in the form of Samsung's upcoming Bixby, the company looks to be readying another Siri upgrade to ensure the assistant remains relevant to users. In iOS 11, Apple will expand Siri's proactive features to allow it to learn from users, The Verifier reports. Siri will be able to study the user's habits and regular patterns, changing the functions offered in response to the activity of the device owner. Everything will be uploaded to Apple's iCloud and synced across devices, preserving context across conversations. You could start an exchange on your iPhone and then resume it on your Mac computer. Cross-device activity resumption is already a strong point for Apple so widening the supported apps to include Siri is a logical next step. Siri's learned information will also be available to tvOS and watchOS devices, effectively letting your data follow you across device boundaries. Apple is expected to unveil iOS 11 at its Worldwide Developer's Conference event this June. Details on the rest of the operating system are currently light. It follows last year's "biggest ever" iOS 10 release which debuted a new streamlined interface and an overhaul of many stock Apple apps, alongside the significant Siri improvements and a myriad of smaller features.

Certainly, when including taxes and checking a bag or two, the price can easily go up significantly. Google knows this and thus has developed a tool that alerts buyers to associated baggage rules. When looking at low-cost options or basic economy fare, you can distinguish what kind of ticket you are buying and the full price you will need to pay. The search tool now makes it easier for people who want to know what kind of ticket they are buying. For example, when spotting a cheap round-trip fare between Dallas and Philadelphia, with American Airlines, you will see the summary where you can book directly through American Airline's website. Google Flights will also display a warning above the booking link and at the bottom of the page that informs you that American Airlines only allows one small personal item for personal basic economy fares. Image source: Google Flights Google Flights also gives similar warnings for United flights. There are no warnings for Delta tickets as the airline offers travelers the option to carry one full-size carry-on, along with a personal item, for free. With Google Flights, you also may see warnings for low-cost carriers such as Frontier and Spirit Airlines, and Google Flights is sure to add any warnings for other airlines that tack on extra baggage fees in the future. Flyers can now know the true cost of the fare with this new addition, all without wasting time when searching for a ticket. Isn't it awesome? If you want to check a bag without breaking the bank, know that some credit cards offer free checked baggage, such as the airline credit cards shown below.

Nexus 6P vs Nexus 5X: The End of An Impressive Era... Vs Michael Grothaus 16:12, 27 Mar 2017 facebook twitter google+ Looking back at the excellent Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P – both of which now have Android Nougat! The decision by Google to nix its Nexus line and focus on selling premium, high-end phones designed within its HQ has been scrutinised to hell and back since the phones were first announced. I was skeptical too… but then I tested the Pixel XL out and it quite literally blew my mind. The handset has an amazing camera, brilliant performance and, best of all, perhaps the best battery life of ANY phone I have ever tested. Nothing can slow this handset down; heavy use yields a solid day and half, while more moderate usage will likely see things progress to two days. Standby is off the charts. Yes, these handsets are expensive. But so too is the iPhone, and this is the market – and consumers – Google is going after. It might take a few years for Google to catch up with Apple, but the quality of these Pixel handsets CANNOT be faulted. As phones they are easily two of the finest specimens ever produced by anyone in the mobile space. Still, if you want still want a Nexus you’re good to go, as the handsets are still available. We’ve even included some deals within this article for the best prices we found online. I still have a Nexus 6P and I still use it from time to time. It works great and will get support for Google for at least another 12 months and once that support runs out it will live on with custom ROMs, so, yes, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, while no longer Google’s darlings, are still very much worthy of investment. For now though, let's have a look and see how Google's latest Nexus handsets compare. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Specs Here’s the specs for the Nexus 5X: Display: 5.2 inches, FHD (1920 x 1080) LCD at 423 ppi Dimensions: 147.0 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm Weight: 136 grams Storage: 16GB or 32GB Memory: 2 GB LPDDR3 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 1.8 GHz hexa-core 64-bit, Adreno 418 GPU Front camera: 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice And here’s the specs for the Nexus 6P: Display: 5.7 inches; WQHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display at 518 ppi Dimensions: 159.3 X 77.8 X 7.3 mm Weight: 178 grams Storage: 32GB, 64 GB, or 128GB Memory: 3GB LPDDR4 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 2.0 GHz Octa-core 64-bit; Adreno 430 GPU Front camera: 8MP camera; 1.4 µm pixels; f/2.4 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP; 1.55 µm pixels; f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold (Japan only) There’s no question about it, the Nexus 6P is clearly the better of the two phones from an internal spec point of view. It packs the excellent Snapdragon 810 processor and Adreno 430 GPU along with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM. It also comes in three storage sizes starting with a respectable 32GB (hey Apple, take note) and includes 64GB and 128GB options. That’s not to say the Nexus 5X is a slouch–it’s a great upgrade over the Nexus 5, but it’s a less premium phone and it shows in comparison with the slower Snapdragon 808 processor and Adreno 418 GPU and only 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Plus it only comes in 16GB and 32GB storage options–and no one should buy a 16GB phone; it’s just not enough space. With specs Google has pretty much hit the nail on the head. It has everything you could possibly want and need on both variants but, unlike it did with the Nexus 6, Google has presented another option for consumers that are looking for more value for money. But how do the handsets' differ with respect to performance? Let's dig a little deeper with some analysis of benchmarks that compare the two handsets in question as well as the newer HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.  The Nexus 6P is the premium handset. It’s the one Google wants you to buy — the Nexus 6P is bigger, more expensive and decked out with better hardware. But what does this look like inside benchmarks? Is the gap as palpable as the price and marketing would have you believe? Let’s take a look. In Peacekeeper, which is a browser test, the handsets are very evenly matched. But when you consider both use Chrome as their stock web browser, this outcome isn’t surprising at all. This trend is also visible with the Galaxy S7 and HTC 10, which also use the same Android Marshmallow-version of Chrome. Where things start to get different is inside GFX, which puts the handsets’ through intensive graphics performance analysis with game-like content, low-level tests measure specific graphics performance aspects (Driver Overhead 2, ALU 2, Tessellation, Texturing). Here we see the additional grunt of the Nexus 6P paying dividends. Similarly, 2014’s Nexus 6 also puts in a fine performance compared to the newer Nexus 5X, which uses less RAM and the Snapdragon 808 CPU, versus more powerful Snapdragon’s and higher amounts of RAM inside the Nexus 6P. And if you’re interested in what the next-generation performance of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 looks like, simply look two rows down and have a butchers at the HTC 10 — it completely dominates everything in this list, including the Exynos-powered Galaxy S7 EDGE. Interestingly, the Nexus 6 really holds its own when compared to the Nexus 5X despite using an older SoC. What you’re seeing here is the power of having an extra GB of RAM at your disposal — the Nexus 6 has 3GB versus the Nexus 5X’s 2GB. In Geek Bench 3, which is designed to simulate real-world situations, it’s a similar picture: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X overall, followed by the Nexus 6. The HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE, on account of their improved processors and higher amounts of RAM, demonstrate their true next-generation status when compared to 2015 hardware with significant all round boosts to everyday tasks and overall performance.   Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Display Besides the internal specs, there's two other HUGE differences between the 5X and 6P. Let’s start with the most obvious: the display. The Nexus 5X has a 5.2 inch FHD LCD with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 423 ppi. The Nexus 6P, on the other hand, is clearly designed for those who want a phablet. It’s got a 5.7 inch WQHD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 at 518 ppi. Size differences aside, the display on the 6P is superior in every way: from its higher resolution WQHD AMOLED panel to its insane 518 pixels per inch. The 6P also features a Gorilla Glass 4 display, while the 5X uses the older, less durable, Gorilla Glass 3 display. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Design The second major way the 5X and 6P differ is in their design. By now I’m sure you can tell that the 6P is designed to be the “premium” model of the two–it’s meant to take on high class phones like the iPhone 6s and the Samsung Galaxy S6. As a result it’s got a quality all-metal body that is sleek and sophisticated. That metal body also allows for the 6P to actually be thinner than the smaller 5X. The 6P is 7.3mm thick, while the 5X is 7.9mm thick. The 6P comes in four colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold–though gold is only available in Japan. The reason the 5X is thicker than the 6P is because its body is made of smooth plastic. That won’t be a deal breaker for some, but for those that want the sleekest phone out there, metal bodies are where it’s at. The 5X comes in three colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice. Build materials and thickness aside, on the whole both devices are very similar in design and aesthetics, keeping that signature Nexus bodystyle with a smoothly rounded back panel and curvy corners. They're quite pleasant to look at, and little accents such as the Nexus 5X's round camera port and round fingerprint scanner side-by-side do have their charm. On the Nexus 6P, instead you have a large bar shape at the top housing the optics, and this does protrude slightly, while the round fingerprint scanner remains in the same place - while the Nexus 6P may be the more "premium" of the two in terms of build quality it has to be said the back panel is a little less elegant visually. Perhaps more important, though also more obvious, is the sheer size and mass of each device though. Of course we've covered this in the display size section to an extent, but it's also relevant in terms of design and handling properties - without wishing to state the bleeding obvious; the Nexus 6P is a MASSIVE 6in phone, so it's going to feel very different to operate and occupy more pocket space, and to be frank this is not everyone's cup of tea. If you have big hands you might be ok, but otherwise, expect a bit of unweildiness. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand (ha) is your typical 5in size and much more manageable for the average smartphone user. As usual, this comes down to personal preference and just what compromises you're prepared to make for the sake of better handling, or alternatively for things like, say, a massive but beautiful display, metal bodywork, and much better battery life. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Cameras Surprisingly even though both phones have until this point been very different, they are exactly the same in the rear camera department. Both phones feature a 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture rear camera that shoots 4K video. They both also have dual-LED flash and laser auto-focus. Where the phones differ is in the front camera. The 5X offers a 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 front lens, while the 6P bumps that up to a 8MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.4 aperture front lens. However, all is not well in camp Nexus following reports of serious issues with the camera.  The glass seems to break for no apparent reason, and it’s not clear what caused the damage, according to one user on Reddit. “Well that was a surprise. For me, and the cat,” johny_rat wrote on Reddit. It was sat on a table next to me when I heard the glass snap, leaving a little snowfall of shavings on the table under it. It’s now continuing to crack away to itself.” “A different user said he reported the same problem to Google, which directed him to Huawei for future guidance,” notes BGR. “If this is a design issue, it’s likely all affected Nexus 6P will be repaired or replaced. Of course, for some people it might be difficult to prove the screen didn’t crack following an accidental drop.” Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Battery & Connectivity As far as connectivity, each phone features exactly the same innards: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, and a USB Type-C connector. The 5X has a smaller battery at 2,700 mAh versus the 6P’s 3,450 mAh battery, but that won’t necessarily translate to longer battery life in the 6P. After all, it’s got a much more power hungry display to run.  In our tests the Nexus 6P had very decent battery performance, even more so when you consider the handset runs a QHD panel. A lot of this is down to the sheer size of the battery cell, granted, but there is also Android Marshmallow’s role to factor; it has a bunch of new power saving features designed to not only extend the battery life of Android phones but also boost their idle performance by quite a considerable margin. Naturally with both phones being sealed unibody devices the battery cells are not removable in either device. The Nexus 6P is the better phone in all regards, including battery performance. In our tests we found the Nexus 6P to rank among the top five handsets of last year for battery performance — it really is that good. Testing battery life in a demonstrable manner is difficult because everybody uses phones differently. I might work a phone harder than, say, your Uncle Tim. But one way of showing how battery’s perform under pressure is through a video-playback test, whereby a video is looped until the phone dies. This is more of an endurance drain-test and, while not representative of everyday use, does give us a good idea of the battery’s overall performance when factor in with our anecdotal findings while roading testing the handset in the real world. And as you can see above, the results aren’t really all that surprising: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X by quite a margin and the newer HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE are WAY out in front. Largely, this uplift is down to better CPUs and more efficient software and power management. Still, the Nexus 6P isn’t bad by any stretch of the imagination. It’s just that this year’s phone makers REALLY upped their game with respect to battery life. And that’s something we can all appreciate. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Price & Verdict The Nexus 5X is £339 for the 16GB model and £379 for the 32GB model. The Nexus 6P is £449 for the 32GB model, £499 for the 64GB version, and £579 for the128GB variant. But as usual, your choice probably won’t come down to price or even internal specs–it will come down to the display size. Do you want a big smartphone (if so, get the 5X) or a massive phablet (then the 6P is your guy). You can now pick up the Nexus 5X for next to nothing on Amazon.  That’s not to say the two phones are similar in other ways–they clearly are not. Spec for spec the 6P is better by a long shot in almost every way.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme AI develops its own ‘alien’ language, the better to mock human underlings AI develops its own ‘alien’ language, the better to mock human underlings By Aaron Krumins on March 27, 2017 at 11:00 am Comment If you’ve ever boiled with inner turmoil at the failure of your Android device to recognize an “OK Google” command, you know AI speech recognition and natural language processing still have a long way to go. In many ways, it’s symptomatic of taking a disembodied, top-down approach to language that treats words as sounds, rather than experiences. However, the folks at the OpenAI group (of Elon Musk fame) have made new strides in creating an AI that uses grounded, compositional language the way we do. This is both inspirational — what could be the dawn of new era in communication — and more than a little alarming. To better appreciate the departure this research represents, it’s important to understand the relevance of grounded, compositional language, as opposed to the canned responses offered up by Siri or Google Assistant. For decades, a faction of AI researchers have insisted that in order for AI to ever achieve something like common sense and an ability to communicate in a non-rigid fashion, it would need some form of embodiment – that is, some experiential loci from which to view and interpret its surroundings. The concept of grounded language follows from this principle and implies the ability to connect words and their meaning with someone’s individual experiences. This is an important distinction. Imagine a blind person who has never seen the color blue interpreting the word’s meaning in a sentence. They have no reference beyond the way other people have used the word “blue” before. This could be likened to how Siri or Google Assistant responds to a query – there is no experiential basis behind the response. A grounded use of language stems from an an entities personal experiences. This is precisely the kind of language adopted by the agents in the OpenAI research project. Compositional language, on the other hand, denotes the ability to string together multiple words to form more complex meanings. Certain monkeys for instance have different warning calls they use to differentiate between a snake and a bird of prey. But their language cannot be termed compositional, because they will never string these together to form more complex meanings, such as “the bird is carrying the snake.” The language developed by the AI agents at OpenAI, though still simple by human standards, represents advancement beyond almost anything seen in the animal kingdom. Even more amazing, the researchers never explicitly programmed this AI communication. Instead, it “evolved” as a response to a reinforcement learning problem. While the jargon can get a bit technical, the OpenAI blog does a decent job of parsing it. The important thing to grok is the language was never defined, but rather hit upon as a solution to a general problem of learning to communicate. This type of AI method is called reinforcement learning, and involves the use of a reward signal to continually guide the agent towards an optimum outcome. It can be likened to the difference between giving someone a map up a hill, and handing them an altimeter and saying don’t stop hiking until you reach a maximum altitude. One approach lends itself to a single path, the other to a galaxy of alternatives. It’s not surprising, therefore, that AI agents developed some truly weird methods of communication – for instance, one in which the length of the spaces between communications came to represent different meanings, not unlike Morse code. At the moment, the AI language is completely non-human, with no English equivalent. And while there has been some talk of creating a translation tool to make the language readable in English, I think it’s worth simply marveling at the weirdness of these new communications. They may represent the closest thing to an alien language we have thus far encountered.

Specifically around image search clicks and impressions. The data anomalies page says the issue started on March 24, 2017 and is still ongoing: Some data for clicks and impressions in image search is being dropped. This is a logging issue, not a traffic issue. We are investigating and hope to have a fix soon. If you filter your search traffic by "image" results, you will see the "note" show up in the Search Analytics chart: There is no ETA on when a fix will be released, and I assume the data is not loss forever but I am glad Google documented it. I don't see many complaints about this within the community, yet. Forum discussion at Google+.

But last week, I guess Gary Illyes from Google was feeling differently when he called out a company for selling links. He did so on Twitter and made sure all his followers were able to see it. Here is the tweet: . @webdirectlinks , how much for a link?— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) March 24, 2017 He put the period before the @name in order to make sure all his followers saw the tweet. This does not mean that this company has been penalized or will be penalized but clearly they are on Google's radar and if I was part of this company, I'd be a bit nervous. The company has not seemed to respond to Gary's tweet. But they are fairly active on Twitter, mostly around thanking people for following them. There web site is pretty much a blank page without much information but I guess that doesn't mean they aren't running a business off of Google's link network. Forum discussion at Twitter.

At least, he said that Google has never done that, on purpose. He added that Google can't lie, if they would get caught, it would be a lot worse. Here is his tweet on Twitter: @rustybrick denied an update that actually happened? No, we never done that (on purpose). We can't really lie, we get caught & that's worse— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) March 24, 2017 Makes you scratch your head - doesn't it? I mean, Google has "no commented" us plenty of times or just not responded or just given the line, we do updates all the time. I guess Google has never said to us that there was NO update on this and that date, so technically, he is probably right. So Google has never really denied that there was an algorithm update when there was. Sometimes they just don't really confirm it or dodge the question but outright denial - probably never.

Home > Google News > Google Updates > Google: Machine Learning Won't Take Over The Google Algorithm Google: Machine Learning Won't Take Over The Google Algorithm Mar 27, 2017 • 8:14 am | (2) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google PageRank & Algorithm Updates Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Last week, during the AMA with Google at SMX West, Google's Gary Illyes said he doesn't see machine learning and artificial intelligence taking over most of the Google ranking algorithms because it is too hard to debug. He said, yes, they have elements of machine learning, such as RankBrain, and other things (he wouldn't say what other things). But he also said that he doesn't seem machine learning completely taking over all the ranking algorithms. Debugging a machine learning process is too hard because machines do the work themselves. If someone hand codes an algorithm, it is way easier to debug issues with that. Here are some tweets from the event when he said this: Going all AI for Google's search algos would be a bad decision because it is very difficult to debug, says @methode #google #smx— Dustin Woodard (@webconnoisseur) March 23, 2017 If RankBrain makes a ranking decision, it is hard to understand why the decision was made. With traditional algo, you can. @methode #smx— Jennifer Slegg (@jenstar) March 23, 2017 Probably wouldn't want an entirely ML algo and ditch the regular one. ML algos are very hard or impossible to debug. @methode #smx— Jennifer Slegg (@jenstar) March 23, 2017 This was not the first time Gary Illyes said this, he said it back in October 2016 as well: Going all-in on machine learning is out of question for Google coz it's impossible to debug what's happening in SERPs @methode #digitalzone pic.twitter.com/pgsJSByp6I— Kevin Richard (@512banque) October 21, 2016 I know Googlers have been saying this for a long long time - but one day - maybe, the Google algorithm will be run completely by machines. :) In terms of what else in the algorithm is run by machines, outside of RankBrain? We know Google Photos uses ML, we know Google Translate does, some of YouTube, but what else in core search? We don't fully know yet. Forum discussion at Twitter.

John Mueller actually spoke about the issue in his Webmaster hangout on Friday afternoon at around 12:50pm EST, which was an hour and a half after Gary Illyes confirmed the update. Here is Gary's confirmation tweet: @rustybrick will. Obviously there was an update. Why would we deny that— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) March 24, 2017 John Mueller at the 53:50 mark into the video was given a Fred quality and in his response, John cited "quality" six times and he didn't spend all that much time answering the question. Here was the question: Since the Fred update, oh my gosh, we’ve seen a gradual decline in our search rankings. We’ve followed all of the Google guidelines so we can’t understand why we’ve fallen so far. We were on top of page two, bottom of page one, (and now the lights are turning off again, because of Fred, Fred is turning off the lights). Any help that you can give us would be great. Here is the answer: Essentially, if you are following the Google guideliens and you are doing things technically right, then that sounds to me like there might just be just quality issues with regards to your site. Things that you can improve overall when it comes to the quality of the site. Which means there is no simple kind of answer, like there is no meta tag that would make your web site higher quality. It is just in general, you probably need to take a step back, get random people who are interested in that topic to review your site compared to other sites to kind of go through a survey to see what you can be doing better to improve the quality of your site overall. And ideally, don’t just like tweak things to kind of subtly improve the quality to see if you can get a little higher. Really take a stab at it and try to figure out what you can do to make a significant dent in the quality of the site overall. Here is the video embed where the Fred Q&A starts: Forum discussion at Twitter.

Business & Tech 15:56 27 Mar 2017 Joseph Conroy 1 day ago It has been revealed that Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Finance Minister Michael Noonan held meetings with Google and Facebook to discuss the EU's 'Apple tax' ruling. Documents released to the Sunday Independent under the Freedom of Information Act show that Google's global head of public policy Caroline Atkinson requested a meeting with Mr Kenny to discuss the case. He briefed them on "the Government's intention to appeal" against the ruling, "on the basis that there was no deal or special treatment." A spokesperson for the Taoiseach added that the meeting, "took place at Google's request to facilitate engagement between the Taoiseach and one of their senior executives - who was then visiting Europe and wished to brief the Taoiseach on Google's activities and plans." Google is expected to expand its Irish operation in 2017. Michael Noonan met with Facebook officials, including chief financial officer Dave Wehner during his visit to the US. He also met Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg informally at an event at the world Economic Forum in Davos. It is reported that these discussions did not go beyond the Department of Finance's previous statements regarding the ruling. The Government and Apple have both appealed against the EU decision which ruled that the tech firm owes the Irish state some €13bn in back-taxes.   15:56 27 Mar 2017 Joseph Conroy 1 day ago 3 Related articles Golf is worth €540m a year to Irish economy Consumers keep spending despite Brexit worries Is religion a money making business – a commodity that can be bought and sold? news cards CT Shirts Moncrieff's Meal Ticket with Mastercard most popular latest sport Meet Ireland's 10 Second Tan "genius" John O'Shea has his say on the Gareth Bale incident Live International Friendly: Ireland vs. Iceland Adam Lallana injury blow for Liverpool site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Google to Meet UK Government over Extremist Content Popping in Search Results GO Facebook, Apple, Yahoo might also be invited to meeting Mar 27, 2017 15:10 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google is going to participate in a meeting with the British government this week, a meeting that seems to have been sparked by the terror attack that took place in London last week.  The meeting will likely focus on the advantages and disadvantages of offering end-to-end encryption to users, something that British authorities have been quite vocal about these past few days, especially as they slammed WhatsApp for not providing them with the last messages sent out by the author of the attack, something that is impossible due to the same encryption featured in the messaging app.  For its part, Google will also be scolded over the extremist material accessible through its search engine, and even on YouTube.  Google has confirmed to Business Insider that it is among the companies that will participate in this meeting with the British government, although it declined to comment further. Although not confirmed, as of yet, Facebook will probably be on the same list of participants, along with Yahoo and even Apple.  "There should be no place for terrorists to hide," Home Secretary Amber Rudd said in regards to the terrorist incident, and more specifically, to the fact that encryption helped hide the terrorist's last sent messages.  The never-ending discussion over encryption There are many messaging apps that provide end-to-end encryption, including Google's Allo, Apple's iMessage, and many others from other companies. This, of course, is the perpetual discussion over whether or not people should be allowed to have complete privacy of their communications via end-to-end encryption. Security experts and tech companies say "yes," while authorities and politicians say "no" due to the "inconvenience" of being unable to decrypt these conversations. In fact, on numerous occasions, people who have been put in positions of power, in the United States and Europe alike, have called for encryption backdoors to be used by law enforcement. This, however, would make billions of users vulnerable to hackers and government surveillance. #Google#London Terror attack#extremist content#YouTube#WhatsApp subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Chrome May Soon Lose "Close Other Tabs" and "Close Tabs to the Right" Options Google Loses AT&T and Verizon Ad Money over Bad Ad Placement Google's Ad Business Is Shaking Due to Ads Placed Next to Terrorist & Nazi Vids Judge Wants Google to Tell Cops Everyone Who Googled One Man's Name Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Samsung Store in Singapore Catches Fire Ahead of Galaxy S8 Unveil All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update RTM Right Now Survey: 93% of Millennials Aren't Quitting Uber Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Latest Black Lab Linux Weekly Build Optimizes Swap File Management for SSD Windows 10, the Only Way to Go: 8 in 10 Companies to Install the OS, Study Shows    Google will meet UK govt Related Apps Inky: Modern-looking and useful software application that enables you to easily and quickly connect to all your e-mail addresses in one login session MailEnable Enterprise Premium: A powerful email server that integrates MAPI connector for Outlook, mobile connectivity, as well as sharing and collaboration options MailEnable Enterprise Edition: A powerful email server software that provides a scalable hosted messaging platform for businesses which need to handle a large number of users Emby Server: A media server that you can use to organize your entire video, audio and photo collection and access it remotely from multiple devices Internet Download Manager: Push your Internet connection to the limits and cleverly organize or synchronize download processes with this powerful application VPN Gate Client Plug-in: A plugin for SoftEther VPN, whose main purpose is to easily hide your online identity via a network of relay proxy servers that conceal your IP address IPCAMSOFT BASIC: Remotely view and control numerous IP cameras from the same window by relying on this lightweight application that packs several useful features Reader comments YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed more on: YouTube i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Published on March 27, 2017. Credit: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Most Popular Fresh on the heels of Facebook's header bidding endorsement, Google is moving to add dozens of technology partners and hundreds of publishers to the open beta of its header bidding alternative, called exchange bidding dynamic allocation, or EBDA. Google is expected to start the open beta by early May, according to insiders with direct knowledge of the program. The company declined to say more about the timing other than that the open beta will begin "in the coming months." Many in the ad tech industry feverishly support header bidding because it levels a playing field that's long been dominated by Google. Header bidding lets pools of buyers place simultaneous bids on ad inventory before Google's DoubleClick gets a shot. Although header bidding has seen significant adoption by publishers, however, it still carries the reputation of a hacky workaround to DoubleClick. That changed last week after Facebook backed the tech, saying it would work with Index Exchange, Sonobi, Amazon, AppNexus, Sortable and Media.net to bring demand from its Audience Network to publishers using header bidding. Related Stories Facebook Just Changed the Mobile Web Landscape With Header Bidding Survival Guide 2017: Ad Tech Turns Digital Duopoly Into Three-Way Brawl Amazon Swings Into Header Bidding With Cloud-Based Service for Publishers Here Are Some Stats That Put The Whole 'Duopoly of Google and Facebook' in Perspective Unpacking Header Bidding: The Road Ahead for Programmatic's Top Trend To put that in perspective, Facebook's endorsement was about as disruptive as an NFL team nabbing Tom Brady in free agency. It gave header bidding more legitimacy and customers while also applying significant pressure to Google and its DoubleClick empire. How Google responds with its EBDA solution, and which tech compaines it adds to its roster (Google was notably missing from Facebook's list of partners), will have a significant impact on how marketers, publishers buy and sell digital ads and video. Will Facebook and Amazon, another major power moving into header bidding, work with Google? Probably not. Is Google going to become more transparent to maintain its dominance? More than likely. And will there be any fees for ad tech companies or publishers? Nobody knows. Jonathan Bellack, director of product management at Google, said the company has been very encouraged with results of its closed beta so far. "Exchanges are building their businesses with improved inventory access, and new players are ramping up their buying or opening negotiations with us weekly," he said. "We are profoundly excited about the potential of exchange bidding to help our publishers improve their yields and exchanges to grow their businesses, without compromising user experience." For nearly two decades Google has enjoyed a programmatic monopoly of sorts, working with nearly every publisher on the planet through its DoubleClick platform, which connects a firehose of ad budgets with publishers' available inventory. It also benefits greatly from its Adx ad exchange, which lets Google cherry-pick the best inventory from the best publishers, often leaving rival ad-tech players at a severe disadvantage. But header bidding has disrupted Google's hold on publishers by introducing a more transparent bidding process that can yield higher ad prices as well. Now Facebook will soon push a torrent of advertiser demand toward publishers that use header bidding, further sapping the inventory that Google gets to sell. "Facebook has adopted a mantra, or code of conduct that they're willing to work with anyone that is transparent and open," said one high-level ad tech executive who asked to remain anonymous to protect industry relationships. "I think that's basically a nice way of Facebook saying, 'We'll work with anyone that is not Google because Google is not transparent." Whether that changes under pressure remains to be seen. "Google has had a kingdom that has been unchallenged for about 20 years, but now they're being aggressively challenged by giants like Amazon and Facebook," another ad-tech exec told Ad Age. "Do they hold on to the end, or are they going to continue to open [EBDA] up and reduce potential gripes so their kingdom remains?" "The answer to that question is a very likely yes, but they haven't publicly come out and explain why," the executive added. Facebook is poised to capture 39.1%, or $16.3 billion, of the U.S. display ad market this year, up from 35.4% in 2016, according to recent figures from eMarketer. Those numbers will increase come 2019, when Facebook will control 43.7% market share, or $23.9 billion in revenue, eMarketer said. Google, meanwhile, will capture $5.2 billion in 2017 for 12.5% market share, down from 13.8% last year. EMarketer said Google's share of display will be 12.3% in 2019.

 Spotify has acquired video discovery startup MightyTV — a sign it's about to go big on ad tech Lara O'Reilly Mar. 27, 2017, 11:01 AM 2,265 facebook linkedin twitter email print The MightyTV team. MightyTV Spotify has acquired video discovery startup MightyTV for an undisclosed price, the music streaming company announced on Monday. The MightyTV app acts a bit like a Tinder for video content. Users swipe through a list of movies or TV shows from video services like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO, and the app then suggests which new ones to watch based on your choices. The company had raised $4.25 million in funding, according to CrunchBase. MightyTV's team will join Spotify as part of the deal. MightyTV founder and CEO Brian Adams has become Spotify's VP of technology, following the acquisition.  Adams is perhaps best-known as being the founder of Admeld, a real-time bidding company that helped publishers make money from online ads. Admeld sold to Google for $400 million in 2011. Adams stayed on at Google as a group product manager and was promoted to become product management director, before founding MightyTV in 2015. Spotify is doubling its investment in its free tier Speaking to Business Insider, Spotify's VP of product Jason Richman, explained the acquisition is another sign that Spotify is "getting really serious" about its ads business. Spotify users can either opt to pay $9.99 per month for an ad-free version of the service, or choose not to pay and be served ads. "The big story for Spotify is us doubling our investment in making 'free' a standalone, standout business. It feels like much of the market looks at Spotify as a premium business model and free as being a path-to-paid," Richman said. "I've been at Spotify for four years and mission one was to keep 'free' free and protect it from existential threats. Over the last year we pivoted to focus around Spotify free as a standalone business and that's what we are really focused on. This acquisition and Brian is a very strong signal towards our investment in this space." As for how MightyTV will help with that investment, Richman explained that "recommendation" is the concept around which Spotify focuses its advertising offering.  "If you think about all the intelligence that goes into making a Discover Weekly playlist [where Spotify generates a list of around 30 songs you may be interested in, based on your previous listening habits], philosophically that's how we feel about messaging of all types and is the engine powering our marketing and promotional capabilities today," Richman said. Spotify started making its audio ad inventory to a larger base of programmatic ad buyers last year, having struck deals with ad tech companies including AppNexus, Rubicon Project, and The Trade Desk (previously it only offered audio ads via audio-specific ad exchanges or via deals directly sold by its sales team). Programmatic is the means by which ad buyers use automated systems to target a large audience of consumers that fit their desired segment — 18-to-35-year-old men, based in the US, in the market to buy a smartphone, for example. Richman said there will be more ad announcements toward the back half of this year. Audio is Spotify's "anchor" format as the company hopes to steal ad dollars transitioning from terrestrial radio to digital. Richman said: "Paradoxically, we need to build audio as a truly digital, cross-platform, native ad product — not just evolve it from its terrestrial radio roots. I say paradoxically because if we don't build a standard that savvy digital marketers find easy to buy, easy to measure, and performs on what they care about, then when the ad dollars start to transition from radio, it's not a default they will go to digital audio. Once they've made the decision, they could go to any other digital format." Spotify's biggest rival for digital ad dollars is Google, which has been rocked in recent weeks by a huge advertiser boycott after brands found their ads appearing next to extremist and other unsuitable content on YouTube. One analyst predicted the fall-out could cost Google $750 million in lost revenue this year.  Meanwhile, other digital ad players — such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Pinterest — are being called on to provide marketers with more metrics from third-party accredited measurement firms. eMarketer Richman said "a few bad actors" have given rise to the ad verification sector, but that the call for third-party measurement and verification has actually helped Spotify, even if it was a little "slow to adopt" them at first. "We are quickly and aggressively catching up to support [third-party verification] and I think there's a real benefit and boon to that. Our audience is logged-in, registered, available across multiple platforms, and our ads are severed in an environment that's pristine. Having that verified by a third-party ... we are verifying what we already know to be true. And having Spotify show up on a spreadsheet with other publishers and platforms — we stand out," Richman said. Spotify grew its revenues by 98% year-on-year to $219 million in 2015, according to the company's most recent financial filing. The company offers a number of ad formats, including homepage takeovers, branded playlists, audio ads, and display banners.

Microsoft brings Cortana to the Android lock screen Posted yesterday by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber’s autonomous test cars return to the road in San Francisco today Following a series of beta trials, Microsoft officially announced this morning that it’s bringing its virtual assistant Cortana to the lock screen of Android devices. Initially, Microsoft had tested putting an overview of your day on the lock screen – offering information like the day’s weather, commute times, flight or meeting information, and more – where it could be seen at a glance. The feature was designed to compete with Google’s own Assistant technology, which also offers similar information. During the beta, users could head into the Cortana’s Setting menu to switch on lock screen integration. This would place a floating Cortana circle logo with “Swipe to Open” on the screen. If you swiped it, you’d be shown your personalized feed, schedule and the other information Cortana offered. The Cortana lock screen integration was rolled out earlier this month, Microsoft confirms, but it’s now widely available. Today, you’re also able to interact with Cortana above the lock, the company says. That means you can ask questions to their virtual assistant, as you could with Siri or Google Assistant, for example, as well as perform various tasks like setting reminders. This functionality could further challenge Google on its own platform. As Google’s only entry in the PC space is Chrome OS, it may be more useful for Windows users to add Cortana to their phones, given its interoperability across desktop, laptop, and mobile – including iOS and Android, not just Windows 10. Microsoft says it has also improved the Cortana home on Android, making the information easier to read, along with other improvements like the ability to quickly add reminders and new calendar items, plus easier access to viewing, editing and adding items to lists. Cortana in December rolled out an updated design on iOS and Android, Microsoft reminded users in today’s announcement. This upgrade had been focused on making it easier to get things done by putting the most important tasks more towards the center of the experience. The default experience is very purple, instead of the blue-and-black of the earlier Cortana look and feel. However, Microsoft added more color options in the weeks after the upgrade, including blue, green, and black. In addition to its U.S. and U.K. availability, Cortana for iOS and Android is also launching in Australia today. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Android Description Android is a software platform for mobile devices based on the Linux operating system and developed by Google and the Open Handset Website http://code.google.com/android Full profile for Android Cortana Description Cortana is the name for the newly announced intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator for Windows Phone 8.1.

 Southeast Asia wants a faster, more personalized web BI Intelligence Mar. 27, 2017, 9:48 AM 254 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Tencent turns to cloud and innovation for growth THE CLOUD COMPUTING REPORT: An introduction to cloud solutions and their use cases Nearly 200,000 apps could be incompatible with iOS 11 This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Consumers in Southeast Asia (SEA) expect brands to provide fast-loading, personalized, and mobile-optimized websites, according to Limelight Network. That’s important because nearly half of the users in this market — which, in this report, refers to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines — spend more than 16 hours online outside of work each week, mostly on mobile smartphones. The report offers several guidelines that will help businesses maximize their reach in the SEA market: Go mobile first. While Western markets are catching up, SEA is a mobile-first region, meaning that smartphones and tablets are the primary devices used to view online content. This means that businesses need to ensure their websites are optimized for mobile, rather than desktop. Aim for personalization. Consumers in SEA expect “app-like” performances from mobile websites, including features like user location, and recommended products and services based on past browsing/purchasing on a site. Sixty-seven percent of consumers want a website to remember they’ve been there before and make recommendations based on previous visits. Use CDN to ensure optimal performance. Having a fast-loading web page is critical to SEA consumers. The plurality (43%) of users said they'd turn to a competitor if a mobile site took too long to load. Content delivery networks (CDN) are a system of servers that can deliver web pages and content to users based on geography, providing faster connections. Provide “fresh and updated content.” Many users turn to the mobile web when they're looking for something specifically, according to Google. This means that brands must ensure that their web content is up-to-date. This could help encourage repeat visits. Forty-six percent of respondents said “fresh and updated content” were the top expectations for website experiences. While the report highlights some shortcomings that brands need to address, Google has been campaigning to optimize websites for mobile for some time. Starting as early as November 2015, Google began encouraging brands to build out their mobile websites rather than focus extensively on developing new apps. That’s because the flood of apps hitting the market resulted in mediocre, bare-bones mobile sites, the company said. Ultimately, the line between the mobile web and mobile apps is blurring as the mobile web becomes more capable. HTML-5-enabled, browser-based web apps and developments in the space, like mobile web browser push notifications, have helped mobile web pages to perform similarly to mobile apps. While the mobile web tends to be device agnostic, it does have a limitation in that it can't leverage specific device components as effectively as an app can. Consumer purchasing preference may move even further toward the mobile web throughout 2017 as Google’s Instant Apps product, which lets consumers access small pieces of an entire app through a web browser, exits beta. Cloud computing — on-demand, internet-based computing services — has been successfully applied to many computing functions in recent years. From consumer-facing, web-based productivity apps like Google Docs to enterprise database management suites, the tools businesses rely on are increasingly moving to the cloud. But developing a cloud strategy is no easy task. Public cloud solutions will likely come to dominate the market over the next decade, but business constraints, such as security concerns and the limitations of existing infrastructure, make it difficult for companies to fully adopt the public cloud right now. That means that hybrid clouds, in which multiple cloud implementations (including public and private) are connected, will remain popular for the time being, at least until these constraints are addressed. The tech giants that dominate the IaaS market — Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and Google — are constantly expanding their offerings to address current business constraints as they compete for market share. Christina Anzalone, senior research analyst at BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on cloud computing that evaluates the current business considerations for the various cloud solutions and provides an outlook on the state of the market. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  Cloud computing solutions have gained traction because they're flexible and cost efficient. Sixty-seven percent of companies used an Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution in 2015, like the cloud, for some part of their business, up 19% from the prior year. All cloud solutions provide certain benefits that are becoming increasingly essential to businesses in the digital age. These include on-demand self-service, rapid elasticity, and broad network access, among others. Security needs, demand predictability, existing infrastructure, and maintenance capabilities are key business considerations for enterprises choosing between cloud implementations. While hybrid cloud strategies will remain popular in the near term, the market is likely to shift toward the public cloud over time. That's because costs are falling, providers are developing solutions that address main concerns with the public cloud, and business practices like agile development and data analytics are dependent on advantages the public cloud provides. However, industries that handle sensitive information, like financial services and healthcare, will likely prefer hybrid and private cloud strategies given regulatory restrictions. Amazon Web Services is the dominant cloud computing provider by market share, followed by Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Because the latter three companies have had little success taking on Amazon, market-share gains are likely to come at the expense of smaller competitors. In full, the report: Explains the different cloud computing strategies and benefits of cloud computing. Evaluates key business considerations – security needs, demand predictability, existing infrastructure, and maintenance capabilities – for enterprises choosing between cloud implementations. Provides and outlook for trends and major players in the cloud computing market. Interested in getting the full report?

A new report claims that Google Hangouts will alert users that they will no longer be able to use the app for texting on March 27. It claims that users will be asked to select a new default messaging app after this. If they don’t have one, they will be taken to the Google Play Store to chose a new messaging app. The change won’t actually stop everyone from using Google Hangouts as a messaging service. Google Voice users will reportedly still be able to use the app for text messaging even after May 22. However, they will get a notification telling them that their carrier number can no longer be used with Hangouts, reports Engadget. Google Hangouts users that are worried about losing their old messages are fretting over nothing. When choosing a new default messaging app, their old text messages will be transferred over from Hangouts to that one. Google has plenty of messaging apps to chose from on the Play Store. The reported decision to remove text messaging from Hangouts likely has to do with Alphabet Inc’s plans for the app. The company has expressed its interest in making the app more focused on productivity. It hopes to set it up as a better tool for business users, Ars Technica notes. A Reddit post claims to have the full email concerning the changes coming to Google Hangouts.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google adds Free App of the Week section to Play Store Software Google adds Free App of the Week section to Play Store By Sohil Nikam - Mar 27, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Google started allowing developers to put up their paid apps at a temporary discount or for free just over a month ago. The move was welcomed by many on the hunt for a deal. Now it seems the company is looking to make things a bit easier for them by introducing a new ‘Free App of the Week’ section to the Play Store. Apple has an identically named section in the App Store. Like its counterpart, Google’s take on the concept will probably highlight a popular game that has gone free for a fixed period of time. The addition has made itself at home in the Apps window of the Play Store on both mobile and desktop. The current Free App of the Week is ‘Card Wars – Adventure Time.’ The new section doesn’t appear to be present in all Play Stores across the world. It’ll likely roll out gradually, perhaps changing the free application as per the market. Also Read: Google is retiring Gchat and replacing it with Hangouts In related news, the Play Store is getting a slightly new look. Search results will be presented differently, providing more information about the top hit by showcasing the app’s screenshots and videos. My apps and games is also getting the revamp treatment, adding one new tab to the existing 3. Instead of just having Installed, All, and Beta tabs, My apps will also have a new window dedicated for applications that have updates available simply dubbed Updates. The All tab has additionally been renamed to library. Users who’ve hoping for more organizational options in the Installed and All tabs can now sort their apps according to last updated, last used, alphabetical order, and size. The changes to the Play Store are apparently rolling out slowly server-side and should reach everyone eventually.

REUTERS By Kaitlyn D'Onofrio / March 27, 2017 A boycott of Google and its platforms that began in the United Kingdom has spread to the United States amid backlash due to advertisements appearing next to hateful and offensive content. Last week AT&T (No. 4 on the DiversityInc 2016 Top 50 Companies for Diversity list) said in a statement, “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s nonsearch platforms.” Johnson & Johnson (No. 8), General Motors (No. 48) and Walmart (one of DiversityInc’s 2016 25 Noteworthy Companies) also announced they would be pulling their advertisements as well. The Times in London reportedly triggered the boycott when an article reported in February that companies including Sandals Resorts, Honda, Thompson Reuters and Mercedes-Benz were among those whose advertisements on YouTube appeared alongside content including pro-ISIS videos and videos for groups with al-Qaeda affiliations. About 250 organizations have since reportedly withdrawn their advertisements from Google and its subsidiaries. For most companies, ads will still appear in Google searches. Meanwhile, shares for Alphabet (Google’s parent company) have been on the decline over the last week. Google, which has never applied to participate in the DiversityInc Top 50 competition, has an astounding lack of diversity in its leadership ranks. According to its own diversity data, women make up just 24 of leadership throughout the company. Ethnic diversity is also dismal, with leadership being 70 percent white, 25 percent Asian, 2 percent Black, 2 percent two or more races, 1 percent Hispanic and less than 1 percent “other.” The DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity, when expressed as a stock index, outperform the rest of the market, suggesting that good judgment in one area permeates throughout an organization. Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets both noted that the boycott is likely to have a significant impact on Google’s long-term revenues. However, analysts with Nomura Instinet calculated that the company could lose as much as $750 million as a result. Business Insider reported: “According to the note, YouTube, which relies extensively on big brands, would take a 7.5% hit to its revenues, which are estimated to be $10.2 billion for 2017. Five of the top 20 US advertisers, which make up 7.5% of the US ad spend, have frozen their advertising with Google — alongside dozens more around the world.” Google said in a blog post it would “be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear.” In another post Philipp Schindler, chief business officer, said the company would be “taking a tougher stance” and said that its current policies work “in the vast majority of cases.” However, companies have continued announcing the boycott even after Google’s “public commitment” — indicating that perhaps its promises do not go far enough. Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP Group, said last week on CNBC that it is no longer acceptable for Google to not take ownership for the content that appears on its platforms. YouTube reportedly receives 400 hours of new content uploaded every minute. But with such massive success and power comes responsibility — and accountability. “They claim the volumes are so great, that it’s impossible to monitor,” Sorrell explained. “With success, with Google and Facebook controlling 75 percent of digital advertising — which in turn is about 30 percent of the worldwide market — with that success comes responsibility, and the responsibility is … they have to exert more control on behalf of our clients, have to take more responsibility for it. They can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’” Notably, WPP has not announced it would get behind the boycott. WPP, which also has does not participate in the DiversityInc Top 50, has a lack of diversity in its ranks as well, with just 33 percent of executive leaders being women. Only 13 percent of executive leaders are “ethnic minorities.” (Incidentally, the company came under fire last year over a £70m pay package for Sorrell, a deal 33.5 percent of the company’s shareholders voted against. According to the company’s sustainability report, “We do not currently collect or report data on pay in relation to gender at a group level.”) Media analyst for Pivotal Research Group Brian Wieser said that the company’s outlined strategy does not address how serious the situation is. “They’re saying they’re trying harder — that’s insufficient,” he said. “They don’t seem to understand the scale of the perceived problem.” In a report Pivotal downgraded Google stock from “Buy” to “Hold” in light of the “serious issues” pertaining to “brand safety.” “Although spending by advertisers who have announced their intention to suspend spending on YouTube and other Google properties is relatively small so far, we think that awareness of the incident will marginally curtail global growth this year vs. prior expectations, leading us to reduce our price target on Alphabet slightly, to $950 vs. $970 previously,” the report states. “[Google’s] approach comes across to us as attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it, which is the standard we think that many large brand advertisers expect,” Pivotal said. “We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover.“ Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said on Fox Business last week, “What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match.” He added that the company has had to “tighten” its policies surrounding advertisements. When asked if the company’s steps would guarantee that ads are not placed where advertisers do not want them Schmidt said, “We can in this case” but added that because “the ads come from everywhere” and sometimes come in violation of the company’s own policies, “we can’t guarantee it, but we can get pretty close.” Get DiversityInc delivered to your inbox and stay informed.

This isn’t available in all countries but if you’re lucky to live in one where the page is viewable, then hurry and take advantage of this good deal.

Google has allowed developers to announce sales and offer them to the whole Android community. The ‘Free App of the Week’ section is officially added to the Google Play Store so these sales can be more highlighted and marketed. Go to the Play Store, scroll down to the ‘Apps’ area, and look for the free apps. You should see this on mobile or desktop. At present, free game available is only ‘Card Wars – Adventure Time’. It’s now up for grabs and yours for free from the original $2.99 premium. We featured this game last year and it was even nominated for the ‘Best Families App’ award at the Google Play Awards 2016.

(AMZN) Sees Groceries as Its Holy Grail Why Bank of America Corp (BAC) Is Becoming a Tech Stock Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Is Still More Beast Than Beauty View All Posts As the weather has begun to warm, some of our best writers here at InvestorPlace have turned a little cautious on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the artist formerly known as Google. GOOGL stock “carries some risks,” wrote Lawrence Meyers. Chris Tyler and Nicholas Chahine recently suggested option trades on the stock, rather than an outright buy, and Tyler even offered a bearish strategy. Even I recently put an “if” in the “Google $1,000” prediction. All these stories were written before the latest news to hit the company. That news is the Google “ad strike,” which is highlighting the Achilles heel of the company’s entire business model. It threatens GOOGL stock, and it will take more than cosmetic surgery to fix. Algorithms Killed the Publishing Star The problem lies in Google’s “programmatic advertising” model, which uses intrinsic targeting to decide which ads to place in front of readers. With an intrinsic model, ads are placed based on the demographics and browsing history of users, rather than content they are looking at. Any website can get the ads, even if your page has a jihadi video on it, or anti-gay hate speech, or something else an advertiser might find objectionable. Content that YouTube will take for upload might not be the kind of content Enterprise Rent-a-Car, which recently joined the strike, wants its ad to appear next to. Between them, Google and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), which also uses programmatic computer-driven advertising, should take 46% of all digital ad spending this year, over $100 billion. The global market for online ads is approaching $600 billion, nearly 40% of all advertising. Google has been aware of the danger for some time, and its efforts to correct it by taking ads off certain sites can be as ham-handed as its advertising policy. That’s because banning decisions are still being made by computers, not by people. People are good at gaming systems, and artificial intelligence isn’t foolproof. The Real Problem Is Bigger GOOGL is not going to get any support from publishers here, because it’s publishers who have been getting killed by programmatic advertising. The whole point of publishing is to create a premium audience, aggregating people based on their location, their industry or lifestyle, and seek a premium price for reaching those people. Programmatic advertising destroys this model, allowing advertisers to pick off readers one by one, buying access to them all at a run of network price.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News YouTube’s better-than-TV pitch undermined by offensive video YouTube’s better-than-TV pitch undermined by offensive video Google attempted to curb the controversy Monday, pledging publicly to roll out new controls for marketers. By: Bloomberg | Published:March 27, 2017 7:27 pm Google also said in the memo that YouTube customers will able to hire “vendors to verify the safety” of ad placements. (Source: Bloomberg) Four years ago, Robert Kyncl, YouTube’s business lead, confessed a mistake. “I thought that YouTube was like TV. But it isn’t,” he said at Google’s annual advertising show. “YouTube talks back. It’s interactive. And YouTube is everywhere.” Kyncl’s message resonated with advertisers. Gross ad revenue at YouTube soared from roughly $4 billion in 2013 to $11 billion last year, brokerage firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. estimates. At the same event in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Susan Wojcicki boasted about taking ad dollars from traditional TV networks. Yet now the same traits Kyncl said made YouTube better than TV have plunged the video service into crisis. Some of the world’s largest advertisers, from Verizon Communications Inc. to Johnson & Johnson, stopped spending on YouTube because of concern their ads could appear next to offensive videos. More big companies pulled back on Friday, including PepsiCo Inc., Starbucks Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. This week, $26 billion was knocked off parent company Alphabet Inc.’s market value. Also Read:  YouTube announces its live streaming service to take on cable TV “I’ve always been suspect of advertising on YouTube. There’s not really great content in there,” said Rob Griffin, chief innovation officer at marketing agency Almighty. “This will dent their long-term prospect of making YouTube an alternative to TV.” While the shift to online video viewing favors YouTube, it is scrambling to reassure companies and ad agencies they’ve made the right decision to spend money on the site, and convince them YouTube will protect their ads from offensive material in the future. Google attempted to curb the controversy Monday, pledging publicly to roll out new controls for marketers. In a memo sent to partners later in the week, Google described more detailed changes, including a new video verification process, long sought by advertisers, and a staff hotline dedicated to brand safety. Another feature Google promised will use machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to flag suspect videos. The new approach would now yank ads if offensive language appeared on a T-shirt in a video, for instance, something that didn’t happen before, according to the memo. Google aims to implement most of the changes by Sunday, according to the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. Advertisers are now urging Google to let outside companies track issues like safe content, measurement and fraudulent ads on YouTube. (Source: Reuters) Even if the company meets that deadline, it may struggle to solve the issue. While TV companies have almost total control over what appears on a given channel, creating a safe space for brands, YouTube opens itself up to anyone who wants to post a video. Advertisers often buy ads across the whole site, or large groups of popular videos, instead of buying ads for a specific channel. The company has safeguards to block offensive content, but the volume of video being uploaded is too great to identify every infringing video. YouTube warned as much in its memo. Forthcoming changes “should give [advertisers] confidence that their ads will not appear against inappropriate content,” the memo read, “albeit with the volume of content involved this can never be 100% guaranteed.” The company noted that four of the forty-eight videos highlighted by news outlets over the past month would, even under the new policies, not automatically disable ads. YouTube decided the four remaining videos, which had religious and political content, did not violate its policies. But it said new tools will help advertisers choose whether their ads run alongside such content. “What they have done clearly is not enough,” said Paul Verna, an analyst with EMarketer. “They must sit down with advertisers and literally show them how they are changing these algorithms.” The duration and magnitude of the uproar surprised most media partners and some agency executives given that YouTube has never been able to guarantee against ads appearing next to inflammatory videos. Yet brands are acutely sensitive at a moment of political upheaval in the U.S., and Europe. They’re opportunistic too. Also Read: More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott Advertisers are now urging Google to let outside companies track issues like safe content, measurement and fraudulent ads on YouTube, according to David Cohen, North American president for Magna Global. Google mostly handles this in-house currently. With traditional TV, Nielsen Holdings Plc surveys households’ TV viewing habits and extrapolates this to tell advertisers and TV networks how many people watched shows. In its memo to advertisers this week, Google said it will offer detailed reporting at the level of specific videos and YouTube channels. That includes “Google Preferred,” a premium service that lets advertisers pair their ads with top-performing videos. One industry executive said this is an important change giving more advertisers more insight into where their ads run. The person didn’t want to be identified talking about a private memo. Google also said in the memo that YouTube customers will able to hire “vendors to verify the safety” of ad placements. Advertisers think they have more leverage now because they are negotiating new deals with Google ahead of an annual ad industry sales process known as Upfronts, which usually happen in late May. One of the biggest concerns among YouTube executives right now is how the video site will be perceived and treated at this year’s event, according to a person familiar with their thinking. Also Read: Bombay HC issues showcause to Google, YouTube for uploading video of ‘sting’ on its judge\ Advertisers have long bemoaned the lack of information they get from YouTube and are seizing an opportunity to extract a bit more, said James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. “It’s a power struggle. If you see an opening against Google, you take it,” he added. However, it’s a struggle that YouTube may ultimately win, because the power in digital advertising ultimately rests with who controls the most viewers. And people are watching more online and less on traditional TV. “The stakes have never been higher in the competition between legacy TV players and digital,” Magna’s Cohen said. “But linear television is an eroding asset.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Google youtube Best of Express Budgam encounter: One militant, three civilians killed; CM urges restraint, Omar calls situation 'alarming' EntertainmentSunil Grover reveals future plans, leaves Kapil Sharma out: 'Tomorrow will be new, yet beautiful'.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Spotify acquires and shutters MightyTV, a content recommendation startup founded by Admeld’s Brian Adams Paul Sawers@psawers March 27, 2017 6:17 AM Tags: Brian Adams, MightyTV, spotify Above: Spotify Image Credit: Paul Sawers / VentureBeat Spotify has acquired MightyTV, a New York-based startup that uses AI to provide video recommendations based on personal preferences and opinions of friends. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. MightyTV was founded in 2015 by Brian Adams (not Bryan Adams), the founder of adtech company Admeld, which he sold to Google in 2011. Adams later worked on the Google Doubleclick Publisher platform before leaving to start MightyTV four years later. As a result of this acquisition, MightyTV is being shuttered with immediate effect, which essentially means this deal was more of an acqui-hire than anything else. Indeed, the MightyTV team will be joining Spotify, and Adams will serve as Spotify’s new VP of technology, with a specific focus on “advertising and marketing technology solutions,” according to a statement issued by Spotify. Adams will be using his “vast knowledge of programmatic advertising and personalized recommendations” to turbocharge the company’s own advertising products. “The content recommendation system MightyTV has built is incredibly aligned with how we think about advertising technology and marketing personalization,” said Jason Richman, VP of product at Spotify, in a press release. “Brian and his team will help us continue to innovate on free monetization and extend our leadership position in programmatic audio.” MightyTV is the latest in a line of strategic acquisitions by Spotify. Earlier this month, it snapped up Sonalytic, a London-based company specializing in music discovery and identification, while back in November Spotify bought Preact, a startup that helps companies acquire and retain subscribers. Spotify has now made nine known acquisitions, a move that started with music discovery service Tunigo in 2013 and was followed by the Echo Nest in 2014 — the latter of these deals has proven to be a key tool in Spotify’s music-recommendation arsenal. Early last year, Spotify acquired CrowdAlbum, a service that aggregates photos and videos from artists’ live shows — this was the company’s first acquisition since raising a new $1 billion war chest. Spotify recently passed 50 million paid subscribers, and the company is expected to aim for an IPO sometime in 2018. As Spotify gears up to go public, reports emerged earlier this month that the music streaming giant is considering putting more limits in place for the free service. If reports are accurate, Spotify is seeking to cut the fees it pays artists and labels for songs and in exchange make some album releases exclusive to Spotify Premium. If Spotify is to go public, it wants to present a robust moneymaking business — and that’s what all these latest acquisitions are about. Spotify wants to differentiate itself from the competition by providing the best music recommendations and to further boost its numbers by teasing new users on board via the free tier and then enticing them to sign up for a premium subscription. But it’s clear that not everyone will sign up for a paid streaming plan, which is why Spotify wants to monetize the free users as effectively as possible. And that’s why the MightyTV acquisition came to fruition — it’s all about improving the Spotify advertising machine.

This planned step was announced by Google due to "a continually increasing scope of misissuance" from Symantec. It plans to reduce the trust on the biggest issuers of security certificates gradually, as well as revoke recognition of their extended versions for a year. Ravi Sleevi, a software engineer on the Google Chrome team, wrote on the Blink online forum that the Chrome developers "no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years." Sleevi has proposed a reduction in the accepted validity period of newly issued Symantec-issued certificates to nine months or less. Furthermore, he also proposes the removal of recognition of the Extended Validation status of all certificates issued by Symantec for at least a year. This will put the company into a lot of pressure, as its customers will then demand a refund. Lastly, Sleevi also proposed "incremental distrust, spanning a series of Google Chrome releases, of all currently-trusted Symantec-issued certificates, requiring they be revalidated and replaced." Taking into account the last 30,000 certificates issued by Symantec since January 19, Google claims that the security firm hasn't done enough to verify the site, and ensure that the certificates are issued correctly. "Root certificate authorities are expected to perform a number of critical functions commensurate with the trust granted to them. This includes properly ensuring that domain control validation is performed for server certificates, to audit logs frequently for evidence of unauthorized issuance, and to protect their infrastructure in order to minimize the ability for the issuance of fraudulent certs," Sleevi explains in the forum further claiming that Symantec has failed to follow these principles. Symantec, on the other hand, strongly opposes these accusations and calls them "exaggerated and misleading", as per a BBC report. The company claimed that out of the 30,000, only 127 were identified as wrongly issued, and that it feels that Google has 'singled it out' over the other certificate issuers that are also at fault. "We are open to discussing the matter with Google in an effort to resolve the situation in the shared interests of our joint customers and partners," Symantec told BBC in a statement.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Mar 27, 2017 at 9:00AM Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is already a dominant force in digital display advertising. eMarketer expects the social network giant's share of the U.S. market to climb to 39.1% this year, as it sells more than three times as much display advertising as its next closest competitor, Google. The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company is expected to generate $5.2 billion in U.S. display advertising this year. But Facebook's ad revenue is largely confined to its own properties, such as Facebook and Instagram. The Facebook Audience Network (FAN) -- its ad network -- generates only a few hundred million in annual net ad revenue for the company. That number could get a significant boost in the near term, as Facebook just announced it's rolling out header bidding to all mobile web publishers. That represents not only a significant opportunity for Facebook to increase its network ad revenue, but a threat to Google's display ad business as well. Image source: Facebook Publishers love header bidding Header bidding is a system that levels the playing field when it comes to selling ads online. Previously, whenever you loaded a web page, that publisher would check ad networks one by one until it found an advertiser willing to pay a reasonable price to populate the ads on the site. Since Google is such a dominant force in advertising, publishers' searches usually started and ended with Google. Header bidding allows publishers to collect bids from multiple ad networks at the same time and receive the highest bid for its ad inventory. As a result, publishers receive more revenue for their ads, and smaller ad networks stand a fighting chance against Google. The more ad networks supporting header bidding, the better it is for publishers. Facebook says publishers in its tests saw a revenue increase of 10% to 30%. Image source: Facebook Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) notably developed a header bidding solution last year in an effort to potentially grow its advertising business. Given Amazon's prowess in cloud computing -- supporting hundreds of major websites -- its integrated cloud-based solution could prove extremely popular with publishers. Now, Facebook is partnering with Amazon and several other header-bidding system developers to bring its ad network to more publishers. Growing the ad network Facebook's audience network still represents a small part of Facebook's revenue. It reached a $1 billion run rate at the beginning of 2016, but that's gross revenue. Facebook only keeps a small percentage of that figure as net revenue. During Facebook's second-quarter earnings call last year, CFO Dave Wehner told analysts: "The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution, as is the Audience Network." That may change later this year, however, as Facebook faces ad load saturation. But with the social network's steady user growth and continued increases in engagement, Facebook's enormousness will still be tough to overshadow. Nonetheless, the growth of FAN will certainly help Facebook offset some of the slowdown at its flagship app. In fact, since the audience network uses the same targeting data as Facebook's in-house ads, Facebook advertisers may be inclined to start buying more ads on Facebook, especially if header bidding increases its ability to win bids on publishers' websites. FAN represents an opportunity for marketers to reach Facebook's audience outside Facebook and even expand beyond Facebook. Management says FAN offers 16% greater reach than Facebook alone and now reaches 1 billion people monthly. The impact on Google The value of FAN to publishers is that Facebook requires marketers to bid the same on FAN ads as on its own ads. Therefore, third-party publishers get the same (presumably high) rates as Facebook. If Facebook's average bid is higher than Google's, it could force Google to lower its take rate from publishers. Last year, Google generated $15.6 billion in gross revenue from its network partners. It also paid out $10.9 billion in revenue sharing to those publishers, about 70%. In fact, publishers' revenue share from Google has increased two percentage points since 2014, when header bidding started becoming popular. Google said that "the increase in Network Members' TAC [traffic acquisition cost] rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying." As more ad sales shift to header bidding and more ad networks like Facebook join the fray, Google stands to see that number continue climbing, unless it wants to lose out on some of that $15.6 billion in gross revenue it generated last year.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Why invest resources in a network entirely dedicated to travel – which most people only do on occasion — when you can use the network you invest in every day to make those same connections? The global scale of Facebook has never been more relevant than with its new City Guides. The network has doubled down on mining its data to create a painless way to plan trips. As Facebook itself pointed out in a statement to TechCrunch, the company has this rich data already: “This content already exists on Facebook, and during this test we’ll be centralizing it in a way that is more personalized and relevant to you. So, this new feature can help people get a better sense of their city, or a city they’re visiting through their friends’ eyes.” Rather than actively ask your network where you should see or where you should go, Facebook compiles relevant data into individualized City Guides. Each user will see a unique list of interesting places within a city, all curated by the user’s friends. Each of these recommendations can then be bookmarked. This simple integration of existing content into individual city pages makes it much easier (and way more fun) to plan a trip on Facebook. City Guides is a response to Google Trips. There’s no denying the value of Google’s standalone trip planning app, which helps travelers “plan less, see more” by automatically pulling trip information into an itinerary and making suggestions for activities. Yet the barrier to downloading a standalone app is high, and Facebook has the most engaged user base in the world. Now that users see recommendations straight from their networks, hospitality businesses (especially experience-based ones, like hotels) must carefully consider how to build themselves into this new travel planning flow on Facebook. Incentivizing the social share Travel businesses, especially hotels and restaurants, have benefited from social sharing since the dawn of the social media era. City Guides places yet more pressure on hospitality establishments to encourage social sharing. Since the guides pull in passive recommendations from a user’s friend, every check-in, status update or geo-tagged photo becomes a soft endorsement of the business. Definitely do not ask directly for social shares, as that can be seen as desperate — or worse, can risk violating the terms of certain platforms. Consider what you can do to make a space or experience more shareable. Is there a mural that acts as a great back-drop for photos? Is there something that can be left at the table after a meal that triggers a desire to share? Is there an iconic moment or look that can be created for your guests? It doesn’t have to be massive – it just has to be memorable. New implications for distribution Hoteliers will quickly notice that there are only four featured hotels above the fold. While it’s hard to know how valuable these organic placements are, the value could be quite high if users adopt City Guides enthusiastically. Each of these cards can be bookmarked, creating a user-defined list that could eventually be targeted through advertising. By delivering a more comprehensive view into a particular trip plan, Facebook could leverage this data for new paid distribution channels. Similar to the way that Expedia’s Scratchpad sets alerts for specific hotels and flights, Facebook could provide a quick-look resource for travelers to monitor for the best deals. These cards also link directly to a brand’s Facebook page. By encouraging more profile views from travelers in the planning phase, City Guide provides an organic lift to direct bookings via the Facebook channel. This is a promising development for hotels, who are eager to drive more direct bookings. Any business can add a call-to-action button to their Facebook page — that’s not a new development. But for those hotels who have yet to do this, City Guides is yet another reason to add a ‘Book Now’ call-to-action button. Large markets stand to gain the most This initial rollout of the new City Guides focuses exclusively on the largest markets. It’s not yet known whether the Facebook Places team will encourage a rollout to smaller markets. This means that those in the largest markets stand to gain the most. In these markets, brands that are benchmarking poorly against local competitors should look to step up their efforts on Facebook. If your brand competes in a large market, do an audit of the City Guides experience on Facebook. Is your brand delivering the most relevant information to those who visit your profile? What are your competitors doing that might be working to pull the user into a booking? Could you implement real-time customer service on Facebook, such as a Messenger bot, that would quickly answer questions of those in the planning stage? Or at the very least, be sure to have the click-to-call/click-to-chat functionality enabled and supported by customer service staff. After all, there are limited minutes in each travel planning sessions. Every minute spent with your brand is one less minute a consumer has to spend with your competition! Yet another reminder that omni-channel matters There is an abundance of marketing channels to manage. Love it or hate it, this is the way of the world. Don’t neglect one channel too much in favor of another. While there might be traction elsewhere, the balance of power can rapidly shift in digital marketing. Maintain your skill, knowledge and leverage with each of your channels so you can dial them up and down quickly, as dictated by the business. Keep at it, and understand that the nuances of how different channels feed into your funnel. Even with today’s sophisticated marketing technology, sometimes it’s not obvious exactly where a potential guest drops into the funnel. So be prepared to engage with them through whichever channel they engage with you.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Nick Vivion Nick Vivion is a writer and strategist.

When asked to rank the top three technology companies, Google was named as the most trusted brand (51%), followed by Microsoft (40%), pipping Apple to third place (38%) Nick Ismail More than half (57%) of UK consumers regularly use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the home, with one in ten saying they use the self-learning technology all the time, according to a recent survey. Still, many consumers are unaware of AI’s influence at home and in the workplace. Nearly half of consumers (43%) claim they never use AI in the home and over half of the respondents (56%) say they do not use AI in the workplace, despite high adoption of AI-assisted technologies and applications. This is according to the State of AI 2017 report, commissioned by AI software company InsideSales.com, which explores consumer attitudes towards AI technologies at home and in the workplace. Japp Zuiderveld would disagree with this, however, as he suggested to Information Age in our Innovation Spotlight series that everybody uses artificial intelligence ‘without knowing it’. >See also: Everybody is using artificial intelligence ‘without knowing it’ The survey revealed that nearly one in ten business users dislike or hate the use of AI at work (9%), with 39% claiming AI will limit their jobs prospects. Meanwhile, nearly one quarter of consumers (24%) said AI in the workplace means that they will likely be working with robots as their co-workers or even their boss. “The use of AI at work continues to be controversial as many people are concerned about the impact this technology may have on their careers,” said Martin Moran, managing director of international at InsideSales.com. “However, we are seeing a growing acceptance of AI and many people acknowledge the benefits of AI can have in our lives. Interestingly, consumers are more receptive to the use of AI when it is seamlessly integrated into their everyday applications, not as a physical robot.” “Medical advancements, robots taking over dangerous jobs, automation of mundane tasks are some of the key benefits that AI can bring to people in all walks of life. Many in the UK have also wised up to the idea that AI offers huge potential in key industry sectors, from engineering to customer service, from marketing to sales.” A love-hate relationship with AI UK consumers have a love-hate relationship with AI technologies. While scepticism of AI remains high, with four in ten people (38%) said they don’t trust AI, there is a growing acceptance that AI can deliver real value in a number of areas: • 40% trust AI to recommend personal entertainment; • 27% trust products or goods made by automated industrial machines; • 25% trust automated sales processes; • 17% trust medical diagnostics that rely on AI technologies. With nearly seven in ten people (67%) claiming to be heavy smartphone users outside work, it comes as no surprise that 50% of respondents regularly use navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze. >See also: AI and automation will be far more significant than Brexit Video streaming services such as Netflix (50%) and music streaming service like Spotify (42%) are also favourable amongst UK consumers. Other popular AI-assisted technologies include smartphone assistants like Siri, Google Now and Cortana (37/5) and personal fitness devices like Fitbit (26 per cent). Consumers also know the companies they trust to lead the AI transformation and deliver AI technology that really works. When asked to rank the top three technology companies, Google was named as the most trusted brand (51%), followed by Microsoft (40%), pipping Apple to third place (38%). Untapped potential in enterprise AI While the majority of respondents (53%) have no strong opinion about the use of AI in the workplace, six in ten people (56%) claim they have never used AI at work. However, overall business attitudes towards AI in the workplace remain positive. For those who endorse the use of AI in the workplace 38% also believe AI will create more job opportunities for them, while 21% of respondents are confident that AI will not affect the number of jobs available. Two in ten (22%) added that they see no fundamental impact in how AI will transform the workplace in ten years’ time, while six in ten respondents (61 per cent) see the value of using AI to streamline day-to-day processes. Yet, one in ten (15%) remained reluctant towards the introduction of AI in the workplace, while four in ten respondents believed AI will decrease the number of jobs available to them. “The reluctance to adopt AI technologies in a business setting can significantly impact an organisation’s ability to innovate and make a sale in an increasingly competitive market,” said Moran. “With Brexit on the horizon, companies must reassess their business strategy and ensure their employees have the right tools and support to succeed. “Productivity remains a huge challenge for many businesses. The UK government’s commitment to invest in disruptive technology is a positive move in plugging the gap but the onus is on individual businesses to make a change. Challenged by demanding customer expectations and economic uncertainties, AI has a huge potential to help business leaders find new ways to motivate employees and propel the business forward.” High potential in AI despite lack of trust Despite their hesitations, consumers agree that AI will have a significant impact on the future. Among those surveyed, 46% believed AI will be key to automating completion of dangerous jobs. Other improvements can be expected in the automation of mundane tasks in work lives (36%), advancements in transportation and travel (36%) and medical advancements (36%). >See also: AI can transform the medicinal industry Additionally, 24% said they believed AI will accelerate processes and increase revenue for businesses, while 12% considered AI to be beneficial for improving elder care and social interactions. When asked which business setting is most likely to benefit from AI, UK consumers believe the top three areas are engineering (45%), administration (40%), and customer service (31%). A parallel survey of nearly 2,000 Americans revealed essentially identical attitudes toward, and degrees of acceptance of,  AI to those in the UK survey.

Google has traditionally struggled with cameras on their Nexus devices, but with the Pixel, they did a great job. In a new entry on the Google X blog, we learn more about how the team created the camera. The secret behind the Pixel camera is software called “Gcam.” The project goes all the way back to 2011 as a concept camera for Google Glass. The technology eventually became much more and made its way to the camera apps on the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 as well as Photos and YouTube apps. Gcam augments camera hardware with a technique called “image fusion.” It takes a rapid sequence of photos and fuses them together to create one high-res image. This was important for the tiny sensor on Google Glass, but it also works wonders on phones with larger sensors. So next time your Pixel takes a nice shot, thank Google Glass. local_offer    Google Glass   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (28) stars Further Reading LG G6 versus Google Pixel: camera shootout How to install Android O Dev Preview Some Pixel owners reporting mic hardware defect Rumor says Pixel 2 won't have a headphone jack The March security update is released for the Verizon Pixel stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertGalaxy S8 leaks show multiple angles closeHere’s the Galaxy S8 from almost every angle imaginable In case you haven’t gotten enough of the Galaxy S8, here’s another set of photos to get you excited for next week’s unveiling. 2 more_vertHere are some high-quality shots of the Galax closeHere are some high-quality shots of the Galaxy S8 Plus A new series of images show off various interface aspects of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT COMPANIES YouTube advertising mess could cost company $750m by Gordon Hunt 1 day ago3 Shares YouTube. Image: MIND AND I/Shutterstock The ongoing problems that YouTube is experiencing following a raft of companies pulling their advertising could end up costing the Google-owned company big time. Earlier this month, British government agency adverts began cropping up on extremist videos on YouTube. Content from the likes of the Home Office, the Royal Navy and BBC appeared on the controversial videos, with the decision to cancel advertising catching on quite fast. By last week, advertisers such as McDonald’s, Toyota and Audi had pulled their ads after similar concerns. AT&T and Verizon soon followed, joined by pharma groups GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson. In total, five of the top 20 US advertisers have boycotted YouTube, as well as other global brands, numbered in the dozens. Analysts at Nomura Instinet have now claimed that the final cost for YouTube owner Google could be as high as $750m. The total drop in revenues could represent 7.5pc of YouTube’s total income, though, given the speed with which the companies have cut ties with the video-sharing giant, and the size of the figures involved, conformity among analysts’ fears is difficult to spot. For example, last week, Morgan Stanley claimed that the companies boycotting YouTube make up 10pc of net revenues, with millions of clients making up the bulk of the company’s income in this area. At the same time, RBC Capital Markets reported that if a 10pc decline hit YouTube and Google Display Network revenues, it would reduce Google’s overall income by just 1.7pc. Earlier this week, Google responded with a lengthy post from its chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, who said that YouTube was deeply apologetic for this issue. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us. That’s why we’ve been conducting an extensive review of our advertising policies and tools, and why we made a public commitment last week to put in place changes that would give brands more control over where their ads appear.” YouTube. Image: MIND AND I/Shutterstock Related: Google, YouTube, advertising, video Gordon Hunt is a journalist at Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Life YouTube confirms users watch 1bn hours of video a day 28 Feb 20179 Shares Hiring Now Informing, entertaining and connecting the world Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share Fidelity International: A truly unique proposition The largest employer in northwest Ireland Companies Mobile ads and YouTube drive Alphabet revenues to $26bn in Q4 27 Jan 20174 Shares Companies Advertiser exodus from YouTube grows to include AT&T, Verizon and GSK 5 days ago24 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 March 2017 by Military News IronPlanet Enhances e-Commerce Offerings with Latest Version of its allEquip Format PLEASANTON, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–IronPlanet®, a leading online marketplace for selling and buying used equipment and other durable assets, today debuted its next generation allEquip® fixed and negotiated pricing format. In response to growing demand, IronPlanet has launched an enhanced version of its successful allEquip format, which includes the ability to run multi-unit listings and allows the company to increase sales volumes across a wider range of equipment categories, including parts and attachments. IronPlanet has also integrated the new allEquip format with “Google Shopping,” providing additional exposure for listed items. Google shopping is a rapidly growing Google advertising product that supports fixed price items. The integration allows Google to select items from IronPlanet’s allEquip product feed to showcase to its search users. “Since last November, we have had tremendous success with the re-launch of allEquip across our marketplaces. Gross Merchandising Volume for the new format is growing at 100% month-over-month and has already surpassed the Daily Marketplace reserve auction model,” said Matt Ackley, IronPlanet Chief Marketing Officer. “The format works for both large and small items, the highest value item was a 1998 Manitowoc 222 Lattice-Boom Crawler Crane which sold for $200,000,” continued Ackley. “The next generation allEquip format is yet another step forward in our efforts to improve and expand e-commerce for the heavy equipment industry, creating a retail-like experience for our 1.7 million registered users. With the upgraded allEquip format we are giving buyers access to an even wider range of the equipment, when they need it, and at prices and volumes that suit their specific demand. At the same time, we are also providing sellers with more options than ever to connect with buyers to sell their heavy equipment and parts.” IronPlanet’s upgraded allEquip enables sellers to: Control revenue and increase the speed of cash recovery, take advantage of Make Offer functionality to provide maximum flexibility for the disposal of equipment, fully configure price, create multi-unit listings and offer thresholds and duration. In addition, sellers can offer listings in parallel on their own website or other channels simultaneously, receive potential exposure via Google Shopping, control the negotiation process to limit communication burdens, get full access to offer data to better understand marketplace dynamics, market to IronPlanet’s 1.7 million registered users worldwide and rely on the full support of IronPlanet’s inside sales team. The enhanced allEquip enables buyers to: Access an even larger and constantly changing selection of quality equipment, shop a fixed and negotiated pricing format that takes variability and pricing risk out of the purchase process and buy confidently with IronPlanet’s IronClad Assurance® equipment condition certification and full inspection reports, unique to IronPlanet. “Our company is successfully selling construction equipment on the new allEquip platform at IronPlanet. The process was smooth and easy. We have the ability to easily log into our account and check the bids on a daily basis, allowing us to make decisions on offers received,” said Roger Hixson, Vice President of Maintenance, Guy M. Turner, Inc. “We also had an entire marketing team market the units supported by a global inside sales division. Selling our equipment online is a great opportunity for us to reach a wider audience and achieve the results we need outside of a traditional auction environment. This new platform ultimately allowed us to control the process while taking advantage of state of the art technology. We are looking forward to continuing to use allEquip to manage the disposition of our assets.” IronPlanet’s upgraded allEquip with Make Offer functionality is now available in the IronPlanet, GovPlanet and TruckPlanet marketplaces, along with its traditional online and onsite auctions.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Verizon-Verizon+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ Ever since Google released the February Android security build for the Pixel and Pixel XL, owners have been experiencing Bluetooth issues left and right. A little over a month ago, Google acknowledged the problem and stated that a solution is being worked on. It was four days ago that the awaited fix came, and it didn't even require Pixel owners to download a system update, since it was a "server-side" solution, as Google puts it. However, judging by the myriad of Pixel and Pixel XL owners who are complaining on Google's product forums from still experiencing drops in Bluetooth connectivity, it seems that the annoying bug hasn't been put to rest for good Apparently, the nature of issue has slightly changed for some users, one stating that "while my Bluetooth may not disable automatically, it still disconnects from my Garmin smartwatch and stays disconnected." Others are also complaining that their connection simply drops, without Bluetooth itself being disabled, whereas before the feature switched off on its own and seemingly at random. Google has not yet issued an official statement regarding the ongoing Bluetooth connectivity issues affecting its in-house developed phones. More information is bound to come in the coming days and we will keep you updated. source: Google Related articles: Google finally fixes Bluetooth connectivity issues on the Pixel and Pixel XL 23 Mar 2017 Pixel users won't have to download any updates since the issue has been fixed by making changes on the...

Why? posted on yesterday, 08:24 0 Reply 2. Cat97 (Posts: 71; Member since: 02 Mar 2017) You could have run Nougat on your unlocked S7/Edge since like 3 months ago, and beta since like 5 months ago, without even rooting or tripping the Knox flag. I am doing this with my unlocked S7 Edge, and it works great. You just have to download the official image and flash it to your phone. posted on yesterday, 10:55 0 Reply 3. omnitech (Posts: 259; Member since: 28 Sep 2016) Why would it get ink?

This makes it more parallel to Apple’s App Store, which employs a similar concept.  ( Play Store ) Advertisement There's no one who'll balk at the idea of free stuff, especially when it comes to apps. The Play Store, for instance, holds a trove of free apps, but is notorious for hosting crapshoots and duds here and there, hobnobbing with more refined and decent titles. While that issue is another conversation altogether, Google is at least making it easy for people to find premium games that can be downloaded for free for a limited period. Play Store's Free App Of The Week Section A ''Free app of the week" section will now be a staple element of the Google Play Store, which is a much-needed, if a little late, feature. We've all experienced seeing a previously priced game being offered for free for a limited time only, and such a catch feels a delight. Actively keeping an eye out for paid apps, however, is not exactly easy. Combing through the Play Store's breadth of titles proves near impossible. This makes Google's decision to add a special free app of the week section a huge help for users looking to snag great deals on apps. For this week the free game is Cartoon Network's Card Wars - Adventure Time. This title is normally priced $2.99, but it's now available to download for free, kicking off the free app of the week section. There's no assurance, however, that the free weekly apps will always be games, but it certainly convinces people to keep an eye out for the section each week just in case a good app sheds its price point. How To Access Free App Of The Week On Play Store To access the section on mobile, scroll through the Play Store 'Apps' page until you find it. You won't have to look that hard, anyway, as Google appears to be making it very visible to users, giving it its own custom banner, as dictated by the free app. This section may also be accessed the same way on the desktop version of the Play Store. While a free section is great, it's worth noting that there's no guarantee if it'll be a game you'd actually want to download. But hey, nothing beats the low, low price of free. By contrast, Google's rival digital store, Apple's own App Store, has been employing a similar concept for a while now. Google just didn't jump on that bandwagon until now. Granted, Google's version is still looking pretty limited, but the feature is, to be fair, in its early days. It's easy to imagine that Google could spruce it up a bit more and even designate a full-fledged paid-to-free section that's much easier to spot and navigate. It's worth noting that the section will only be visible in select markets, which is a shame. Even so, the game featured will still be free if users search for it manually, which is an odd choice. Card Wars - Adventure Time's sale ends in five days until a free new app comes along. Thoughts about Google's new free app of the week section on the Play Store?

It’s called the Pixel – the Pixel XL, in this context – and it is utterly amazing Rating:  5 Typical Price:  £719.00 Pros:  Excellent Camera; Insane Battery Performance; Brilliant Software; Great Call Quality; Zero Lag; No Bloatware; Google Assistant ROCKS Cons:  The Price; The Design Is A Tad Dull Verdict:  The software is amazing. The camera is stunning. The battery life is beyond belief. You get free storage for ALL your pictures and videos. Google offers 24/7 round the clock support, meaning any issues can be resolved right away, and Google Assistant is the smartest Personal Assistant available inside a phone right now. If you love Android, buy this phone. If you want market-leading battery performance and a brilliant camera, buy this phone. Nothing else compares. I used to be a Nexus purist. Not anymore. Now I am a Pixel purist. facebook twitter google+ The Google Pixel has usurped the Nexus line as the new king of the Android space, and the lead models in Google's new stable are the Pixel and Pixel XL. The Nexus line-up is still being supported, officially, by Google's software division; it'll continue to get Android updates for a time, as well as security patches, but apart from this, Pixel is where it's at as far as official Google hardware is concerned. So what's the story here? Well essentially it's business as usual; like the Nexus series, the Pixel and Pixel XL have been designed and put together by HTC but under the close and watchful eye of Google. As before, it's intended as a showcase of the latest version of Android (Nougat) and its capabilities - raw, pure, and unadulterated as Google intended it, with no glossy overlays or anything of that sort. It's also supposed to be a perfect, optimised union of software and hardware running as efficiently as possible, sort of like Google's equivalent to Apple's iPhone; carefully controlled and precision engineered. However, this is arguably where the Pixel starts to outpace the old Nexus line-up. Where the Nexus series was largely a favourite of smartphone afficionados and techy types who love to tinker, side-load, develop their own software, and generally futz around with their own little bespoke tech universe, the Pixel is intended, again like the iPhone, to have mass consumer appeal. It's a bit tidier, a bit sexier, and a bit more polished. Part of this is in going furter with the bespoke features that ONLY Pixel handsets will feature, things like a very advanced implementation of the Google Assistant AI. Other phones may make use of Google Assistant, but none will be so closely merged into the Android experience as on the Pixel. Google has confirmed that, like the Nexus series, the new Pixel phones will be officially supported with the latest Android software updates for two years after launch, with three years of support for security patches. On Google's "Check & update your Android version" page, the company details that Android support will last for the current gen of Pixel phones until October 2018. "Pixel phones get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device became available on the Google Store. After 2 years, we can't guarantee additional updates." So, does the Google Pixel XL do enough to earn its place at the head of the table? Google Pixel XL Review: Design A lot has been said about the design of the Pixel phones. Most of it not good. The visuals are pretty pedestrian. There’s nothing too eye-catching or impressive about either handset. The only real point of interest is the two-tone paneling work on the back of the device. Beyond this it just looks like a phone. Not a bad-looking phone, but nothing particularly exciting either. But this isn’t what the Pixel XL is about. Well, that’s my opinion, anyway. I think this phone about Android and nothing else. Everything on the front, save for the annoyingly large bezels, is designed to simply get out of the way and let you get stuck into Android’s guts and features. I’m not a huge fan of the design, basically, but then again I don’t like the way the PS4 looks but that hasn’t exactly stopped me from using it. The Pixel XL is fairly large at 75.7 x 154.7 mm. It felt even larger to me as I came into this review from an iPhone SE. Still, I’m pretty used to using phablets as they have been my phone of choice for years, so it didn’t take long to re-adjust. I like that Google put the fingerprint scanner on the back again and I also like that it didn't get rid of the headphone jack. Beyond this the rest of the phone is pretty much as it looks in pictures: big, shiny and not all that interesting. The two Pixel phones are more or less identical with respect to core specs as well. The smaller Pixel has a 1080p display, a smaller battery but same internal specs and hardware and, importantly, the same camera and imaging capabilities. I like this aspect of Google’s Pixel campaign; Apple’s iPhones are too different these days and the reason for this is very simple: Apple wants you to buy the more expensive model, which, for all intents and purposes, is the vastly superior model as well. Rather than take this approach, Google has opted to keep things simple: at its core the choice between the two Pixel phones depends on your preference on size. After this, other considerations include battery performance; the XL model’s battery performance is a lot better than the smaller model, for instance. The only real downside to these phones, if you could call it a downside, is their all too pedestrian styling. They’re not eye-catching phones, nor do they look like expensive phones either. They're smart enough, don’t get me wrong, it just doesn't have the majesty of Samsung's Galaxy S7 EDGE or the uniqueness of the Nexus 6P. It still functions perfectly in the hand and it still feels premium. It’s just not particularly eye-catching, though, for me, this isn’t exactly a deal breaker. I’m more concerned with the software, cameras, and performance. Update: Android 8.0 "Oreo" Leaks Of course it was a given that another build of Android would be coming this year, version 8.0, Android "O", which will apparently be another branding tie-in like Android Kit-Kat. This time it's Android "Oreo", named after the layered cookie, according to rumours. We can also pretty much guarantee that the 2016 Pixel and Pixel XL will get the update very early doors, indeed they will likely be the first devices to be updated straight from Google's servers when the new version arrives. That said, it's also likely Google will debut the software on a new 2017 range of Pixel phones as well. At present there are no details about what Android O will feature, but there is at least a strong case for the Oreo name. Following existing rumours, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS and Google Play, Hiroshi Lockheimer, tweeted a gif of an Oreo-based cake. It's not a 100% confirmation, and he could just be messing with the hype train, but it's very tempting to believe it may just be true. Google Pixel XL Review: What About The Google Pixel? Is there any difference between Google’s new handsets, save for the size of the actual phone? No – none whatsoever. The Pixel is exactly the same handset with exactly the same internal spec, save for batteries – the Pixel XL’s is larger. The only REAL difference you will notice is the display size and resolution; the smaller Pixel handset has a 5in AMOLED panel with a 1080p resolution. Full HD might sound disappointing to some, but it’s worth remembering that equates to a pixel density of 441 ppi. The Pixel XL has great battery life, but the smaller Pixel, thanks to its less-power-hungry display, is even better. Light users could potentially get two day’s worth of use from a single charge. Last time I checked, that was considered very impressive and it trumps just about everything else on market in this regard, proving once again that having full control over software and hardware, as Google does with these phones, yields very impressive performance results, indeed. Like the Pixel XL, there is no MicroSD support on the smaller Pixel handset. Ditto OIS in the camera. For the price, Google should have included OIS and also made the handset water-proof. The latter aspect is by far one of the Pixel range’s biggest goofs. I mean even Apple’s iPhones are now water proof! The company has taken a lot of flack for this aspect too, though, speaking personally, I don’t actually view either as a deal-breaker. Sure, OIS in water-proofing would have been a nice inclusion on a handset this expensive, but the omission doesn’t really detract from the overall performance of these phones in a day to day setting. Also: I think most of us are now conditioned, through years and years of phone use, not to drop out handsets in bodies of water. I know I am. Google Pixel XL Review: Display The Pixel XL packs in an AMOLED QHD display that is bright, punchy and vivid. Google has not scrimped on anything in this regard and using the Pixel XL, day in, day out, is an absolute pleasure. At 5.5in it is well inside phablet territory like Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, its nearest rival, and like Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus the handset itself is more than a handful. Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus is still only 1080p, however, and this is where the Pixel XL steams ahead because not only is it using screen technology – AMOLED – that Apple will use next year, it has has a higher resolution and this makes looking at anything on it a vastly superior experience, regardless of Apple’s command of the colour gamut aboard its latest handsets. I’m not too fussed about 1080p vs QHD, if I'm 100% honest. I’ve been using the iPhone SE for months now and pretty much enjoyed most of my time with it. QHD is great when you have it, but it is not a necessity – especially if it comes at the expense of battery performance. Normally this is the case. However, Google has managed to remedy this via some sort of black magic, ensuring market-leading battery performance from the Pixel XL. For me, this is a game-changer. Not only do you have a supremely bright and detailed display, but you also have INSANE battery life, the likes of which must be experienced to be believed. Images, webpages, video and text all look amazing on the Pixel XL’s expansive 5.5in panel. Like the Galaxy S7 and LG G5’s display, it is a joy to behold, a joy to use and a marvel when compared to what you get on Apple’s smaller iPhones. Google Pixel XL Review: Specs & Features This is where the Pixel XL REALLY does come into its own. Not only does it run an exclusive, Google-designed version of Android Nougat but it is also the first smartphone on the planet to run Qualcomm’s latest, greatest and VR-enabling Snapdragon 821 CPU. I expected things to be smooth and potent, but nothing prepared me for just how good the Pixel XL would be – it is unlike any Android phone I have ever used. Menus. Scrolling. Apps. Everything is lightning fast. Now, some of this is down to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 CPU and the copious amount of RAM included inside the Pixel XL. But a lot of it is to do with Google’s increased control over the software and hardware. As Apple has proven for years, if you’re in control of everything you can eke out more performance from a handset, a process that is done by ensuring the hardware – CPU, RAM, etc – works seamlessly with the software, Android Nougat. Google knows Android better than anyone else and when you use the Pixel XL the command Google has over its OS becomes all the more clear.

Really Blue Quite Black, Very Silver. Really Blue Pound for pound, the specs aren’t anything to get too excited about. Yes, the Pixel XL is one of the most powerful Android phones on the planet. But, so what? It’ll be usurped next week by someone else. That’s just how it works in the Android space. But what WILL separate the Pixel XL apart from the “other” Android phones is that its performance will ALWAYS be better. Why? Simple: Google built this phone. It clearly knows what it’s doing, as this phone feels about 10X faster than nearly every other Android phone I’ve tested this year – including the Samsung Galaxy S7, Note 7 and HTC 10. And the only reason that I can think of for why this might be the case is the level of attention Google has put into developing this phone as a seamless piece of technology. The traditional way Android phones are built is a bit different: a phone maker designs and builds a phone. They then install Android on it, usually after ruining it with a custom skin. After a bit of tinkering and testing, the phone gets shipped out to consumers. This is the way ALL Android handsets are made. And this is why they are often problematic – see Samsung’s recent Galaxy Note 7 episode. The Pixel phones are different, though, because they feel as if they have been designed AROUND Android. Android is the star of the show here. Not an EDGE display, nor an odd chassis, or a missing headphone jack. No. These phones are ALL about Android. Period. I could go on about how good the Pixel XL is to use in a day-to-day setting, but by now you probably get the picture. This phone is stunning in the performance department and it is unlike anything else that came before it. I think this is why Google changed the name. It did it because Nexus was not good enough for this phone. It deserved something new and fresh and unique for the phone space because that’s what this phone is all about: a new direction for Google and Android. --------------------------------------------------------- Two Month Update: Problems With My Pixel XL Google’s Pixel XL is one of the best Android phones you can buy right now. The Pixel XL isn’t the most exciting handset to look at but the specs, performance and software are great. Ditto imaging. So all is forgiven in the looks department. The Pixel XL is Google’s iPhone, basically. It is Google taking a more nuanced and focussed approach to hardware inside the Android space. We had Nexus phones before, sure, but the Pixel phones are different; and not just in terms of how much they cost. The Pixel phones are the truest embodiment of what Android should look and feel like on a phone. And for the most part, Google smashed the ball outta the park – both Pixel phones are exceptional performers in every regard. But there is a problem with my Pixel XL. It likes to pass out sometimes. You can’t predict when it will happen, but like an heavy-drinker it is usually at night – after 10pm. This crashing issue has been noted by other users, I've read reports about it in the past, but figured my handset must have not been affected. I was wrong. My handset is affected, so whatever this bug is it can, presumably, hit a Pixel phone at any time, as mine was fine and then all of a sudden it wasn’t. What happens is a two fold process: the screen freezes, then the phone restarts. It’s annoying as hell, as 1) it’s unpredictable and 2) it takes about 2 minutes for the phone to then reboot. I’ve tried factory resetting the handset and this hasn't fixed the issue which makes me think it is either a full-on hardware defect or something that Google can fix with a software update. Either way, I’m hoping it gets fixed soon as it is starting to get rather annoying. --------------------------------------------------------- Google Pixel XL Review: Camera UPDATE: Google WILL Fix Halo-Flare Bug With Software Update Google has confirmed there is an issue with the Pixel’s camera and will soon issue a software fix to remedy it. A lot of Pixel users have noticed a weird, halo-like effect that appears on some images. The bug apparently affects all Pixel handsets – whether you’ve experienced it or not – but it is now in the process of being eliminated by a software patch that will appear shortly. “In a post from the Pixel User Community,” notes Phandroid, “a Googler flat out confirms that the Pixel “has a little too much of the ‘halo/arc’ flare” but they’re already working on a fix. No, there’s not going to be a global recall (heh). Instead, Google says a future software update — arriving in the next few weeks — will help alleviate the appearance of the halo/light arc in photos. Using new algorithms to identify the halo, Google believes they’ll be able to eliminate it from photos, almost like a quick PhotoShop job being done on the fly.” As of December 1, although the above issue has been fixed, a new camera-related bug is apparently afflicting many Pixel and Pixel XL users. Specifically, this bug is related to the camera application itself. A post on the Google Pixel user community outlines the problem, apparently the application freezes  with "pink/purple vertical lines very regularly although not all the time." The users have tried clearing the application cache and data, and to perform factory resets on the phone, but this has not fixed the issue - even running the phone in safe mode doesn't help. The number of users experiencing this problem and posting in the thread has increased, and some have discovered the issue appears to be tied to poor signal reception areas; having aeroplane mode switched on also seems to keep the problem at bay, oddly. A post made in the thread by a Google official confirms that the company is investigating the issue. ---------------------------------------------- Forget what Apple says, the best camera on the market RIGHT NOW is inside the Google Pixel XL. I’ve been snapping images with it for just over a week and I have to say, once again, it is unlike anything I have used before. It doesn’t matter where you’re shooting, or in what type of light, the Pixel XL will deliver solid, good-looking, detailed images. I suck at photography, big time, so if the Pixel XL can make my photographs look good then someone more capable should be churning out works of art with this thing. So what makes the camera so good? Three core aspects, in my opinion: 1) a simple application, 2) the speed with which it loads up and snaps pictures and 3) insanely fast focus. Couple this with an excellent 12.3MP sensor, large 1.55μm pixels and an f/2.0 aperture and you have a camera setup that is currently unparalleled in the mobile space. The Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 Plus have excellent cameras, but neither are as good as the shooter inside the Pixel XL. Alongside the software inside the Pixel XL, this is one of the phone’s biggest USPs. Interestingly, it’s one I wasn’t expecting. I know Google said the Pixel XL has the best camera ever at launch, but I figured that was just locker-room talk – not an actual statement of fact! It’s much the same with video as well. You can shoot in 4K and the results look amazing when played back on a compatible device. And if all this wasn’t good enough, Google is giving ALL Pixel users unlimited storage for all their pictures and videos – even 4K ones – so you’ll never run out of space on your phone ever again. The Google Pixel’s imaging prowess is well documented. The 12.3MP camera is very impressive. Even by Apple and Samsung standards, however, new details have surfaced about how this camera technology was developed. The software for the lens actually comes from Google’s Alphabet Division and was born when Google was working on Google Glass. Known as Gcam, the technology was designed to improve mobile photography using techniques from computational photography. The technology was originally created in 2011 when the team were attempting to create a sensor that could be implemented inside Glass but provide performance on par with mobile phone cameras. “Design constraints of the wearable meant that the physical sensor would have to be relatively small with reduced low-light and dynamic range performance in addition to already limited compute and battery power,” notes 9to5Google. In order to make it work, Google engineers developed a method called image fusion that “takes a rapid sequence of shots and then fuses them to create a single, higher quality image”. This technology first appeared inside Glass, then the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 and then, once HDR+ had been added, inside Google’s Pixel phones. Google Pixel XL Review: Android. Android. Android! I’ve been saying this for years, but it still stands: if you LOVE Android, use a Nexus phone - and this applies just as much to the Pixel phones too. Why? Simple: Pixel phones run the purest form of Android, with zero bloatware, designed and functioning just as Google intended. If you value things like this, as I do, then there really is no competition in this regard. You get Android updates first, while other, more costly Android phones have to wait months. There is no bloatware inside; just Google apps and the one’s you choose to install. You get immediate access to all the latest security patches and fixes and, generally speaking, everything runs a lot smoother as a result. The Pixel Phones also feature a bunch of unique software attributes that you CANNOT get anywhere else. These are as follows: Google Assistant Unlimited Storage For Photos and Video (even 4K video)  The Pixel Launcher Smart Storage  24/7 Support  Pixel Camera I have never understood why people who like Android get anything other than a Nexus phone. They get updates first, were always solid and most of the time were cheaper than handsets from HTC, LG and Samsung. This latter point no longer stands, as the Pixel phones are rather pricy, however, the former points still do – and they’re now even better as a lot of what makes the Pixel tick is exclusive to the Pixel. The Pixel Launcher is Google’s new stock Android look. It’s smart, tidy and packed with useful features. Assistant is always accessible by voice or a long hold on the home button. You can also swipe right to access Assistant. The app tray is gone, sort of… now you simply swipe up from the bottom of the display to access your applications. The wallpapers Google has included are STUNNING. They have this awesome slow-zoom effect when you unlock the phone, which is so subtle you might not notice it. Android has never looked better in my opinion. It has also never been smarter, thanks to Google Assistant which is now leagues ahead of Siri in every regard. Update: Google Update Fixes Google Pixel XL Headaches Google has reportedly fixed a major bug that has been plaguing the Google Pixel handsets and causing speaker distortion at higher volume levels. Google previously acknowledged the issue after multiple users reported it and said it was working on a fix, however, a report revealed comments from a support agent who claimed it was a hardware problem on a specific batch of handsets. With the arrival of the February security patch, although the bugfix isn't mentioned in the release notes, it appears it may have in fact been a software issue which Google may have silently fixed. A Reddit thread for Pixel users has filled up with reports that users are no longer encountering the issue after the security update. However, some users are still encountering the problem. Potentially it could be a limited run soak test of the fix which Google will rollout to other devices in the future. Update: Android 7.1 Preview Pushed OTA In Canada - Reveals New Feature We're not sure whether someone pressed the wrong button, but some users in Canada are reporting having recevied an OTA update which pushes a Preview build of Android 7.1 to the Google Pixel phones. The new build, labelled “Security Update + Bug Fixes,” is a 261MB Android 7.1 file with the build number NPF26J. The "P" stands for Preview, and ordinarily such builds would not be published OTA in this manner. Regardless, users are reporting a new feature lands with the update which isn't mentioned in the changelogs; a couple of new gesture options are added to the "Move" menu which allow the user to activate some Always-On display-like features to check notifications by either tapping the display or lifting the phone up. 9To5Google reports that users claim the features work well, with no bugs or issues encountered so far. On December 5 Google has now made Android 7.1.1 available to Google Pixel handsets, both as an over-the-air (OTA) download and as downloadable factory image files which you can load onto the device manually. The files are available for; Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P (all carriers but Verizon), Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Nexus 9 LTE, and the Nexus Player. The update brings some of the Pixel features to non-Pixel phones, though not all; some stuff is being kept as Pixel exclusive content. As well as this, the download includes the latest Android security patches. As of December 12, Google has released a small, additional update patch for the Pixel and Pixel XL units designated NMF26Q, specifically for UK O2 network handsets. The update doesn't change the build number, but simply adds in some fixes that were left out of the main 7.1.1 update for reasons unknown at this time. The changelog simply reads: "remove spaces in front of APN types so that telephony can find APNs that can handle a particular type properly". It's believed the fix relates to MMS media messages. It's also expected that this update may see a wider release soon, as similar connection issues have been noted outside of the UK as well. Google Pixel XL Review: Battery Battery performance isn’t the most glitzy subject to talk about, but it is something 100% of mobile users value. No one phone has yet taken battery performance to a level comparable to what we had back in the days of the Nokia 3310. The Pixel XL doesn’t remedy this situation either, but what it does it still very impressive by today’s standards. Whatever you do with this phone it just flat out REFUSES to consume juice. During testing I pushed this phone as hard as I could. I went away on a trip for 24 hours, didn’t take a charger and used the phone normally, assuming it would die in the wee hours of the morning, but, lo and behold, the Pixel XL was still alive and kicking with 20% left in the tank when I returned home the following day. I sometimes forget to charge it and it will EASILY last until about 2pm. Nothing hurts this phone. I have no idea how Google has done this but it is DAMN impressive. The only phone that is remotely comparable is the Huawei Mate 8… but even that phone pales in comparison to what the Pixel XL is capable of with respect to battery conservation. If you don’t use the Pixel XL, it simply doesn’t use battery life, a first for Android phones in my experience. Push it hard – like, REALLY hard – and it will last a full day and a half. This is the only phone I have ever used that I can feel confident about taking it out after work, without a top-up, and not worry about it dying on me when I need it most, usually around 2am, after a skin-full and in dire need of an Uber. The Pixel XL’s battery performance is utterly bonkers. There’s just no other word to describe it. Google Pixel XL Review: Verdict There are so many Android handsets to choose from with very little, in terms of specs and hardware, to actually separate them. A lot of people are loyal to brands – Apple and Samsung – while others prefer to go for value; value like the OnePlus 3 or BlackBerry DTEK50, for instance. The Pixel phones kind of sit outside of both these categories, as the brand and name itself, at least in the mobile space, is completely untested. This is why Google is spending so much coin on promoting the Pixel phones, both here and in the US. It wants you to buy into the brand of Pixel; it wants you to view these handsets as its iPhone. And this is a tough sell. Apple didn’t become Apple overnight and Samsung has spent BILLIONS promoting its brand to consumers, meaning Google has quite a bit of catching-up to do. But once you use this phone, it kind of sells itself. There is a lot of hatred for this brand of phone; people say it’s too expensive, that it’s dull looking. But for some Android purists – people like me – that doesn’t matter. I’ve been waiting for Google to do a phone like this since the Nexus One, a phone that gets updates first, a phone that has best-in-class specs, and a phone, importantly, with excellent battery life. Obviously I’d prefer it if this handset was cheaper. I think Google could have taken a hit on the chin and lowered its margin for the phone, but it hasn’t and that’s just something you’ll have to deal with. No one’s forcing you to buy this phone, after all. Apple has never compromised on price. Ever. Even when it’s iPhones were out-specced and out-designed, the company still retailed them as high as it possibly could. This is what Google’s doing and while you might not like it, the company clearly has an eye on what it wants to achieve with this handset; it wants to create an Android version of the iPhone. It wants to make the perfect Android phone and while this handset isn’t perfect – the design, the price, etc – it’s better than nearly every other Android phone I have tested in the past 18 months with respect to performance, imaging and battery life. If you love Android, buy this phone. If you want market-leading battery performance and a brilliant camera, buy this phone. Nothing else compares. I used to be a Nexus purist. Not anymore. Now I am a Pixel purist. Nexus is dead… Long live the KING! Google Pixel XL Review: Where To Buy One?  Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past week, you will have seen Google’s rather EPIC Pixel advertising campaign in full swing. The adverts are, quite literally, everywhere your eyeballs dare to wonder. The ads are well produced and they look good but they are a bit confusing, as a lot of them emphasise the “Exclusive on Verizon” angle, which is only half true – you can also get the phones direct from Google. Still, if you’re a longstanding Verizon user then you might want to check out some of the deals the network is offering on the Pixel and Pixel XL. I just had a quick gander and some of them look pretty tasty.  If you're in the UK and are looking for a BADASS contract for either of Google's excellent Pixel phones, then you NEED to check out Carphone Warehouse's current batch – they're some of the best we've seen to date.  And if you want more details on buying options for the Pixel and Pixel XL be sure to check out our Pixel and Pixel XL Buying Guide  Read More About: Mobile Phones Google Google Pixel XL Android Nougat Sponsored Links Related content Best Places To Pre-Order Samsung Galaxy S8 & Galaxy S8 Plus Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date & Specs Rumours It's Almost TIME For The Nokia 8: Release Date & Specs News iPhone 8 or "iPhone Pro" – New Theory Suggests Name Change Xiaomi Mi 6 & Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus Specs LEAK View the discussion thread.

Non-profit chaired by Eric Schmidt ranks Google above Apple in privacy, governance & freedom of expression Ben Lovejoy - Mar. 27th 2017 6:06 am PT @benlovejoy AAPL Company Google Privacy View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The 2017 Corporate Accountability Index – a company ranking put together by a non-profit chaired by Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt – has ranked Google top dog in the technology sector, while Apple sits at #7 with a little over half Google’s score. Anker braided Lightning cables Apple ranked seventh among the 12 internet and mobile companies evaluated, with an overall score of only 35 percent, despite the company’s strong public stand for users’ privacy rights in the face of recent U.S. government demands. A major reason for Apple’s relatively low score was lack of disclosure about commitments and policies affecting freedom of expression. Also, next to its U.S. peers, Apple disclosed little about how or whether it has institutionalized commitments to protect users’ rights. Google got the top score of 65 in the table put together by Ranking Digital Rights, a program from New America, whose chairman emeritus is executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet. The connection between New America and Ranking Digital Rights is not made terribly obvious on the website of either, but is acknowledged by a link on the Funders and Partners page of the latter’s site. The Register first spotted the link when Google came in on top the first year the ranking was announced, in 2015. Schmidt became executive chairman of the New America Foundation, which had built a strong reputation as a non-partisan and imaginative policy think tank, in 2008. The following year, the foundation created an “Open Technology Initiative” and the think tank began to march in lockstep with Google’s own policy agenda. This is called “policy laundering” – the act of legitimising a policy, or attempting to seize control of a debate, via third parties. Another useful description is “carousel propaganda”, coined by blogger Frank Fisher, an analogue of “carousel fraud”. The Register also noted the absurd methodology used to rank companies. The RDR project did not empirically measure the behaviour of the companies. It merely performed a textual analysis of their mission statements, click-through policies, and public utterances. It examined what they say they do, not what they actually do. But then it didn’t measure it against reality. “We did not fact check their statements,” project head Rebecca McKinnon admitted this week in a video webcast. “What we’re hoping is this create a set of data based on what companies claim they’re doing.” So it just looks for keywords in documents – keywords that someone involved with the organization might know to use – and then doesn’t even check whether the company lives up to its claims.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google working on a new social photo editing app By Rei Padla - March 27, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is working on something new that people might say is just another social app. The company rolled out the Duo and Allo after almost a year since they were introduced at the Google I/O 2016. Now that a new conference is about to open, we know Google may try again and see if a new social media network will finally make it big. You see, the search giant isn’t exactly successful in this this area as it needs to compete with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. There is still hope for Google in this area. This new app in the works is said to be ideal for a small group of people who want to edit photos together. In the said app, they can organize the photos according to their preferences. It’s something like a combination of Path and Snapchat if we are too look at the filters and some imaging features. Google has confirmed this app without giving any further details. We were told that it’s only an experiment. It’s only one of the many apps they are working on. We’re guessing this one will be unveiled at the conference in May and then released later in the year or early in 2018. The idea is that the app will be known as a collaborative social photo app. Anyone is encouraged to share photos in groups and then any member can edit or tag them. Google may also incorporate Google Photos and image search depending on the needs and wants of the users.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Hangouts is Killing Text Message Support, as It Wants to be the Complete Slack Rival March 27, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Long-Forgotten Tweetdeck Might Soon Get a Paid Upgrade Facebook Testing New Bubble-Styled Interface for Comments Google has already done the spadework for transforming the Hangouts app into a Slack-alike platform. Now it just has to do the simple tweaks to get the work done, which it has began by dropping the support for text messaging in Hangouts. Google has now revealed that the support for text messaging in Hangouts will no longer be available from May 22 through an email sent to the G Suite developers. Accordingly, users will be prompted to switch to an alternate app to continue using their SMS services. The warning message will start popping up as early as March 27th in the Hangouts app. Users will be forced to select another installed app for SMS, and in case if they are missing one, they will be guided to Play Store to get one. The move is not a surprise as Google has earlier hinted its overhaul works by revamping the Google Messenger app as Android Messages, which post May 22 will be the primary SMS communication tool from Google. The move has been incorporated to transform Hangouts app as a workspace communication tool similar to Slack. While dropping text message support sounds disappointing, it shouldn’t be a massive upset as Google already offers a host of communication tools including one for SMS. The killing of text message support will also be carried over to Google Voice, through which users won’t be able to send or receive carrier SMS post May 22. However, they will still be able to continue sending SMS using their Google Voice number.

With it, you can quickly add events to your Google Calendar either by its main interface or by using the “Control+G” hotkey to add the selected text as an event on Google Calendar. It is pretty similar to the way you add events in Google Calendar web interface but the added advantage is that you don’t have to open your web browser for this simple task again and again. Just press the hotkey to bring forth its minimal interface and then specify the event details in the description like “Lunch tomorrow at 2:00 P.M.” and it will then add the event to the appropriate date on Google Calendar. It also provides you a quick link to edit the added event straight on the Google Calendar interface. Another useful feature is that it can also fetch all calendars from your account and you can select a particular calendar while adding an event with this freeware. Sponsored Links In the GIF above you can see how quickly you can add events to your Google Calendar, select text and then with just a press of a hotkey a new Google Calendar event will be generated. So, you don’t have to open your web browser to add events, just use this freeware to do it in a flash. Meanwhile, you can check out these Google Calendar desktop clients and use them to access Google Calendar from your PC. How to use this free software to quickly add events to Google Calendar on Windows: Getting started with this Google Calendar client is pretty simple, just download it from the link at the end of this review and then execute its EXE file. After that, you will see the minimal interface of the Google QuickCal Add as shown in the screenshot below. Now, the first thing you have to do is connect your Google Calendar account with this quick event add utility. Click on the Refresh button to allow it to access your Google Calendar account to add events. Do note that it doesn’t store any of your passwords as it uses Google OAuth authentication. Now, you can start adding events to your Google Calendar using 2 simple methods as explained below: Method 1: As I mentioned, it can fetch all calendars from your Google Calendar account, and you can select the required calendar from the drop-down list as shown in the screenshot above. If it doesn’t appear in the drop-down list, then click on the “Refresh” button to fetch all calendars list. After selecting a Google Calendar on which you want to add the event, specify the event details in the “Desc:” field as you do in Google Calendar. Now, click on the QuickAdd button. This will add a Google Calendar event to the appropriate date as specified in the “Desc:” field. It also shows a notification which shows the calendar entry with a quick link to edit it on the Google Calendar web interface. The Google Calendar entry exactly looks like as shown in the screenshot below. Method 2: The second method is far too easy as you have to just select a text from anywhere on Windows and then hit the “Control+G” hotkey to add a Google Calendar event. As in the previous method, in this method, you will be shown a Google Calendar entry details with a quick link. Verdict: I will recommend Google QuickCal Add as it is very lightweight, portable, and most importantly allows you to quickly add Google Calendar events.

Today, we’ve matched the G6 up against the Pixel to see if it can bring down the best smartphone camera of 2016. As a reminder, the G6 has dual-13 megapixel sensors with the main sensor paired with a 71-degree f/1.8 lens, optical image stabilization and phase detection autofocus. Google’s Pixel has a 12.3 MP sensor, f/2.0 lens, electronic image stabilization and  phase detection & laser autofocus. Despite having a lower resolution sensor and a lens which lets in less light, the Pixel does have Google’s HDR+ feature which uses information from multiple images to create a single shot. Take a look at the gallery below and let us know if the LG G6 produces better shots than the Google Pixel.  If you need a closer look at the images, check out the gallery below or download the full resolution images.

Na quarta-feira, a companhia de telecomunicações AT&T e a Johnson & Johnson, entre outras empresas, comunicaram que deixarão de veicular vídeos promocionais no YouTube e em outras plataformas do Google, por considerarem que a gigante de tecnologia não tem tomado medidas suficientes para impedir a exibição de conteúdo que incita o terrorismo ao lado de propagandas. A iniciativa das empresas, que não alcança a ferramenta de busca do Google, segue o exemplo das adotadas na Europa, onde o governo britânico, a farmacêutica GSK, o jornal The Guardian e a multinacional francesa de publicidade Havas também já retiraram suas propagandas. A decisão das companhias foi tomada após o jornal The Times publicar uma reportagem que mostra que propagandas apareceram próximas a materiais extremistas e de conteúdo ofensivo no YouTube e em sites vinculados ao Google. Em nota, a Johnson & Johnson informou levar o “assunto muito a sério” e que continuará tomando medidas para garantir que suas propagandas sejam coerentes com seus valores. A AT&T comunicou estar “profundamente preocupada” com o fato de sua publicidade ter aparecido ao lado de conteúdo que promovia terrorismo e ódio. “Removeremos nossos anúncios das plataformas que não são de busca do Google até que a empresa possa garantir que isso não aconteça novamente”, diz uma nota da AT&T. A companhia de telecomunicações foi uma das cinco maiores anunciantes dos Estados Unidos no ano passado, gastando quase US $ 1 bilhão até novembro, segundo a Kantar Media. Debate O anúncio de que as marcas estão rompendo com o Google reavivou o debate sobre os riscos que as empresas enfrentam com publicidade programática (compra e venda, através de ferramentas eletrônicas, de espaço para propaganda digital). O fato de companhias como o Google e o Facebook lidarem com um grande número de sites torna difícil o controle de conteúdo de todos eles. Além disso, as páginas onde são inseridas os anúncios são determinadas por algoritmos, o que faz o trabalho de verificação ser mais árduo. As políticas do Google proíbem anúncios em vídeos considerados pornográficos ou que promovem comportamentos ilegais. A empresa também usa um software que indica conteúdo potencialmente impróprio, mas as denúncias da semana passada mostram que o sistema ainda apresenta falhas. O Google é hoje o maior vendedor de espaço para publicidade na internet. O segmento de propaganda da companhia gerou US$ 22,4 bilhões no último trimestre de 2016. A maior parte desse montante ainda é de anúncios que aparecem em pesquisas na internet, mas executivos da empresa já afirmaram estar animados com o potencial do YouTube e da mídia programática.

Two other flagships, equally worthy of attention, are expected launch later in the year — Samsung’s foldable device, the Samsung Galaxy X, and Google’s Pixel successor, the Pixel 2. While Google confirmed March 3 that a Pixel 2 device is in the works, the existence of a Samsung Galaxy X is largely supported by rumors and Samsung’s recent patents. Both phones are expected to be premium devices with high-end features. Read: iPhone X vs. Samsung Galaxy X Let’s compare both and find out how they match up against each other. Display Both the Samsung Galaxy X and the Google Pixel 2 are expected to have different displays than their predecessors. The Pixel 2 is expected to have an edge-to-edge display which will provide the users with more screen area than what’s present on current devices. The Samsung Galaxy X is expected to have a foldable display mechanism — an inward folding display with two screens on opposite sides and a mechanical hinge with a screen in the middle. When spread out straight, it would have a tablet-like form factor. Processor Both devices could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835. The current stock of the processor is reserved to cater to Samsung Galaxy S8 production, but since both the devices are expected to launch later in the year, both could possibly have the 10nm technology-based processor. Camera While no information is available about the camera on Google X, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to build on the success of its predecessor. The company is currently developing a camera technology for improving low-light performance of cameras, according to 9to5 Google. AI-Voice Assistants Both devices are expected to come with artificial intelligence based voice assistants. While the Samsung Galaxy X is expected to come with Bixby, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to come with an improved version of the Google Assistant. OS While the Samsung Galaxy X is expected to come with Android Nougat OS, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be the first smartphone to come with the next iteration of Android – Android O. Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 vs. Google Pixel 2 Both smartphones are expected to be IP68 standard waterproof. While the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be priced at $649, the same as the Google Pixel, the Samsung Galaxy X is expected to be priced upward of $1,000.

Sidin Vadukut Learn to tailor work with the constraints. Photo: iStockphoto This week’s meditation on the untangled life is in two parts. The first has to do with hardware and the second with software, which is an elegant arrangement, don’t you think? Late last year, my daughter, and I love her very much indeed, dropped a glass of water on my laptop, a five-year old Apple MacBook Air. RIP. So with a heavy heart, but a light wallet, I decided to purchase a new machine. And mostly out of budget constraints, but partly out of curiosity, I purchased a cheap and cheerful Acer Chromebook R 11 with 4 GB RAM and a touchscreen. This is not a review of the machine. But I really do like it very much. It is light and sturdy and has excellent battery life. It excels at working within the Google ecosystem. But most of all, it has an extremely limited collection of apps and extensions. Wait. Did I just say that I like it for its limited app ecosystem?! Yes. Let me explain. When you use an operating system like Windows or macOS you have a universe of useful applications to choose from that can achieve every conceivable task. Thus many people often end up downloading very specific apps to do very specific things. Which is great. But eventually, especially if you are undisciplined, like I am, you end up with tons of apps that you rarely use but are loath to uninstall. This usually clogs up the hard drive on your machine and weighs your operating system down with detritus. The Chromebook is far more constrained (for now. Soon all new Chromebooks will run Android apps, which is still constraining in some sense). The only apps and extensions you can install on your Chromebook are those that work off the browser. Essentially, everything you do on a Chromebook happens within the constraints of a browser window. Install a Slack or a Google Hangouts app and what you get are the browser versions of those apps running inside specific windows. Then there are browser extensions which can get a fair amount done while you are on the Web, such as bookmark sites (Pocket), cite papers (Paperpile), or relay mobile notifications (Pushbullet). Overindulge, however, and you end up ruining your browser experience. And all these constraints are a good thing? Yes. Because you learn to tailor your laptop-usage behaviour to make maximum use of these constraints. Much like many other aspects of creative life, these constraints can make you both more efficient and more creative. This has been my experience. I’ve now developed an on-the-go working style in which I’ve learnt to make the most of Google Docs and a short set of other apps and extensions such as Google Hangouts for communication, Pocket Casts for podcast listening, Paperpile for citations, Kindle Cloud Reader and, most of all, WorkFlowy. I am amazed that I hadn’t heard of WorkFlowy until I purchased the Chromebook. WorkFlowy is, to put it simply, an app for writing and maintaining bulleted lists. I know exactly what you’re thinking right now: Aren’t there a million list-making apps? And can’t you just make lists in Google Docs or Evernote or whatever? Yes, yes and yes. But WorkFlowy is brilliant in a few ways. First, it is fast, simple, and syncs brilliantly with the WorkFlowy Android app on my phone. Second, it will take you no more than 15 minutes to figure out how it works. It has no bloat. Third, there is a great online community of users and WorkFlowy buffs who have great ideas and templates that you may find useful. (I recently found a great template to outline and write book-length manuscripts). But what I love most about WorkFlowy, and why it has become central to my day-to-day life, are the collapsing and zooming functions. Everything in WorkFlowy exists as an entry on a list. So your highest-level lists could be: Work, Home, Things To Do, Shopping List. You have sublists (Book Manuscript), and then further lists (Character Outlines) nesting within each of them, and so on. How much you want to see on the screen is up to you. You can collapse or expand as you wish. Zooming brings added focus. Suppose you want to outline the Butler character in your crime novel. You can zoom right into the Butler Outline bullet point in your WorkFlowy app, and everything on the screen will go away. What is left is a clean, pure environment ready for taking copious notes. Without your mind being distracted by the shopping list or the “Books To Buy” list lurking in the periphery. Done with work? Zoom right out again and tackle something else. It all sounds simple indeed. And it is. This is why it works on a Chromebook. But WorkFlowy has been a great addition to my workflow. Full functionality requires a paid account, but I highly recommend giving the demo a shot. I have hundreds of entries in dozens of lists that all exist safely tucked away inside an entirely manageable list of half-a-dozen top-level superlists. Constraints are not all that bad. They often give rise to some great ideas. Sidin Vadukut Topics: Constraints Windows macOS Chromebook.

(Reuters/Paul Hanna) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong March 27, 2017 Google’s hate-speech headaches won’t go away. The search giant has already apologized twice to advertisers for placing their ads on YouTube channels that promote terrorism and other hate speech, but big brands in the US are still pulling their campaigns from the platform, and media agencies are asking for discounts. The brands’ anger is hurting Google’s reputation among its most important clients. For all of Google’s world-changing ambitions, it continues to make nearly all of its money from advertising. The hate-speech revelations awkwardly expose the usually cloistered relationship between the tech firm and the brands and media agencies that keep it in business. The share price of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has fallen by 4% over the past week, erasing some $36 billion in market value. Google’s problems began in the UK, when the Times of London published an investigation last month (paywall) showing that ads from major brands were appearing next to hundreds of YouTube videos containing hate speech. The revelations gathered momentum, leading to a parliamentary grilling. Uncomfortable, but nothing the tech giant couldn’t handle, it seemed. Then, things took an unexpected turn. Global media agency Havas pulled its UK advertising with Google on March 17, taking ads from brands like Audi and O2 off the platform. Other brands quickly followed, including L’Oreal and McDonald’s. In less than a week, some 250 brands had withdrawn UK ads from Google. Google issued an apology on March 21, following a verbal one by its European head at a trade conference in London, and promised to fix things swiftly. It was to no avail. The same day, the scandal crossed the Atlantic, with Johnson & Johnson and AT&T pulling their ads globally (paywall). Days later, more major brands followed suit, including General Motors and PepsiCo. The pressure continues to mount. The UK’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, described Google’s inability to police the content on its platforms as “disgusting” in an interview yesterday. There is one clear-cut way for Google to make amends. The media agencies charged with managing ad spending on Google’s platforms are now publicly demanding discounts to make up for the hate-speech placements in the past. Here’s how the logic goes, as Rob Norman, chief digital officer at agency Group M, told the Financial Times (paywall): To avoid appearing alongside hate speech, brands want to target their ads more narrowly, which usually costs more. Since Google shouldn’t allow hate-speech on its platforms in the first place, it should give the media agencies a discount for highly targeted ads. Advertising mogul Martin Sorrell, who heads WPP, the world’s largest ad agency, personally dressed down Google’s top UK executive at a conference the two appeared at together earlier this month. “You have resources, your margins are enormous, you don’t explain to people how algorithms work,” he said. “You have to change in my view.” The message from agencies is clear—more apologies won’t bring back Google’s advertisers, but discounts might.

Twitter Facebook Follow us: Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media Tools Advertise 4 Google Sheets Add-Ons Every SEO Should Have SEO March 27, 2017 SEO Clark BoydMarch 27, 2017 486SHARES 1.3KREADS 486SHARES 1.3KREADS Clark Boyd 486SHARES 1.3KREADS ADVERTISEMENT For many in the SEO industry, the migration from Microsoft Excel to Google Sheets has been sluggish. Folks seem to prefer Microsoft’s offering when it comes to undertaking large-scale analysis, but that has started to change of late. Google Sheets has always had some powerful selling points, namely its potential for cloud-based collaboration and handy functions like =importxml(). However, that has often not been sufficient for SEOs accustomed to the more sophisticated and reliable functions Excel can offer. Sheets does have something extra to offer: its extensive library of add-ons. Some of these simply add functions that any Excel aficionado would take for granted, but others go further than that, perhaps giving Google’s spreadsheet platform an edge in this ongoing battle. Downloading just a handful of these add-ons can automate quotidian SEO tasks, providing fresh insight and simply making us better at what we do. To get started, just click on ‘Add-ons’ in the top navigation: From here, a vast array of options is instantly available. Below, I have selected just four of my personal favorites: Search Analytics for Sheets Getting accurate keyword-level data has been an increasingly uphill task for SEOs. We have become dependent on Search Analytics as a data source. However, there are still some significant shortcomings with this platform. Leaving aside the unchangeable aspects of this, such as the two-day lag (if we’re lucky) in data and the normalized search volumes, the user interface also does us few favors. That’s where Search Analytics for Sheets comes in. This add-on fulfills an essential function by using the Search Analytics API to pull your information into Sheets and providing a slew of new ways to slice the data. Some common questions we go to Search Analytics to answer, at times with difficulty due to its limited functionality, include: How often does my site rank for a particular query across multiple URLs? Google has expanded its paid advertising footprint. How has this affected my SEO CTR by device, location, and keyword? How is seasonality affecting my website’s performance? (The 90-day limit on Search Analytics data is a real restriction on this kind of analysis.) By using the right sidebar options to call for your data by Query and Page, for example, the information will be pulled into Sheets directly, as in the example below: This creates new opportunities to filter query-level performance by URL, and there are options to add extra groups to the spreadsheet such as Country or Device. Moreover, you can also schedule automated downloads of your data, so you’ll never need to worry about that 90-day historical limit again. Supermetrics Supermetrics is a very useful tool for pulling data from a wide variety of different connectors into Sheets. Their website highlights just how many of these are now available: The pro version does come with an attached cost of $49/month, so this doesn’t quite rank alongside the great selection of free add-ons available for Sheets. However, Supermetrics does provide two essential capabilities. First of all, it creates an easy way to synthesize a number of data sources within one spreadsheet, which in turn allows for further data manipulation and analysis. However, the role that Supermetrics has increasingly come to play in my daily activities is as an intermediary between platforms like Facebook and integrated reporting solutions like Google’s Data Studio. With Data Studio now free to use worldwide, it is a powerful tool for everyday reporting and analysis. That said, it does lack integration with some important connectors, such as Facebook Ads. By using Supermetrics, we can pull Facebook data into Sheets and then sync that spreadsheet with our Data Studio report. The valuable solutions that it brings make Supermetrics a very helpful add-on for any SEO that wants to assess their data in the context of the wider digital marketing picture. Google Analytics for Sheets The Google Analytics add-on is notable primarily for its ability to create and schedule custom reports within Sheets. Once the add-on is installed, the following options will be readily available within a user’s Sheets account: By going to the right sidebar and setting the View and Start/End dates, along with the requested Dimensions and Metrics, data will be pulled from the selected Analytics account. It does take a certain level of technical fluency to master its use of Regular Expressions, but users familiar with the data segmentation used within Google Analytics should have no issues compiling reports, allowing for some trial and error. Google has produced a short but comprehensive video that will guide users through building their first report if any hurdles are encountered along the way. Although the interface may not be the most intuitive, this add-on provides a further level of flexibility to Analytics data and will save a lot of time normally spent isolating data points, once the reports are set up and scheduled. If that wasn’t enough, you can also combine this add-on with Search Analytics for Sheets to start uncovering keyword-level data in a lot more detail. This guide over on Moz gives a great overview of how to get started. Text Analysis Text Analysis is a fantastic add-on for expediting the keyword research process, and it can also help with content idea generation. The tool works by taking as its stimulus a selected topic, hashtag, or Twitter handle. It is then capable of pulling in and analyzing all related links, documents, and Tweets. This is powered by the AYLIEN Text Analysis API, which uses natural language processing to assess sentiment within content, for example. It contains a range of handy functions, such as the option to summarize longer pieces of content and the ability to recognize frequently-used key phrases. As with all such technologies, its findings do need to be taken with a grain of salt sometimes (particularly the sentiment analysis), but as a starting point for wide-ranging topic research, it is still a go-to tool. It is worth noting, however, that this is a freemium add-on; users will have to purchase credits to analyze larger data sets. Honorable Mentions To insert some of the typical Excel functions within Sheets, it is also worth installing Power Tools, Remove Duplicates, and Advanced Find and Replace. Although not SEO-specific, these do all serve to streamline a number of data analysis tasks. All of these enhancements to Google Sheets, along with its in-built competitive advantage as a cloud-based solution and Data Studio integration, now make this platform a real contender when it comes to everyday SEO analysis.

The device is based heavily on the Google Assistant found on Android devices such as the Google Pixel. Since its introduction, a number of third-party developers have managed to make applications or actions for the device. Now, around 15 new ones have been added to the list and might include some nifty actions to help one with everyday housekeeping. According to Venture Beat, there are now 15 more new actions for the Google Home. This is in addition to the existing 140 that have been made so far. Out of this 15, a number of notable actions can help a certain household in keeping track of almost everything, including the grocery. One of the newest actions for Google Home includes keeping the grocery list. While this is already pretty useful on its own, it was then made even better. The action can now be linked to a mobile app called Chefling. This app, together with the digital assistant will let anyone know when a certain item in the fridge is about to expire. Quite handy especially for today’s busy professionals. Google Home (via madebygoogle.com) In addition to keeping track of one’s food, the Google Home also has actions for cleaning the house. Neato has introduced actions for the digital assistant that lets users control its range of robotic vacuum cleaners. Owners will be able to start, stop, and pause cleaning cycles with the new Google Home action. Other notable actions include the Red Pebble, which tells users the weather in Mars. There is also the Movie Maestro that gives IMDB ratings for movies. And the somewhat weird Jaden Smith quotes action that gives random quotes from the star himself. As mentioned, since its release, more than 140 third-party actions have been made for the Google Home. Google has been very open with developers and have been encouraging the latter to make new apps for the device. Surely, more will be released in the days to come. For more updates on the Google Home actions, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Starting from revamping the Play Store with new categories, to introducing a new photo editing app, Google is doing a lot more. The crucial of all the lot is the new 'Free App of the Week' section that Google has come up with for its Play Store. What is this 'Free App of the Week'? Well, Google is all geared up to add this new section on the Play Store. As the name suggests, the category will include a list of applications available for free for that particular day or for the week, so on and so forth. Basically, Google Play with this new 'Free App of the Week' will highlight the weekly or daily offers on popular applications.

The new 'Free App of the Week' section was first spotted by Android Police website. This is not the only thing Google is working on. A Twitter user with a username @YTSecurity spotted another crucial change on the Google Play Store. Google Play Store will now be divided into four new tabs, which includes - Updates, Installed, Library, and Beta. Not only that, Android users will also be able to manage apps in the Installed and Library tabs in alphabetical order, last updated, last used, and also based on the app size. Apart from revamping the Google Play Store, the tech giant is working on introducing a social photo app very soon. This app will apparently let the users share and edit pictures simultaneously. With the social media application, Google will allow the users to make use of image recognition, add filters to enhance their pictures, and even add tags. Google has confirmed the arrival of this 'unnamed' app to TechCrunch. The report by TechCrunch notes that this is not just "yet another messaging app" and is designed in a way to deliver a collaborative experience to users by helping them edit and share photos with friends individually or in group directly. No other details about the application have been revealed for now.

Here are tips to bolster your online presence with a well-thought-out campaign by Michael Weinhouse Sponsored By Logical Position Published 1 day ago With today’s online-first consumer marketplace, Realtors must be as savvy with technology and marketing as ever to rise above their competition. Especially with the influx of millennials entering the real estate market, creating and maintaining a captivating online presence is a must. Advertising through Google AdWords makes it possible for any agent to harness the undeniable power of online marketing, while staying cost-effective. The tool from Google allows you to select your desired audience and choose which search terms your ad will appear next to in the Google search results that relate to those keywords. Putting the power in the hands of the advertiser, AdWords gives Realtors creative and executional control. As a cherry on top, you only have to pay for your ad when the internet searcher clicks on it. For Realtors who are interested in opening a Google AdWords campaign, here are a few questions to consider from a user’s standpoint: Where will your ads take me? The last thing we want to see is for you to draw up a huge, elaborate Google AdWords campaign without thinking about what the internet searcher will land on. Before you put a campaign in motion, ensure your website is well-presented and well-written. If your site cannot easily handle all the leads pouring in it as a result of the advertising campaign, you’ve wasted your money. What do you want me to do? Make your call-to-action one of the first things the user sees when clicking through your ad. People online have notoriously short attention spans. Considering this, make sure they know what you want from them — their contact information, newsletter signup, or buying or listing a home with you. How can I work with you? Google AdWords allows you to easily list your business’ information and connect with the leads you’ve worked hard to garner. By having your address and contact information appear as part of your ad campaign, users will not have to frantically try to track you down and lose interest in the process. The most important thing for capturing a lead is making sure you are easy to get a hold of. Can you work in my area? The beauty of Google AdWords campaigns can be found within its customizability. Ads can be tweaked for variables like ZIP codes or specific neighborhoods so they can pertain to each unique user. Since real estate is such a community-based and location-specific industry, you can get extremely targeted with your advertising campaign to personally reach every lead. Realtors are now able to take control of their own digital marketing. In an online-first marketplace, this becomes increasingly important. Google AdWords gives you the power to customize your campaign to connect with the right leads for your business. Keep these considerations in mind before putting together a cohesive AdWords plan, and users who land on your site will appreciate the personal touch.

Ron Miller - Mar 27, 2017 11:30 am UTC Enlarge / Seth Erdman, center, and his fellow students use Chromebooks while working on a lesson in a third grade class on Friday, January 16, 2015, at Walden Elementary School in Deerfield, Illinois. (Anthony Souffle) Chicago Tribune / Contributor reader comments 46 Share this story When you think about a traditional school workflow, it's not unlike that of a business: paper is generated and moved in a systematic way between the children and the teacher. Just as cloud computing has transformed workflows in business to make them more collaborative and mobile, that same type of change has been coming to schools. Children and teachers use the power of the cloud to collaborate while accessing, storing, and sharing content. As with business, this change is ongoing, uneven, and by no means complete. But if schools are at least partly about preparing children for the next generation of work, then the cloud needs to be a part of that preparation. Just as some businesses have struggled to transition to the cloud, schools face similar challenges. But because schools involve a specific demographic—children from a variety of abilities and socioeconomic and linguistic backgrounds—their challenges can be even more complicated. Slowly but surely, in spite of the issues, cloud tools are coming to the classroom. As more companies, large and small, help schools bring about this transition in a way that makes sense for teachers and children in a classroom context, we are seeing a shift to the cloud and all the advantages (and problems) that brings. Peter Jordan is the CEO and co-founder at Knowledge Matters, a cloud service that delivers business simulations to over one-third of high schools in the US, covering subjects like management, retail, and personal finance. He says the company has been in business long enough to remember when delivering this type of content to classrooms was far more complex. "We think the cloud has already been transformational in delivering technology to the classroom," Jordan explained. "When we started Knowledge Matters, we were literally shipping CD-ROMs to schools across the country. From a technology standpoint, as an educational software company, it was a huge challenge, as we had to troubleshoot network configurations for teachers [and other installation issues]." Jonathan Rochelle, director of product management for Google Education, says that operational efficiency is just part of the cloud's advantage. "Teachers no longer have to take home a box of papers," he said. "They can provide feedback much faster, and they are spending more time with the students instead of [grading] papers." Clouds make more active students That shift in the teacher-student relationship goes even deeper, says Jason Klein, assistant superintendent for technology and learning at the Maine Township High School District in Chicago. He says using cloud tools has fundamentally changed the way teachers teach and children learn in his district's schools. Instead of a teacher being the information provider and the children being responsible for learning that information, the teacher becomes a facilitator or coach in helping children find the resources they need to learn. This arrangement makes children much more active participants in the learning process, he explained. In fact, each of the 6,500 kids in Klein's district has a Chromebook computer and access to Google tools like Google Drive and Google Docs. Rochelle says teachers manage the flow of content between them and students using Google Classroom, which gives teachers a central administrative interface to manage cloud activity in the classroom. That includes building a roster, communicating assignments to the whole class or individual students, and facilitating communication across the classroom. Klein says this capability enables teachers to review the documents children are working on in real time. Through the document-sharing capability, children can get feedback from peers as well as teachers. Too many choices? One of the great advantages about working in the cloud is the interoperability between services. If teachers want to use a module from Khan Academy, a language lesson in Duolingo, or a YouTube video from CrashCourse, they can incorporate all of that into their course work. This allows them to customize lessons for each child or group of children, taking into account a range of abilities. Yet trying to figure out which tools to use when accessing that world of content becomes a problem in itself. Klein's district provides a set of tools, but teachers are free to supplement those with whatever options they wish. In order to decide which tools are best from the universe of choices on the Internet, teachers communicate with one another, participate with other teachers on social networks to find what's working for them, and work with the school librarians, who are trained to find good sources and tools—and teach the teachers how to find them on their own. Sonny Hashmi, who is managing director of global governments at online content management company Box, says his company focuses on forming relationships with as many tool providers as possible. Box builds in integrations whenever it can, whether that's with Blackboard, Khan Academy, G Suite, or Office 365. "We believe in a world where solutions have to work together seamlessly," Hashmi said. While the cloud-computing trend favors the transition to more tools like these, obstacles remain. According to Rochelle of Google, "One of our biggest challenges is providing technology solutions that require bandwidth and some computer." This is especially true when kids go home after school. The Pew Center for Research has found that, while the Digital Divide is closing, it still persists for lower-income populations in the United States. And not every school can afford to issue digital tools to each student. Enlarge / Pew Research shows that broadband adoption among lower-income Americans has actually dropped, as more depend on smart phones for Internet. But smart phones may not be a good match for some cloud-based education tools. Esteban Sosnik is a partner at Reach Capital, who has invested in EdTech startups such as Nearpod, a content management and administrative tool aimed at classroom teachers, and Newsela, a reading platform that delivers leveled daily news content. He says one of the biggest challenges in bringing the cloud to the classroom is finding that central management tool that simplifies taking advantage of all the different options. "There is a bottleneck in terms of making it easy to deploy," Sosnik said. "Teachers don’t want to add more complexity into the classroom." He acknowledges Google Classroom is the closest to a central classroom administrative tool that we have. But he says that there is still no single default platform where teachers and children can start their daily digital journey (and there is a tremendous opportunity for a company to become that). Klein points out that, just as in business, this type of change requires top-down support and innovative thinking on the part of the entire school system. But it also requires practical systems in place to manage these tools and equipment, set up refresh cycles, and simply maintain the computers the children are using—whether that's a computer for every student or a cart system where classes share computers throughout the day. None of these impediments is insurmountable, but it takes a clear vision on the part of school systems to give teachers and students the tools they need to learn in the 21st century. "The implementation is getting better, and the cloud and connectivity are helping. We expect in three to five years' time, it will be [even] easier for teachers to use this technology in the classroom," Sosnik said. Ron Miller is a freelance technology journalist and blogger.

 Google is meeting the UK government this week to discuss tackling extremism Rob Price, Business Insider UK Mar. 27, 2017, 6:53 AM 597 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images LONDON — Google has confirmed it will be meeting the UK government this week, following a fatal terror attack in central London that has reignited heated debate over encryption, and as the company engine comes under fire over extremist material accessible through its search engine. On Sunday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was "calling in a lot of organisations this week who are relevant" to discuss how the government and tech companies can work together to ensure law enforcement can gain access to encrypted data in terrorism investigations. Rudd didn't mention any companies the government would be meeting by name — saying only it is a "fairly long list." But a Google spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that it is among the companies who will be meeting this week. The Californian tech giant declined to comment further. Shortly before the Westminster attack began, the extremist responsible used the messaging app WhatsApp. Facebook-owned WhatsApp end-to-end encrypts its messages, meaning they cannot be intercepted and read by anyone, including law enforcement or WhatsApp itself. This has kickstarted the perennial debate over encryption: Should there be "safe spaces" online, secured by encryption, that even authorities cannot access? UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd.Isabel Infantes EMPICS Entertainment/PA "There should be no place for terrorists to hide," Rudd said in an interview on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday. "We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp — and there are plenty of others like it — don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other." Google's Allo messaging app offers end-to-end encryption as an option, though it does not enable it as default. Both Apple's iMessage and Facebook's WhatsApp automatically end-to-end encrypt all messages where possible (but not Messenger, Facebook's other messaging platform). A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company would be attending the meetings, saying only in a statement: "We are horrified by the attack carried out in London earlier this week and are cooperating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations." An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. A Home Office spokesperson said the meetings would take place on Thursday, and declined to comment further. Security experts argue that any attempt to weaken encryption or introduce backdoors would make ordinary users less safe due to its use in everything from banking to government business, and would be extremely difficult to enforce given encryption tech's widespread availability online. Google has also been criticised following the attack over the accessibility of material promoting terrorism via its search engine. The Daily Mail branded it "Google, the terrorists' friend" in a highly critical front-page article.

They are not technology companies, they are platforms. And we need to make sure that stops. You are right, we will not resign from taking action if we need to do so." And prior to the Westminster attack, Google found itself at the centre of controversy after it emerged that government ads were appearing alongside extremist content on YouTube.

 Analysts predict the YouTube advertiser boycott will cost Google $750 million Julien Rath Mar. 27, 2017, 7:21 AM 63,199 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai.AP Google could lose up to $750 million from the advertiser boycott related to ads appearing next to extremist content like videos, according to a note from analysts at Nomura Instinet. According to the note, Google-owned YouTube, which relies on big brands' advertising, could take a 7.5% hit to its revenues, which are estimated to be $10.2 billion for 2017. Five of the top 20 US advertisers have frozen their advertising with Google, as have dozens more around the world. Those five companies make up 7.5% of US ad spend, according to the note. Traditional TV companies will likely look to capitalize on the boycott during the upfronts — when networks try to sell the bulk of their advertising — which run from March to May and emphasize the view that advertising on TV guarantees brand safety with large-scale audiences, according to the note. Nomura Instinet Other platforms that rely on user-generated content — such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat — could also be scrutinized more closely as a result of the boycott, the note suggested. Notes from Wall Street analysts at RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley last week, however, downplayed the effect of the advertiser boycott and maintained positive ratings of the company. Morgan Stanley, for example, said the top 100 advertisers on Google likely represented less than 20% of the company's total revenues. Analysts at Nomura say YouTube could introduce solutions to increase brand safety but that the development of those could affect the company financially. "Ad buyers are likely to demand greater direct control over ad placement, which could take time and resources to implement," the note said. Google has said it will update its ad policies, employ more people to review content, and introduce more controls for advertisers. More than 250 brands have pulled their advertising from Google's display ads network and YouTube, according to The Times. Search advertising, which makes up the bulk of Google's revenue, wouldn't be affected by the ad boycott. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Google Talk – the instant messenger that accompanies Gmail and is often referred to as “Gchat” – will no longer work from June 26. 2 The ‘Gchat’ window has become a familiar site for millions of office workers For those who would rather stare into their PCs rather than risk a conversation with their colleagues, Gmail is offering another chat feature. The email provider will replace Google Talk with Hangouts, which it said has a host of added benefits, including group video and integration with phone apps. A Google spokesperson wrote in a blogpost: “Hangouts offers advanced improvements over Google Talk such as group video calling and integration with other Google products.

Google Talk was launched in 2005 and swiftly became the MSN messenger for Gmail account holders. Eight years later, the small project was expanded into Google Hangouts. Most will already be using Google Hangouts, but the stragglers will be migrated over to the new chat box by summer. Those who check emails on their phone will be invited to switch to another SMS app or download Android Messages.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 03.27.17. 03.27.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am I Took the AI Class Facebookers Are Literally Sprinting to Get Into Getty Images Chia-Chiunn Ho was eating lunch inside Facebook headquarters, at the Full Circle Cafe, when he saw the notice on his phone: Larry Zitnick, one of the leading figures at the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research lab, was teaching another class on deep learning. Ho is a 34-year-old Facebook digital graphics engineer known to everyone as “Solti,” after his favorite conductor. He couldn’t see a way of signing up for the class right there in the app. So he stood up from his half-eaten lunch and sprinted across MPK 20, the Facebook building that’s longer than a football field but feels like a single room. “My desk is all the way at the other end,” he says. Sliding into his desk chair, he opened his laptop and surfed back to the page. But the class was already full. Internet giants have vacuumed up most of the available AI talent—and they need more. He’d been shut out the first time Zitnick taught the class, too. This time, when the lectures started in the middle of January, he showed up anyway. He also wormed his way into the workshops, joining the rest of the class as they competed to build the best AI models from company data. Over the next few weeks, he climbed to the top of the leaderboard. “I didn’t get in, so I wanted to do well,” he says. The Facebook powers-that-be are more than happy he did. As anxious as Solti was to take the class—a private set of lectures and workshops open only to company employees—Facebook stands to benefit the most. Deep learning is the technology that identifies faces in the photos you post to Facebook. It also recognizes commands spoken into Google phones, translates foreign languages on Microsoft’s Skype app, and wrangles porn on Twitter, not to mention the way it’s changing everything from internet search and advertising to cybersecurity. Over the last five years, this technology has radically shifted the course of all the internet’s biggest operations. With help from Geoff Hinton, one of the founding fathers of the deep learning movement, Google built a central AI lab that feeds the rest of the company. Then it paid more than $650 million for DeepMind, a second lab based in London. Another founding father, Yann LeCun, built a similar operation at Facebook. And so many other deep learning startups and academics have flooded into so many other companies, drawn by enormous paydays. The problem: These companies have now vacuumed up most of the available talent—and they need more. Until recently, deep learning was a fringe pursuit even in the academic world. Relatively few people are formally trained in these techniques, which require a very different kind of thinking than traditional software engineering. So, Facebook is now organizing formal classes and longterm research internships in an effort to build new deep learning talent and spread it across the company. “We have incredibly smart people here,” Zitnick says. “They just need the tools.” Related Video President Barack Obama on How Artificial Intelligence Will Affect Jobs Meanwhile, just down the road from Facebook’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters, Google is doing much the same, apparently on an even larger scale, as so many other companies struggle to deal with the AI talent vacuum. David Elkington, CEO of Insidesales, a company that applies AI techniques to online sales services, says he’s now opening an outpost in Ireland because he can’t find the AI and data science talent he needs here in the States. “It’s more of an art than a science,” he says. And the best practitioners of that art are very expensive. In the years to come, universities will catch up with the deep learning revolution, producing far more talent than they do today. Online courses from the likes of Udacity and Coursera are also spreading the gospel. But the biggest internet companies need a more immediate fix. Seeing the Future Larry Zitnick, 42, is a walking, talking, teaching symbol of how quickly these AI techniques have ascended—and how valuable deep learning talent has become. At Microsoft, he spent a decade working to build systems that could see like humans. Then, in 2012, deep learning techniques eclipsed his ten years of research in a matter of months. In essence, researchers like Zitnick were building machine vision one tiny piece at time, applying very particular techniques to very particular parts of the problem. But then academics like Geoff Hinton showed that a single piece—a deep neural network—could achieve far more. Rather than code a system by hand, Hinton and company built neural networks that could learn tasks largely on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. “We saw this huge step change with deep learning,” Zitnick says. “Things started to work.” Related Stories Cade Metz The Battle for Top AI Talent Only Gets Tougher From Here Cade Metz Google, Facebook, and Microsoft Are Remaking Themselves Around AI Cade Metz Microsoft Thinks Machines Can Learn to Converse by Making Chat a Game Cade Metz Uber Buys a Mysterious Startup to Make Itself an AI Company Cade Metz Giant Corporations Are Hoarding the World’s AI Talent For Zitnick, the personal turning point came one afternoon in the fall of 2013. He was sitting in a lecture hall at the University of California, Berkeley, listening to a PhD student named Ross Girshick describe a deep learning system that could learn to identify objects in photos. Feed it millions of cat photos, for instance, and it could learn to identify a cat—actually pinpoint it in the photo. As Girshick described the math behind his method, Zitnick could see where the grad student was headed. All he wanted to hear was how well the system performed. He kept whispering: “Just tell us the numbers.” Finally, Girshick gave the numbers. “It was super-clear that this was going to be the way of the future,” Zitnick says. Within weeks, he hired Girshick at Microsoft Research, as he and the rest of the company’s computer vision team reorganized their work around deep learning. This required a sizable shift in thinking. As a top researcher once told me, creating these deep learning systems is more like being a coach than a player. Rather than building a piece of software on your own, one line of code at a time, you’re coaxing a result from a sea of information. But Girshick wasn’t long for Microsoft. And neither was Zitnick. Soon, Facebook poached them both—and almost everyone else on the team. This demand for talent is the reason Zitnick is now teaching a deep learning class at Facebook. And like so many other engineers and data scientists across Silicon Valley, the Facebook rank and file are well aware of the trend. When Zitnick announced the first class in the fall, the 60 spots filled up in ten minutes. He announced a bigger class this winter, and it filled up nearly as quickly. There’s demand for these ideas on both sides of the equation. There’s also demand among tech reporters. I took the latest class myself, though Facebook wouldn’t let me participate in the workshops on my own. That would require access to the Facebook network. The company believes in education, but only up to a point. Ultimately, all this is about business. Going Deep The class begins with the fundamental idea: the neural network, a notion that researchers like Frank Rosenblatt explored with as far back as the late 1950s. The conceit is that a neural net mimics the web of neuron in the brain. And in a way, it does. It operates by sending information between processing units, or nodes, that stand in for neurons. But these nodes are really just linear algebra and calculus that can identify patterns in data. Related Video Don’t Freak Out Over Google’s AI Beating a Go Grandmaster. It’s a Good Thing Even in the `50s, it worked. Rosenblatt, a professor of psychology at Cornell, demonstrated his system for the New Yorker and the New York Times, showing that it could learn to identify changes in punchcards fed into an IBM 704 mainframe. But the idea was fundamentally limited—it could only solve very small problems—and in the late ’60s, when MIT’s Marvin Minsky published a book that proved these limitations, the AI community all but dropped the idea. It returned to the fore only after academics like Hinton and LeCun expanded these system so they could operate across multiple layers of nodes. That’s the “deep” in deep learning. As Zitnick explains, each layer makes a calculation and passes it to the next. Then, using a technique called “back propagation,” the layers send information back down the chain as a means of error correction. As the years went by and technology advanced, neural networks could train on much larger amounts of data using much larger amounts of computing power. And they proved enormously useful. “For the first time ever, we could take raw input data like audio and images and make sense of them,” Zitnick told his class, standing at a lectern inside MPK 20, the south end of San Francisco Bay framed in the window beside him. ‘We have incredibly smart people here. They just need the tools.’ Larry Zitnick As the class progresses and the pace picks up, Zitnick also explains how these techniques evolved into more complex systems. He explores convolutional neural networks, a method inspired by the brain’s visual cortex that groups neurons into “receptive fields” arranged almost like overlapping tiles. His boss, Yann LeCun, used these to recognize handwriting way back in the early ’90s. Then the class progresses to LSTMs—neural networks that include their own short-term memory, a way of retaining one piece of information while examining what comes next. This is what helps identify the commands you speak into Android phones. In the end, all these methods are still just math. But to understand how they work, students must visualize how they operate across time (as data passes through the neural network) and space (as those tile-like receptive fields examine each section of a photo). Applying these methods to real problems, as Zitnick’s students do during the workshops, is a process of trial, error, and intuition—kind of like manning the mixing console in a recording studio. You’re not at a physical console. You’re at a laptop, sending commands to machines in Facebook data centers across the internet, where the neural networks do their training. But you spend your time adjusting all sorts of virtual knobs—the size of the dataset, the speed of the training, the relative influence of each node—until you get the right mix. “A lot of it is built by experience,” says Angela Fan, 22, who took Zitnick’s class in the fall. A New Army Fan studied statistics and computer science as an undergraduate at Harvard, finishing just last spring. She took some AI courses, but many of the latest techniques are still new even to her, particularly when it comes to actually putting them into practice. “I can learn just from interacting with the codebase,” she says, referring to the software tools Facebook has built for this kind of work. For her, the class was part of a much larger education. At the behest of her college professor, she applied for Facebook’s “AI immersion program.” She won a spot working alongside Zitnick and other researchers as a kind of intern for the next year or two. Earlier this month, her team published new research describing a system that takes the convolutional neural networks that typically analyze photos and uses them to build better AI models for understanding natural language—that is, how humans talk to each other. This kind of language research is the next frontier for deep learning. After reinventing image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation, researchers are pushing toward machines that can truly understand what humans say and respond in kind. In the near-term, the techniques described in Fan’s paper could help improve that service on your smartphone that guesses what you’ll type next. She envisions a tiny neural network sitting on your phone, learning how you—and just you in particular—talk to other people. For Facebook, the goal is to create an army of Angela Fans, researchers steeped not just in neural networks but a range of related technologies, including reinforcement learning—the method that drove DeepMind’s AlphaGo system when it cracked the ancient game of Go—and other techniques that Zitnick explores as the course comes to a close. To this end, when Zitnick reprised the course this winter, Fan and other AI lab interns served as class TAs, running the workshops and answering any questions that came up over the six weeks of lectures. Facebook isn’t just trying to beef its central AI lab. It’s hoping to spread these skills across the company. Deep learning isn’t a niche pursuit. It’s a general technology that can potentially change any part of Facebook, from Messenger to the company’s central advertising engine. Solti could even apply it to the creation of videos, considering that neural networks also have a talent for art. Any Facebook engineer or data scientist could benefit from understanding this AI. That’s why Larry Zitnick is teaching the class. And it’s why Solti abandoned his lunch. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

One of the world’s largest engineering and technology companies has reaffirmed its commitment to the UK, despite the impending separation of the country form the EU. Siemens has today issued a bold statement that it is going nowhere despite Brexit, reaffirming its long-term commitment to London. Speaking at an event in Berlin to promote greater trade links between London and Germany, Juergen Maier, CEO of Siemens UK emphasised the importance of London and the UK as a leading market for Siemens and the opportunities for collaboration on talent and investment. “London and the UK remains an important market for Siemens and is a good place to do business. While the exact terms of the UK’s exit from the European Union are unclear, we are committed to London in the long-term. READ MORE: Post-Brexit London named best city in Europe for business “We will continue to apply our expertise in technology and engineering to the challenges that face cities, particularly urban transit and air quality. London remains a leading centre for innovation and technology and we see many opportunities for collaboration on talent, digitalisation and investment in the years ahead.” It seems like a smart move from the engineering giant, with the company already having a huge stake in the UK capital. The German giant currently employs over 15,000 people across the UK and had previously chosen London to base its global centre of competence for sustainable city technology at the Crystal, a £30m investment by the company. Seimens has also played a crucial role in the Thameslink and Crossrail projects and is set to deliver over 1,400 commuter rail carriages in London in the coming years. “London is the world’s greatest commercial centre but retaining our place at the top is always tough. This commitment by Siemens helps send the message loud and clear that London remains open to talent, investment and ideas,” said Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. “Our connections on the continent have never been more important and, regardless of Brexit, we will continue to work closely together to our mutual benefit.” Seimens joins other big names such as Google and Apple who have announced London commitments post-Brexit. Google has put forward a £1 billion investment plan for a new headquarters in King’s Cross, Facebook announced an additional 500 jobs for London and Apple revealed its plans for new headquarters in Battersea.

Hoping to bolster links, new research was pointed to which revealed London and Berlin as Europe’s two leading cities for technology investment. According to data published by London & Partners, the Mayor of London’s promotional agency, London tech firms have raised £5.4 billion since 2011, while Berlin tech companies have raised £3.3 billion – significantly more than any other European tech hub including Paris, Dublin and Amsterdam. Further analysis shows that the UK’s tech sector is continuing to attract investment following the EU referendum vote with UK tech firms attracting over £1.5 billion in venture capital investment, with London companies receiving over £1 billion. A trade delegation of 15 of London’s fastest growing technology and life sciences companies have accompanyied the Deputy Mayor, with WiredScore one of those 15. WiredScore, who provides digital connectivity ratings to the real estate sector. The certification allows landlords, property agents and tenants means of articulating the strengths of a building’s connectivity. William Newton, WiredScore EMEA Director said: “London and Berlin are world-class hubs for technology and innovation, and the commercial real estate sector in each city is thriving. We see expansion into Germany as a great opportunity and natural fit to our growing business internationally. “London has served as a great base for us to grow our business into other European markets and with the support of the Mayor’s International Business Programme, we are excited to explore the new opportunities that the Mayor’s trade mission will bring.”   Tags Brexit Homepage News List Previous ArticleWhat is Evernote?

Advertisers are demanding Google offer discounts to advertising following revelations that ads are appearing next to extremist content on YouTube. Google has come under increasing scrutiny recently, with brands worried that their products will become associated with extremist or violent content. Big companies such as AT&T, Verizon, McDonald’s, and Toyota, among many others, have all pulled ads from Google’s services in a response to the revelations. Google has released an updated version of how it plans to tackle these issues, including a broadening of what it considers ‘inappropriate content’ and a crack down on vitriolic videos aimed at groups of people or individuals. Rob Norman, Chief digital officer for Group M, told the Financial Times, that Google is also considering discounted rated for premium advertising. Eric Schmidt, the Chairman of Alphabet, during an interview on Fox Business, said: “We match ads and the content. But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match.” “Because the ads come from everywhere, every once in a while an ad will come in that someone was trying to sneak it in, if you will, get underneath our rules and violate our terms of service.” “So we can’t guarantee it, but we can get pretty close.” Over 300 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute but the prominence of ‘extremist content’ has become a real worry for some advertisers. Recently two of the platforms more popular stars, PewDiePie (54 million subscribers), and JonTron (3 million subscribers), found themselves independently embroiled in a bitter backlash over two separate instances of extreme right-wing behaviour. Whilst on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, UK home secretary, Amber Rudd, said that failure of internet companies were not doing enough to battle extremist content. Similarly, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson expressed his condemnation, telling the Sunday Times that these companies need to “stop just making money out of prurient violent material.” READ MORE: WhatsApp encryption helps terrorists hide, says Home Secretary Amber Rudd Currently the list of advertisers boycotting YouTube is continuing to grow, with Pepsi, Walmart, and Johnson & Johnson all leaving the video streaming site in the last week.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US DigitalNext Adapting to Digital Duopoly: Customization Counts By Andreas Reiffen. Published on March 27, 2017. Most Popular This is the era of duopoly in digital advertising, a time when Facebook and Google control the lion's share of the overall digital U.S. ad spend (54%), as well as the mobile ad spend (67%). The situation is even more stark when you look at incremental growth numbers: Facebook and Google together account for 98% of new digital ad dollars spent last year. Smaller players have to fight over a still significant, but ever-shrinking, share of the pie, even as other behemoths -- most notably, Amazon and Verizon -- emerge to grab at the same piece. These large players, each with proprietary tech and money to spend, seem destined to conquer every last inch of the digital advertising landscape. They won't. Digital advertising is not, as the territorial metaphors would suggest, a two-dimensional space that can be conquered and divided among large players like borders on a map. The needs of marketers are multidimensional, varied and vertical-specific. They require custom solutions as singular as the products, regions and audiences themselves. This is what the market needs but the duopoly fails to deliver; this is where independent ad tech players should concentrate their efforts. Industry observers have predicted various unsavory fates for the smaller ad tech companies: that they will face increasing pressure to consolidate, or get squeezed out entirely. They are asked to provide boutique-level quality in their services, while reducing margins and staying lean. (Like ad tech companies, publishers and agencies face this unappetizing menu of options.) For companies that want to avoid becoming isolated or getting squeezed out of the market, that want to thrive against the big boys without having a seat at the big-boy table, there is another way. It doesn't involve building scale and reach to compete with Facebook and Google, whose "walled gardens" are virtually impenetrable. It involves rigorous and unrelenting focus on developing top-notch customization capabilities for targeted verticals, and ensuring that those functions are interoperable across platforms, including within those walled gardens. In others words, there is opportunity within the advertising nooks and crannies in the land of the giants. And there -- in the niche capabilities -- is where thousands of ad tech vendors, including publishers, can find their place and profitability. Take the retail sector, which combines online and offline marketing to reach customers. If a small ad tech firm were to concentrate on and develop a specialty within fashion retail or beauty retail, they would hone their expertise in that area, differentiating themselves from other vendors. Even within retail, the difference between the customer journey in high-end fashion and CPG requires different approaches. Automotive needs a different digital strategy and different digital technologies than financial, so on and so forth. There's not a single industry whose needs are met squarely by the walled gardens. Their sheer size makes it hard for them to achieve the requisite level of dedication and focus. In truth, every vertical has its peculiarities, its nuances, its seasonalities. They all require some form of customization and special attention -- attention that neither Google nor Facebook (nor Verizon, nor Oracle, for that matter) can provide. So while the walled gardens compete for market share and maximize their breadth, they sacrifice depth and focus, not to mention the deep industry knowledge that comes with a customized and strategic managed service. Such specialization is the real opportunity for ad tech, and it's entirely in-step with the era of digital duopoly. That's a good thing, because the duopoly is not going anywhere. Ad tech needs to focus on supplementing it, not supplanting it. Hardly a day goes by where I do not read some prognostication about the duopoly and how to fight it. I believe that the task for ad tech is not to fight the duopoly as much as to figure out how coexist with it while adding demonstrable value.

Credit: Eric Feinberg/YouTube Most Popular Major marketers' ads have likely been showing up on or near YouTube videos promoting terrorism, neo-Nazi groups and other web content for a long time. So why has the brand-safety problem suddenly burst into the open, prompting big advertisers such as General Motors, Walmart, Verizon, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson to stop spending on YouTube or other Google properties? Thank -- or blame -- Eric Feinberg, a longtime marketing-services executive who in recent months has made it his mission to find ad-supported content linked to terror and hate groups, then push links and screen shots proving it happened to journalists in the U.K. and U.S. The resulting coverage has sparked a full-fledged advertiser revolt. Mr. Feinberg owns Southfield, Mich.-based Gipec, short for Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, which employs "deep web interrogation" to find keywords and coding linked to terrorism and hate speech. He's also co-owner of a patent issued in December for a "computerized system and method for detecting fraudulent or malicious enterprises." His system works in part by analyzing when videos and websites contain words that appear alongside such phrases as "kill Jews." He's logged thousands of sometimes innocuous or obscure sounding terms he says "co-trend" with such hate speech or exhortations to violence, which in turn helps him finding offensive videos. His efforts with the media have been classic problem-solution marketing. Mr. Feinberg makes no bones about his interest in licensing his technology to Google and other digital platforms to monitor offensive content and keep ads away from it. Certainly Google knows plenty about artificial intelligence and machine learning, as its executives have eagerly informed marketers in public and private presentations for years. And last week, as major advertisers one after the other pressed "pause" on YouTube advertising, Google said in a blog post that it's beefing up its tech efforts and hiring more people to prevent placement of ads with unsavory content. A spokesman declined to comment further. Eric Feinberg, who hopes to sell his system for detecting 'malicious enterprises' online to platforms such as YouTube. Credit: Eric Feinberg But Mr. Feinberg said in an interview on Friday that he doubts Google can succeed. At least, he said, "not without violating my patent." Seemingly there shouldn't be a market for what Mr. Feinberg has to sell. Brand safety, or monitoring ad placements to prevent brands from appearing alongside porn and other embarrassing content, is a standard part of offerings from digital audience measurement firms such as Moat, which in late 2015 became the first such company invited in by YouTube to monitor the site for agencies and brands. Moat CEO Jonah Goodhart declined to comment on Mr. Feinberg's system because he's not familar with it, but conceded that the ad-placement issue "is a topic that seems to be important to folks." "I don't know that an advertiser is able to see the URL where their ad runs by policy of some of the major sites," Mr. Goodhart said in an e-mail. "So one can crawl the web and find bad content, but that's a different thing than stopping an advertiser from appearing on it. Again though, I don't know him or his company so maybe they do something else." Mr. Feinberg wants to sell his tech to the digital platforms themselves, not to brands, agencies or third-party monitors. That's because he's not just out to make money, he said, but to stop terrorists and hate groups from making money off digital advertising, he said. He likened the idea of selling his tech piecemeal to brands and agencies to "fixing your toilet or sink at the house when the problem is at the sewer or the reservoir." So why have Google and seemingly sophisticated ad tech firms failed to find the stuff he keeps finding? "They aren't really understanding key trending or key words, and they're not looking for it like we do," Mr. Feinberg said. "I have a database of thousands of words and phrases linked to nefarious activity." One is a Serbian word roughly transliterated as "hanwa," which has been co-trending with jihadist content online. YouTube Red, YouTube's ad-free subscription service, advertised its movie "The Thinning" on one such "hanwa" video on Saturday, according to a link and screen shot he sent. Related Stories Who Wins and Who Loses in YouTube's Falling Out With Brands Super Bowl Ads Show Up With YouTube Videos Promoting Terror Groups, Sparking Backlash More Big Advertisers Suspend Google Ads Over Offensive Videos J&J and Verizon Join Major Marketers Suspending YouTube Advertising Whether all this will help Mr. Feinberg close a deal with Google or anyone else is hard to say. If he doesn't and Google develops its own solution, he can try to stake a patent claim. Does that make him a patent troll? He argues that he's doing something different than patent litigators that apply an obscure patent to something tech firms were already doing anyway. Mr. Feinberg, by contrast, has gone to great and public lengths in recent weeks to demonstrate that his technology can root out problems Google hasn't found. "I'm doing it for the industry," he said. "I'm an old ad guy." Certainly he's no typical ad-tech guy. He spent nearly two decades running an event marketing, promotion and social-media activation firm focused on sporting events under the name Extreme Advertising & Promotion, based variously in New York and Boca Raton, Fla. Among his efforts were branded tractor-trailer wraps during the Super Bowl in Miami in 1999. He said he's had numerous Fortune 500 clients over the years, including Motorola, General Motors, Sprint and PepsiCo. Work on NFL promotions alerted Mr. Feinberg to the problem of counterfeit licensed merchandise, prompting to him form Fans Against Kounterfeit Enterprise, or FAKE, a company focused on rooting out digital ads from largely Russian and Chinese purveyors of fake but authentic-looking goods. He said he also began five years ago working with musicians to track down pirated videos on YouTube and elsewhere, so they could either have them taken down or get compensated. Two years ago, following the terror attack in France on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper, he began turning his attention to terrorist-linked content online. "I'm sickened by it," Mr. Feinberg said, contrasting ads supporting terrorism and hate groups to what he did in brand promotions. "I'm proud of what I did," he said. "That's why I'm doing this. It's a level of passion."

So the team started to ask — what if we looked at this problem in an entirely new way? What if, instead of trying to solve it with better hardware, we could do it with smart software choices instead?” The division highlighted the development of the Google Glass camera in its blog post Friday. Read: Google Glass 2 Arrives For Businesses​ The Google Pixel came with a 12-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX 378 sensor and an 8-megapixel front camera with a Samsung S5K4H8/Omnivision OV8856 sensor. But, the hardware alone does not deserve all the credit for the cameras’ performance. Google was able to get the most out of the Google Pixel hardware by using a special software called Gcam. The development of Gcam started in 2011, in the quest for a camera that could fit into the Google Glass — an AR-enabled pair of glasses made by Google with a camera attached. The reason the special camera needed to be developed was that the purpose of the Google Glass was to give the wearer the ability to shoot photos from a first-person vantage point and share the experience easily. The fact that the company could only fit in a small camera on the glass and had to get the light, focus and image sensing correct on very limited battery power was a challenge it needed to overcome to make the Google Glass work.

An Image taken in HDR+ Mode developed using computational photography. Photo: Blog.X.Company Another technique explored by the Gcam team was image fusion, which involved taking a sequence of shots and then compiling them into a single, higher quality image. This technique helped the Google device take more detailed shots, even in low light. The same technology was appropriated to the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 Android camera apps and finally rolled out to the Google Pixel smartphone. Read: Google Pixel Has EIS, Not OIS Gcam’s next project includes machine-learning capabilities and how they could work in conjunction with computational photography. “One direction that we’re pushing is machine learning. There’s lots of possibilities for creative things that actually change the look and feel of what you’re looking at. That could mean simple things like creating a training set to come up with a better white balance. Or what’s the right thing we could do with the background — should we blur it out, should we darken it, lighten it, stylize it? We’re at the best place in the world in terms of machine learning, so it’s a real opportunity to merge the creative world with the world of computational photography,” Marc Levoy, principal engineer at Google, said in the company's blog post Friday.

 Why you won't see Unilever announcing it is pulling its ads from YouTube Lara O'Reilly Mar. 27, 2017, 6:38 AM 2,848 facebook linkedin twitter email print Unilever chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed.Unilever Unilever's marketing chief Keith Weed has long been vocal about the need for digital platforms to be more accountable around what he dubs the "3Vs": Value, viewability, and verification. But despite the high-profile disquiet around brand ads appearing next to extremist content on YouTube, Weed says Unilever — which owns brands including Axe, Magnum, and Lipton — won't be joining the growing list of global advertisers saying they are suspending their campaigns from Google's video ad platform. Speaking to Business Insider and a small group of journalists (a briefing also attended by Google's Europe boss Matt Brittin) ahead of Advertising Week Europe, which took place in London last week, Weed said: "The best way to do negotiations with any supplier is one-on-one and in private, so you won't find us coming out and making public statements." Weed did reveal that Unilever and Google had "an incredibly difficult conversation" about viewability — the measure of which an ad had the ability to be seen by a human — two years ago, which "did affect then what I was willing to invest in YouTube." Historically, Unilever also took issue with Google and other platforms like Facebook and Twitter over verification and their willingness to open its platforms up to third-party measurement firms. A conversation with Google's head of product at its headquarters in Mountain View in 2014 led to Weed coming up with the phrase "marking your own homework" — or "grading your own homework" in the US, he joked. The phrase has since been adopted by a number of prominent figures in the advertising industry — including WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell — when calling for digital platforms to provide greater transparency over their metrics. Speaking with Business Insider after the briefing, Weed said: "The debate back then was I want to be able to understand what counts as a view and then, within that, what third-party verification was in place for me to be able to say that it's a definite view and that they are not marking their own homework. A view on some platforms not so long ago was just an ad being served. So if you were on a PC and you were looking at the top of the page, an ad was being served at the bottom of the page [where a user may not scroll], you were paying for that. I hasten to add, Unilever wasn't, but I can guarantee a huge amount of people were." Weed says the current industry-standard for a view — 50% of the pixels of an ad seen for 1 second or more — doesn't go far enough. He says a view should be 100% of the pixels seen. On video, he says half of the ad must have been watched to count as a view — versus the industry-standard of 50% of the pixels for 2 continuous seconds. "I was saying [back during discussions with Google in 2015] I'm not taking a stance against YouTube or any other platform, I'm taking a stance about what I'm willing to pay for. This is my criteria, if you don't match that criteria, at the end of the day, it's Unilever dollars. If you don't match that criteria, that's fair enough. But our dollars will follow where that criteria exists," Weed said. Marc Pritchard, the chief marketing officer at consumer goods giant P&G, delivered two landmark speeches earlier this year in which he gave its agencies and suppliers a year's notice to get audited and open themselves up to accredited third-party verification services. Media agency The&Partnership's founder Johnny Hornby said advertisers and agencies should set a "Cannes deadline" — referring to the Cannes Lions advertising industry event that takes place in June — for Google and Facebook to sort out issues such as ad fraud and ad misplacement, or else the industry should cut its spend on those platforms Weed said the progress digital platforms have made on those types of areas over the past couple of years has been "fantastic," although they are still not where they should be. But he doesn't plan to put an public deadline on his demands, like his biggest competitor has. Instead, Unilever is giving individual companies separate, private deadlines. Industry-wide definitions run the risk of lowering the bar, so that everyone else can step over it, Weed explained. "What you won't catch me doing as I've seen some people saying: 'The industry must address this by September' or something. These are unrealistic expectations to set out. Does the industry as a whole need to put more pressure on media companies to resolve this quickly? Absolutely. Do I applaud more people getting involved in this conversation and holding the industry to account? Absolutely. The more people that understand and make the right choices the better," Weed said. While Unilever is working to hold media companies to account for the quality of ad inventory they offer on their platforms, Weed said it's also incumbent on marketers to protect themselves. Unilever uses third-party verification services that check websites before it places ads on them to make sure they will be appearing in safe environments. It's something the company has been doing for years and one of the reasons why he is surprised discussions around brand safety, verification, and ad fraud seem to be flaring up right now. Weed said: "I reflected recently on why does there seem to be more press about it? Maybe just more people caught on to what was going on and that also includes journalists ... I think this is a little concerning because this is a fast moving world ... and in a fast moving world, I think everyone needs to keep themselves tooled up and sharp with what's going on ... Some of the comments I'm seeing in the press right now, it's easy to blame one person, and they [Google] have the biggest accountability, but we all need to do our homework." For its part, Unilever puts all its 5,500 marketers — from junior employees to its executive committee — through compulsory digital training modules on subjects such as SEO or big data. If they fail, they must complete the test again. Weed said: "Marketers need to tool up. I'm a great believer in building capabilities and skills. There isn't a football team that sits around eating crisps and drinking beer all week that then gets up on a Saturday morning gives it their best. No, they train and they coach. I think if you want to be an elite marketer, just like if you want to be an elite footballer, you need to train and coach." Get the latest Google stock price here.

The move follows intense pressure from copyright holders, who said that a change in the law would hurt artists' ability to get fairly paid for their work. Due to what some have described as a drafting error in Australia’s implementation of the Australia – US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA), so-called safe harbor provisions currently only apply to commercial Internet service providers Down Under. This means that while local ISPs such as Telstra receive protection from copyright infringement complaints, platforms such as Google, Facebook and YouTube face legal uncertainty. In order to put Australia on a similar footing to technology companies operating in the United States, proposed amendments to the Copyright Act would’ve seen enhanced safe harbor protections for technology platforms such as search engines and social networks. But that dream has now received a considerable setback after the amendments were withdrawn at the eleventh hour. In a blow to Google, Facebook and others, the government dropped the amendments before they were due to be introduced to parliament yesterday. That came as a big surprise, particularly as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had given the proposals his seal of approval just last week. “Provisions relating to safe harbor were removed from the bill before its introduction to enable the government to further consider feedback received on this proposal whilst not delaying the passage of other important reforms,” Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said in a statement. There can be little doubt that intense lobbying from entertainment industry groups played their part, with a series of articles published in ‎News Corp-owned The Australian piling on the pressure in favor of rightsholders. This week the publication accused Google and others of “ruthlessly exploiting” safe harbor protections in the US and Europe, forcing copyright holders into an expensive and time-consuming battle to have infringing content taken down. While large takedown efforts are indeed underway in both of those regions, companies like Google argue that doing business in countries without safe harbor provisions presents a risk to business development and innovation. Being held responsible for millions of other people’s infringements could prove massively costly and certainly not worth the risk. Startup advocacy group StartupAUS criticized the withdrawal of the amendments, describing the move as “a blow to Australian entrepreneurs.” “Australia’s copyright laws have still not caught up with the realities of the internet. As a result, the laws still struggle to provide clarity and protection for organizations doing business online,” said CEO Alex McCauley. “Copyright safe harbor is international best practice and without it Australian startups will be held back from participating in the rich global market for content and ideas. We strongly urge the government to reconsider the need for safe harbor provisions.” But for players in the entertainment industry, safe harbor protections are not something to be quickly revisited without significant preparation. Welcoming their withdrawal, Dan Rosen, chief executive of the Australian Recording Industry Association, called for a “full, independent and evidence-based review” in advance of similar proposals being raised in the future.

The new model -- the fourth iteration of the accessory that turns various Samsung Galaxy phones into a virtual reality helmet -- now includes a dedicated controller, too. While the nascent virtual reality movement has struggled since bursting on to the scene in 2016, the Gear VR has been a bona fide hit. In fact, with over 5 million Gear VR headsets sold as of January, Gear VR may well be a larger VR platform than Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR combined. (The Gear VR incorporates Oculus tech, too.) Yes, the Gear VR had more than a headstart of more than a year. (The original model went on sale in December 2014.) And a lot of those "sales" were freebie giveaways with Galaxy S phones. But that's exactly the point: That formula has worked out well, and Samsung looks to repeat the same playbook for the S8. And it doesn't hurt that, even at full price, the Gear VR is also one of the best VR platforms for the money. Big dog in VR The ultra-cheap Google Cardboard may beat Gear VR on numbers if you count all the giveaways handed out over the years, but it's also not a platform in the same way: there isn't a Cardboard app store, per se. Gear VR, like the Daydream View -- which is basically Google's answer to Gear VR -- is connected to its own app ecosystem. It's more finely-tuned. And, it's far more of an immersive experience. No, Gear VR isn't as advanced as a Vive, Oculus Rift or PlayStation VR. You can't walk through rooms or lean into objects. Like with Google Daydream or Google Cardboard, you need to sit down or stand still and turn your head around to look at things. But its impressive app library includes a host of channels for 360-degree videos and streaming 360-degree content. For viewing films or immersive 360-degree projects, Gear VR is portable, easy and comfortable. It's an ideal basic VR viewer. The upcoming Gear VR Controller should be the type of magic wand that the headset has desperately needed, versus the Xbox-style Bluetooth gamepads that worked with previous models. A new wave of apps and games should take advantage of the controller in new ways: navigation, interaction and as a substitute for free-range VR walking-around. On Google Daydream, the included remote makes using Google StreetView easier. I can use the remote to click around apps and browse videos as well as photos. Daydream View works with a growing range of Android phones, but the selection (Pixel, Moto Z and a few others) just can't compare to the popularity of Samsung. Even in the shadow of the Galaxy Note 7 recall fiasco, Samsung is still neck-and-neck with Apple when it comes to worldwide handset marketshare. And that gives Gear VR a huge leg up. Galaxy S8, with VR along for the ride Maybe you shouldn't buy a high-end VR headset if you're not ready to accept its limitations and imperfections. But with a street price of under $100, £80 or AU$160 (for the 2016 version, anyway) -- and those freebie bundles accompanying earlier Galaxy phone launches -- Gear VR has been a perfectly-priced thing to buy. The headset remains one of my favorite casual ways to try new VR videos. Its larger library of apps and better fit on my face still make me prefer it to Google Daydream, for now. And that's before the upcoming controller's potential benefits. The Galaxy S8 may not enable any new VR possibilities, either. But that doesn't make the Gear VR any less key for the Galaxy phones going forward. Gear VR still only works with a certain set of Samsung phones, and literally requires the phone as its display. In that sense, a new Galaxy phone -- undoubtedly faster -- is also a Gear VR hardware revamp. How do you get people to wear VR? It's a question I struggle with, as my own headsets sit unused on my desk at home. Owning a piece of the puzzle helps. The more Galaxy S8 owners there are, possibly with Gear VR headsets, the more likely they are to try it. And right now, VR still needs all the help it can get. Facebook and Oculus are aiming for VR to go increasingly mobile. Gear VR, in that sense, is still one of the clearest pathways to that future. And the Galaxy S8 might be its best fast lane.         LATEST STORIES (4) Syrian Army Forces Strike Terrorists' Defense Lines in Maarzaf, North of Hama Syrian Pro-Gov't Forces Regain Territory in Counter-Offensive near Mahardah Syria: Over 250 Gunmen Leave Key District in Homs City Iraqi Security Forces Resume Anti-Terrorist Operation in Western Mosul Nuclear Disarmament: The Myth of UN Conference…Again Iran, My Beautiful Country: Nowruz Passengers in Shiraz Syrian Army Scores more Victories against ISIL along Aleppo-Raqqa Highway Syrian Troops Block ISIL Terrorists in Northeast Aleppo amid Fighting Syrian Armed Forces Hit Terrorists' Centers Hard West of Aleppo Province Syria: Kurdish-Led Fighters Push ISIL back from More Positions in Western Raqqa Senior Terrorist Commander Killed in Clashes with Syrian Army in Hama Syrian Army Discovers US-Made Arms in Terrorists' Positions in Aleppo Province Syrian Army Makes Fresh Advances in Eastern Damascus, Kills Hundreds of Terrorists Syria: Hundreds of Gunmen, Family Members Leave Key District in Homs Syrian Army Wards off Terrorists' Attack in Northern Homs Syrian Army Forces Strike Terrorists' Defense Lines in Maarzaf, North of Hama TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army units and their allies eliminated dozens of Nusra terrorists' vehicles and killed a number of militants during an assault near the town of Maarzaf in the Northwestern part of Hama province.

The company’s suit against Amazon was filed in the same court on Friday, March 24. Uniloc, which claimed that it owns a number of patents in the text/voice instant messaging field, alleged both companies had infringed three patents. Google is alleged to have infringed US patent numbers 8,724,622; 8,995,433; and 7,535,890.  Patent ‘622, which is called “System and method for instant VoIP messaging”, has been infringed by Google’s voice and mobile messaging Allo, according to the suit.  Amazon is alleged to have infringed US patent numbers 8,571,194; 7,804,948; and 7,853,000.  The three patents are all called “System and method for initiating a conference call”, and Amazon is claimed to have infringed them through its voice and messaging app Amazon Chime. Uniloc is seeking a jury trial, damages, costs and expenses, and further relief that the court deems just and proper.  In September last year, WIPR reported that Uniloc had targeted a number of technology brands, including LG Electronics and Motorola, in patent suits.  That wasn’t the first time Uniloc had filed patent claims against several companies, with numerous news sites calling the business a ‘patent troll’.

Now, Google Play is adding a new section dubbed 'Free App of the Week' which will highlight the weekly offer on popular apps. The new Free App of the Week section in Google Play is not visible currently in India. Though, we can expect the feature to be rolled out soon. The Google Play is currently listing the Card Wars: Adventure Time in the Free App of the Week section, and shows that the app is free for now while it carries a pricing of $2.99. The listing also confirms that the app is free for another five days. The new Free App of the Week section can be spotted on the Apps page in the Play store, and can be seen on the mobile as well as desktop. The new section will certainly help highlight deals on some popular apps during any week. The new Free App of the Week listing was spotted by Android Police. In the meanwhile, another change has been spotted on the Google Play app - a revamp of the My Apps section. Now, apps will be divided into four tabs - Updates, Installed, Library, and Beta. Users will also be able to sort apps in the Installed and Library tabs with alphabetical order, last updated, last used, and size. The revamped My Apps section was first spotted by Twitter user @YTSecurity, and shared by 9to5Google. One of the biggest changes that Google brought for developers recently was a way to display sales on their apps. The feature offered developers option to add strikethrough pricing for running their own price promotions on paid apps and games, while showing the original price above. Google Play is also expected to get an all-new editorial page soon. The new editorial page in Google Play will allow the company's editors to hand pick games offering optimal gaming experiences on Android. Google Play recently completed its five years, and marked the occasion by releasing a list of most successful games, apps, and other content that has been downloaded from its Android store.

[INFO HERE] Oct & Dec: Brussels & Miami Close 3p Podium Media Kit When Boycotts Work: Breitbart, YouTube in Tailspin Over Hate Speech by Tina Casey on Monday, Mar 27th, 2017 Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Sleeping Giants seems to have found the magic key that makes boycotts work. Last week the anti-hate organization announced that more than 1,500 companies have blocked their ads from appearing on Breitbart, a purported news organization that has billed itself as a “platform” for the Alt-right. Sleeping Giants also supports action against Google and its YouTube video service for failing to police hate speech and other offensive content. In the latest bad news for YouTube, Ad Age reports that Verizon and Johnson & Johnson joined a growing list of brands that have suspended advertising on the site. When boycotts work: Part I Boycotts are notoriously fickle and difficult to engineer successfully. The key that Sleeping Giants uncovered is similar to the methodology employed by #GrabYourWallet. Rather than getting individual consumers to stop buying specific products, Sleeping Giants went after a much bigger target: advertisers. (Similarly, #GrabYourWallet — which calls for a boycott of products linked to U.S. President Donald Trump and his family members — aims at retail companies.) The focus on high-profile companies ensures the boycott effort is regularly in the public spotlight, at least in business media, trade publications and social media. Johnson & Johnson, for example, made this dynamic clear in a public statement it emailed to Ad Age about its decision to suspend advertising on YouTube: “The Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies takes this matter very seriously, and we have made the decision to pause all YouTube digital advertising globally to ensure our product advertising does not appear on channels that promote offensive content. … We will continue to take every measure to ensure our brand advertising is consistent with our brand values.” As reported in the U.K. publication the Times and elsewhere, advertisers are fleeing Google and YouTube in droves — and the boycott is rapidly accelerating: “The decision by major U.S. brands to yank ads, first reported by the Times in the United Kingdom, suggests that an advertiser boycott that began overseas is quickly spreading,” USA Today reported last week. More than 250 organizations — including the British government, Toyota and McDonald’s — have stopped advertising on YouTube in the U.K., the Times reported. The blowback grew so hot that Google was forced to respond. In a recent blog post Google’s chief business officer, Philip Schindler, reassured advertisers that the company had already begun “ramping up changes” in its ad policies, enforcement systems, and provisions for advertisers to gain more control. Alphabet catches Google flak In short, the media attention forces companies defend their corporate social responsibility profiles, and practically the only way they can do that is to join the boycott. And if they’re smart, they’ll take action before the spotlight turns on them. Google’s action may be too little, too late. The boycott appears to be having a ripple effect on Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Check out this alarming headline that appeared on CNBC.com on March 20: “Google stock is downgraded as advertisers start to worry about where their ads are appearing.” Here’s the money quote from CNBC: “Pivotal Research Group downgraded Alphabet stock from buy to hold on Monday after media buying agency Havas pulled spending from YouTube and Google Display Network in the U.K. last week.” Ouch! When boycotts work: Part II Behavior change is the aim of most boycotts, and in that regard the Google/YouTube action is doing quite well. The Breitbart boycott, which is the main focus of the Sleeping Giants campaign, falls into a different category. It can be illustrated by this famous exchange from the 1964 James Bond movie “Goldfinger”: James Bond: “Do you expect me to talk?” Auric Goldfinger: “No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!” The ultimate aim of the Sleeping Giants campaign is to put Breitbart out of business, as the potential to force behavior change is extremely low if not impossible. The classic lightbulb joke is helpful here: Q: How many Psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb? A: Only one, but the bulb has got to really WANT to change. Corporate social responsibility is an effective lever only against companies that are part of the CSR movement. With 1,500 advertisers down and still counting, Breitbart must be feeling at least some effect of the Sleeping Giants campaign. In a report last week, though, Reuters cautioned that advertisers still need to keep their guard up, even after they have taken steps to suspend their ads from Breitbart or other sites. That’s because third-party ad buys can trip up unwary companies. Reuters cites this example involving the popular online platform Disqus: “Ads from album creation site Mixbook and online invitation company Paperless Post could still be seen on Breitbart’s website as recently as last week, according to a review by Reuters, even after they each blocked the site last fall,” reported Jessica Toonkel of Reuters. “… Both Mixbook and New York-based marketing technology company Magnetic, on behalf of a client, said they had discovered ads showing up on Breitbart, which they had blacklisted, through Web addresses owned by Disqus, the company that powers Breitbart’s comment section.” Disqus Chief Executive Daniel Ha told Reuters that its relationship with Breitbart allowed for it to sell ads on the site. Once advertisers began complaining, Disqus terminated the practice. Breitbart forever! No matter how many companies desert Breitbart, it’s possible that the site will continue publishing offensive content as long as it likes. That’s partly because one of Breitbart’s owners is the Mercer family, which put millions into the effort to elect Donald Trump. If the family is willing to make up for the loss of ad revenue out of their own pockets, Breitbart could stay alive — boycott or no boycott. Perhaps the next target for boycott will be Renaissance Technologies, the investment management company run by Robert Mercer.

Whether you're a developer or not you get a sneak peek at upcoming features that may soon be coming to your phone. Popular Searches Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 856.81 +9.79 +1.16% General Motors Co GM ▲ 35.54 +0.84 +2.41% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 143.95 +3.07 +2.18% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▲ 29.64 +0.47 +1.60% Google released Tuesday the developer version of its next Android OS currently called just O. Some of O's most exciting features are better battery life, easier controls for notifications and picture-in-picture video for both phones and tablets. There's no guarantee all these features will be in the full release some time later this year. 1. Battery life Improving the battery life is one of the biggest and most welcomed features of Android O. Similar to iOS, Android O will limit and manage what apps do in the background while multiple apps are open. This is one of those "behind the curtain" features that you'll appreciate even if you can't see exactly how it works. For example, if you are using Instagram but have Google Maps open in the background, location services will update the location less frequently for Maps to keep it from draining your battery as fast.  2. Notifications channels Notifications have always been one of the perennial strong features of Android. In O, you can group your notifications into channels or as Google describes it: "app-defined categories for notification content". So if you had a channel of apps that are all "news" related, you could interact and control notification settings for all the apps in the news channel at once. 3. Snooze notifications Sometimes as wonderful as notifications are, you just need them to be quiet for a little while. Android O gives you the ability to snooze notifications simply by sliding your finger across a notification and then selecting how long to snooze it for: 15, 30 or 60 minutes. 4. Picture-in-picture While we've seen picture-in-picture video for the iPad, we've yet to see it fully functioning on a phone. Android O brings the ability to keep a video playing while interacting with another app. To what extent this feature is incorporated by video apps like Netflix and HBO Now remains to be seen. But hopefully you'll be able to keep watching "Game Of Thrones" as you check the weather to see if winter is indeed coming. (Spoiler: It is.) 5. Lock screen shortcuts On the lock screen in Android Nougat there is a microphone icon for quick access to Google Assistant and a camera icon for quick access to take a picture. Android O will allow you to customize your lock screen with even more shortcuts. 6. Autofill system wide If you use a password manager app, Android O gives you easy yet secure access to it across your device via autofill. You will be able to select which password manager app you want to take advantage of a system wide autofill feature. This is similar to the way you can now select which keyboard to use across your apps on your phone. 7. Wide-gamut color What the heck is wide-gamut color? Exactly. While this feature might not mean much to you now, it's really about future proofing. As displays improve with newer phones and tablets, your apps will be able to take full advantage of all the colors and their subtleties. Just imagine how amazing all your cat pics will look. 8. HiFi Bluetooth audio Your phone will now be able to wirelessly stream higher quality audio. Obviously, to fully hear the higher quality depends on the quality of the audio recording and the speaker or headphone with which you're listening to it. This is a big plus for any audiophiles out there. 9. Keyboard shortcuts Good news if you use a keyboard with an Android tablet: Android O gives better support for developers to make navigation and shortcuts easier to use via a physical keyboard. Could this pave the wa for Android laptops, and maybe Chromebooks?  What's next for O?  This is a very early build of Android O so we can't say what other features will be added in the future. It's so early, that we don't even know what sweet treat Android O is named after! Oreo? Oatmeal cookie? Orangesicle? We have a few guesses as to what O could actually be. We are bound to learn more in depth about the features we highlighted as well as any new ones at Google's annual software developer conference I/O, in May.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

 The 10 things in advertising you need to know today Julien Rath Mar. 27, 2017, 5:08 AM 1,380 facebook linkedin twitter email print CEO cofounder of Instagram, Kevin Systrom. Vivien Killilea / Getty Images Good morning. Here's everything you need to know in the world of advertising today. 1. Brand safe ads are more expensive than standard YouTube video ads. A chart from Enders Analysis showing the illustration of cost and brand safety by online video type shows direct-sold broadcaster video ads are the most likely to be brand safe — but come at the highest cost. 2. Instagram announced it has reached the 1 million advertisers per month landmark. The number of monthly advertisers has grown from 200,000 a year ago. 3. The YouTube ad boycott will have little financial impact on Google, according to notes from RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley. The revenue from display advertising and ads on the video platform make up only 10% of the company's net revenues — and not every advertiser is pulling their spend. 4. Google wants to use Assistant as a way to connect all devices. An engineer for the company revealed Google is experimenting with using voice commands on one device to take actions on another. 5. More US brands suspended their advertising with Google. General Motors and FX Networks have joined the growing list of companies halting their spend. 6. Mattel and ABC are creating a TV show to find its next big toy. The show, to be titled "Toy Box," will be in the style of "Shark Tank," according to Adweek. 7. The "Fearless Girl" statue will stay on Wall Street until 2018. The extension until February 2018 was announced by New York City's mayor Bill de Blasio, the NY Daily News reported. 8. YouTube's own ads are running alongside offensive content. Commercials for the video platform's premium service Red were found running before objectionable content, Adweek reported. 9. Walmart has made move into promotions around sports. The retailer partnered with the promoter of sports entertainment facilities Oak View Group to become the big box retailer of 21 retailers around the US, The Drum reported. 10. GroupM ended a legal dispute with the compliance arm of Ebiquity, Firm Decisions. A trial, over the alleged "misuse" of confidential documents, was scheduled to go ahead later this year, Campaign reported.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Android O Launcher backported to work on Android 6 or higher JC Torres - Mar 27, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit One of the strengths of Android is its (mostly) open nature. While that can of course be abused to some extent, it has allowed users to enjoy features that would have been otherwise inaccessible to them, whether because they’re using a different brand of phone or their device isn’t officially supported. Take for example the latest version of the Google Pixel Launcher, formerly Google Now Launcher, which came with the recently announced Android O Developer Preview. Now that has been made avaiable, unofficially, of course, to any Android device running Android Marshmallow or later. Another advantage of Android’s open nature is that you can change home screens and app launchers as much as you want. They are practically just like regular Android apps that just happens to have some special behaviors and capabilities. That also means that it’s certainly possible to extract a home screen’s APK, distribute it, and install it elsewhere. Of course, that’s only half the story in this particular context. linuxct, who made the post on XDA, had to also backport the O Pixel Launcher. That means making it work for older versions Android, though the absolute minimum is Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The best part of this backport is that it works without root access, though the Google Now sidebar won’t work unless it’s installed as a system app. Most users who’ve tried it have reported no problems, though there are a few who did run into issues. Fortunately, most of those can be resolved by restarting the phone. It’s nothing to get excited over, though, at least not yet. Those already on Nougat won’t find too much differences. The only known benefit is that you can now swipe up from anywhere on the screen to bring up the app drawer. Previously, you could only swipe up from the dock at the bottom of the screen. Those still on Android Marshmallow might benefit the most from the new Pixel Launcher, though they might have better luck using the Nougat backport instead.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social Google working on a social photo editing app: Report Google working on a social photo editing app: Report Google is working on a new social app for photo sharing editing and sharing, according to a new report. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: March 27, 2017 2:40 pm Google could be working on a new app that allows groups to edit photos together, then organise them. Google is working on a new social app for photo sharing editing and sharing. The news comes from TechCrunch, which notes that the app allows groups to edit photos together, and then organise them. The tech publication describes the app as “Path meets Snapchat-style filters and edits meets Google’s imaging smarts”. Path, once a quite popular app, primarily focused on a small group of friends to share photos. Google even tried to acquire the app, however, it was sold to Korean messaging giant Kakao in 2015. Apple has recently announced a similar app called Clips, which lets users to quickly edit videos and add visual elements to them, similar to Snapchat. However, Google’s upcoming app will be slightly different. Google’s app has a social element to it which will allow users to collaborate and create groups to share and edit photos. Also read: Apple Clips is the iMovie equivalent for the social media generation During Google I/O 2016, the company introduced two social apps, Allo and Duo. The former is a smart messaging app, while the latter is Google’s answer to FaceTime. However, Google hasn’t been able to generate much hype around its social apps. But the search giant isn’t ready to stop focusing on the social element. In another report, from Engadget, a Google spokesperson told the tech blog that the new app is just an experiment. Unconfirmed sources told TechCrunch that the company might announce the app at the upcoming Google I/O in May. So, it’s not clear exactly when Google plans to release the app. It’s also possible that the app’s features may end up baked into Google Photos.

As Google prepares to launch its smart speaker Google Home in the UK, we take a look at how it stacks up against its number one rival Amazon Echo  Share  Comments BySophie Curtis 12:52, 28 MAR 2017 Technology Google Home vs Amazon Echo  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email If you thought that speakers were just for listening to music, it's time to think again. A new battleground has emerged in the war for the "smart home". Web-connected speakers that not only play music but offer helpful information and obey spoken commands are jostling for a place in your living room. At the end of last year, Amazon finally released its Echo speaker in the UK - over a year after launching the device in the US. Echo comes with an integrated voice assistant called Alexa that can answer questions, make to-do lists, set alarms and provide weather, traffic and other information in real-time. Now Google is preparing to launch its rival device, called Google Home, with its own voice assistant that can perform many of the same tasks. Google Home is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco (Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) So how do the two devices stack up? And which one will win the battle for your heart, and your home? Design Amazon Echo is a 23.5 cm tall cylindrical speaker with a diameter of 8.3cm. It is fairly heavy compared to other wireless speakers, and somewhat monolithic in appearance. The bottom half of the device is covered by a speaker grille, while the top of Echo has a ring of light that you can turn to adjust volume, and buttons for mute and activation. The speaker only comes in black and white colour options. Amazon introduced Amazon Echo at a product launch in London By contrast, Google Home is quite squat - with a shape supposedly inspired by wine glasses and candles. It has a sloped top, with a touch-capacitive display and four coloured LED lights to provide visual feedback, and a single physical mute button on the back, which you can press to prevent Google from listening to "hot words". The bottom of the unit is covered by a speaker grille and can be swapped out for different coloured shells to suit your personal taste. There are six shell options in fabric or metal. Google Home comes in six shell options Read More Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on review: First impressions of Google's new smartphones Sound If you're going to invest in a speaker, the most important thing is that it sounds good. Amazon Echo is a 1.0 channel speaker, meaning that it is a single speaker with one tweeter and one woofer. That's pretty basic considering that, for most people, playing music will be its primary function. Amazon Echo Meanwhile, Google Home boasts a "high-excursion driver" with a "dual passive radiator" design that Google claims delivers "crystal-clear highs and deep lows". That means a lot of big sound from a small package. Google Home speakers can also be synced together, or used to control other speakers that have a Chromecast Audio device plugged into them, essentially creating a multi-room speaker system. Read More Google Home speaker Google Home UK release date Google Home vs Amazon Echo Google's answer to Amazon Echo Google Home latest news and rumours Voice assistant Amazon's voice assistant Alexa is capable of understanding simple commands, or even a series of commands, but she can't conduct two-way conversations. Alexa's default search engine is Bing, meaning that responses to all the questions you ask will be derived form the Microsoft-owned search engine. Amazon Echo You have to phrase your questions in the right way to get the answers you want, but Amazon claims the more you use Echo, the more Alexa will adapt to your speech patterns, vocabulary and personal preferences. Google Assistant taps into the superior power of Google's search engine, allowing you to ask more complex questions in a more natural way. You can also ask follow-up questions, so it feels more like a conversation. Moreover, the Assistant on Google Home is the same as the Assistant built into Android smartphones, so data can be shared across both devices. Google Home The irritating thing about Google Assistant is that it doesn't have a name, so whereas you can wake up Amazon's assistant by just saying "Alexa", with Google Home you have to say "OK Google" every time you want to talk to it. Compatibility Where Amazon Echo excels is in its compatibility with other apps. The speaker already boasts Uber, Skyscanner, National Rail, and JustEat among its "skills", as well as several smart home appliances such as Hive, Netatmo and Philips Hue. In fact, Amazon claims that more than 130 apps are supported by Amazon Echo and Alexa voice commands. Alexa is a virtual assistant for your home Google Home can link up with Philips Hue, Nest, Samsung SmartThings and IFTTT - as well as its own Chromecast devices - but that's about it so far. Both the Echo and Home are compatible with the most common music streaming services - most notably Spotify and TuneIn. With the Echo, you can tap into Amazon's own music library and Prime Music offerings, while the Home links up with Google Play Music and YouTube Music. Price and availability Amazon Echo echo went on sale in the UK on 28 September, at a price of £149.99. It is available at Argos, Currys, John Lewis, PC World, and Tesco, as well as from Amazon itself. Read More Amazon Echo release: How to pre-order your speaker, Prime member deals and pricing ahead of UK launch Google Home is not yet available in the UK, but has gone on sale in the US for $129. Google Home (Photo: Reuters) Even if Google decides to convert that number into pounds when it crosses the pond, it will still be over £20 cheaper than Amazon's rival. Verdict In many aspects, Google Home seems to come out on top in the battle of the smart speakers. It's smaller, more customisable, and its voice assistant is powered by Google search, which many regard as superior to Bing. On the other hand, it's early days for the device - no one in the UK has had a chance to put it through its paces yet, and it lacks the breadth of integrations with third party apps that Amazon Echo boasts.

However, if you're willing to hold out a little longer, you may find that Google Home has more to offer.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 27 March 2017 | MYT 4:00 PM Google ad crisis spreads as biggest marketers halt spending Controversial: The London-based Times newspaper reported that some ads were running with YouTube videos that promoted terrorism or anti-Semitism. — Bloomberg Google’s advertising crisis went global after some of the biggest marketers including AT&T Inc. and Johnson & Johnson halted spending on YouTube and the Internet company’s display network, citing concern their ads would run alongside offensive videos. The controversy erupted last week after the London-based Times newspaper reported that some ads were running with YouTube videos that promoted terrorism or anti-Semitism. The UK government and the Guardian newspaper took down ads from the video site and Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its UK clients’ ads from Google’s display ad network and YouTube. On Wednesday, the boycott spread across the Atlantic as US companies that are among the heaviest ad spenders pulled back, potentially costing Google and YouTube hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business. AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc, the largest US wireless carriers, said they had stopped non-search advertising spending with Google. Johnson &Johnson, the world’s biggest health-care company, paused all YouTube advertising globally. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” a spokeswoman for AT&T said in a statement Wednesday. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” To shield its brand, Verizon took the same action. It’s also started an investigation, Sanette Chao, a Verizon spokeswoman, said in a statement. Search represents the lion’s share of Google’s advertising revenue, which totaled US$79.4bil (RM350.3bil) last year. However, large advertisers such as AT&T tend to spend more heavily across Google’s video and display advertising network. AT&T is the fourth-largest advertiser in the US, spending US$941.96mil (RM4.15bil) in 2016, according to Kantar Media, and Verizon is No. 3. Google’s network business, which serves display ads on other websites, generated US$4.4bil (RM19.4bil) in fourth-quarter revenue, about 20% of the company’s total ad sales. While YouTube revenue isn’t reported separately, analysts estimate the video site brings in billions of dollars each year, and say it’s among Google’s fastest-growing businesses. “American advertisers making statements will cause American investors to pay infinitely more attention to an issue that is already gripping much of the industry,” said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group, which downgraded Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s stock on Monday over the issue. Google tried to head off the backlash this week, implementing new tools and policies. But many advertisers were waiting to see further details or results, before placing ads again. Sainsbury’s Plc, the British Broadcasting Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and Havas each said Wednesday that their decision to pull ads from YouTube hasn’t changed following Google’s announcements. Brentford, UK-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc, one of the biggest drug makers, joined the boycott on Wednesday. ”The placement of our brands next to extremist content is completely unacceptable to us and we have raised our concerns directly with Google,” the company said. “We are encouraged by Google’s steps over the past few days.” A representative for Google declined to comment on individual customers. “As announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” the representative said. “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” —  Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Workflow app is free to download after Apple acquisition Uber resumes self-driving programme three days after Arizona crash UK minister says encryption on messaging services is unacceptable Digi spearheads digital learning trend among employees Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT All Advice People Employers Jobs Advice Image: nd3000/Shutterstock What is transformational talent and how can we get it? by Jenny Darmody 1 day ago55 Shares Transformational talent brings maximum impact and top results, but many companies are looking for it in the wrong way. We all know about top talent, and we know about the importance of retaining the very best. But have you heard of transformational talent? If top talent is a cut above the rest, transformational talent is several cuts above the best. They are high-performing, high-impact employees with initiative and a desire to progress. Finding transformational talent But what exactly is the measure of transformational talent? Well, that depends on the company and how high it is measuring the bar. According to Paul D’Arcy, senior vice-president of Indeed, there are various numbers from top companies such as Google and Apple on how a top performer compares to an average one. He said that some companies might consider transformational talent as someone who has four times the impact of an average performer. Others might consider them to have ten times the impact. “Google says that a top performing software engineer is 300 times the impact of an average performing one,” said D’Arcy. While the bar can clearly change depending on your environment, there are some basic markers that make someone transformational, or at least show someone to have the potential to be transformational. “It’s a mix of people that take initiative, people who have a bias towards action and then experience, people who have the knowledge and specialised skills to be successful,” said D’Arcy. While one or the other can be very effective towards making a candidate a good worker and a top performer, D’Arcy said it is the combination of the two that are really powerful. “If you have the contacts and the experience and then this innate bias towards action, that together is a foundation for transformational talent.” The HR hunting myth It’s widely believed within recruitment and HR that the cream of the crop have already been snapped up by companies that make them happy. D’Arcy said there seems to be a myth, particularly in the technology sector, that the vast majority of talent is passive and not looking for opportunities, and would therefore have to be headhunted by companies that want them. This leads many organisations to believe that a lot of outbound effort is needed to find transformational talent. He said: “What we’ve seen is just the opposite.” Looking at transformational talent and analysing how those people actually get jobs, D’Arcy found them to be active in their search for opportunities. “In the same way that they’re high impact in their work environment, they’re high impact in the way they manage their life and they want to be in control of their destiny,” he said. “We looked at people who took a new job in the last year and during the six months prior to taking that job, more than 90pc of them did things that look like they were actively looking for a job.” He said that when companies are attempting to pull transformational talent from elsewhere, they’re usually trying to do it with compensation. This is hard to do because salary is rarely, if ever, the most important thing about a job for employees who are transformational. Quality v quantity So how can companies find transformational talent in their pipeline or encourage them to apply for jobs in the company? D’Arcy said that many recruitment processes for large organisations are flawed and designed in such a way that actually block out the high-impact candidates they seek. Hiring Now Always at the cutting edge of new innovation Excellence in research for innovation and analytics Help develop the future of sales and trading 2016 Graduate Employer of the Year “It’s amazing how many larger companies have recruiting processes that systematically eliminate transformational talent,” he said. “A lot of organisations create these heavily screened pipelines where there are so many steps to go through the process, pretty much only someone who’s desperate will go through the process. Transformational talent won’t, they’ll apply elsewhere.” He said the US were particularly bad for this type of recruitment process, putting the average length of a job application at more than 60 questions. When conducting this research, D’Arcy and the Indeed team applied for every job from the Fortune 500 companies along with the leading companies in various other countries, including France, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and Australia. “We found that it’s not unusual for a job application in the US to take 20 to 30 minutes, whereas in Australia [and the] Netherlands, it’s a minute or two.” Separate the wheat from the chaff Bringing the recruitment process down from a 60-question application to a simple request for a CV and cover letter comes with its own flaws. “It remains a highly flawed process,” said D’Arcy. He said that while there are ways a recruiter can look out for the markers of someone who is transformational, a bad CV could still hide these indicators. How can companies find that transformational needle in the haystack of average or unsuitable candidates? The danger switches from turning the best people off applying, to burying the best people in so many applications that they’re impossible to find. Xero is a New Zealand-based firm that tackles this problem well. For every new position, they create up to three questions that are very specific to each role. It’s still a relatively quick process for the candidate, but gives the recruiters a way of screening correct applicants for the role. What to look for For companies and recruiters, the main marker of a transformational candidate, according to D’Arcy, is a bias towards action. In terms of a CV or letter, this can be found when the applicant took initiative, when they got results or when they took progress into their own hands. “Bias towards action doesn’t have to be a forcefulness,” he said. “It could be just someone willing to ask the next question or do the next thing.” He also suggested that companies look inward and decide what their own ‘bar’ is for what they consider transformational. Identifying what makes someone transformational by your organisation’s standards can go a long way towards identifying new candidates. It is important to know that the motivators for these candidates are different to other talent. “[Transformational people] tend to be more focused on impact, responsibility, the meaningfulness of work – and they’re significantly less focused on salaries.” Look inward While some people might have a natural inclination towards success, and an innate bias towards action, a lot of the fundamentals of transformational talent can be learned. Therefore, it is important for companies and recruiters to look at their current talent and encourage them towards becoming transformational. D’Arcy said that giving employees the tools to become transformational can be just as important as finding them in the first place. He cited three important actions for companies aspiring to have a team of such talent. First, they must identify the markers of transformational talent within the company and encourage those with potential to have that important bias towards action. Secondly, they must ensure that they have the right environment to retain this talent. An employee’s experience, the company leadership and the opportunities to progress are most important. “People who are transformational have options so they’re more likely to need to be inspired to stay,” he said. Finally, when you’re looking to recruit, the application process is crucial. “Look at the complexity of the apply process and the information that is being gathered … simplify it, and align it with the markers of transformational talent.” Tweet Share Email Share More Share Pin This Reddit Related: recruitment, skills, Know-How, Indeed By Jenny Darmody Jenny joined Silicon Republic in 2016 as part of the Careers team.

Millions use it daily, but most don’t know about all of the options and controls available. With that in mind, below we’ll be sharing some helpful Google Maps features you’re probably not using. Over the past few years Google has evolved Maps into an extremely capable app. Full of features like offline navigation, transit times, find nearby restaurants and more. It has a lot to offer. Those are just a few of many awesome tips or features that many don’t know about, but should. Read: 12 Google Maps Tips & Tricks I use Google Maps at least a few times a week, but typically just use my voice to ask for navigation instructions. Then close it when I’m done. Did you know there is actually a slew of awesome features that can make the app even better? Hiding in settings are some of the most useful tools, but most don’t know they exist. In fact, in March of 2017 Google added one of the most requested features to Maps. Which is real-time location sharing. Whether you’re on a road trip or just heading to a meeting, you can share the trip with people. So family won’t have to ask for ETAs or checkin to make sure you arrived to another state safely. Considering that feature is brand new and just added, most don’t know about it. Not to mention there are controls to make the map always face upwards and North, which I didn’t know until just recently. When the map rotates and isn’t facing the right direction it can be frustrating, so we’ll explain that and a few other features below. Without further delay, these are some of the best Google Maps features you’re not using, but should be. Save Maps for Offline Use One of my favorite features for traveling is savings maps for offline use. Essentially users are able to select a large portion of an entire city or highway, and save the map temporarily to their device. This is extremely helpful when traveling out of state, or somewhere you know you won’t have cell service. As you probably know, Google Maps won’t work very well without 4G LTE or a solid internet and data connection on your phone. If that might be an issue, save the map offline. You’ll have the same zoom options as before, making sure you’re never lost. For more details you can checkout this full How-To Guide, or watch the video below. It was made a few years ago, but the same steps apply. Essentially just have the portion you want to save on the screen and hit the voice button. Then say, “Ok Maps” and it will popup with an option to download that entire area. Or type it into the navigation search bar. Easy enough, right. Google has increased this to allow for huge areas of a map, around 250MB worth, and they save temporarily to your device for 30 days. Keep Map Facing North and Up One of the most frustrating things while looking at a map or using navigation is when the map is turned sideways. It throws you off, gets people turned around, and can be very confusing. Did you know hidden deep in settings is an option to force Google Maps to always have North facing upwards, like it should be? Well, now you do. Open Google Maps and swipe from left to right to open the side menu. Next scroll down and select settings. Inside settings scroll down again near the bottom to “Navigation Settings”. Now just turn on the option (flip the switch) labeled “Keep map north up”. Now whenever you’re using Maps it will face upwards and the right way, making navigation or getting directions even easier. This should be enabled by default. Turn Off Navigation Voice During Phone Calls These days most people have their smartphone connected to their car or stereo with Bluetooth. Allowing for hands-free calls, music and navigation. Keeping your eyes and hands where they should be, and not on a phone. Read: How to Send Map Directions to Android from PC or Mac If you’ve ever been using Maps Navigation and had to answer a phone call, or call a friend to get further instructions, you’ve experienced this problem. While on a phone call the voice instructions for Navigation will continue to go off in the background, loudly, through the car speakers. Making it difficult to stay on a phone call. Or even without bluetooth, it still happens. Don’t toggle the mute button every time you need to, let Maps do this automatically instead. Just like our instructions above, head into Google Maps settings, and then the option labeled Navigation Settings. The third option in here is “Play voice during phone calls” which is the audible turn-by-turn navigation instructions. Simply swipe the switch to off, and we’re all done. Now you’ll have voice instructions for navigation as always, but it will turn off automatically during a phone call, and come back on when you hang up. Making navigation easier and keeping users safe. Navigation Instructions While Offline Similar to saving maps for offline usage, there’s another option for full turn-by-turn navigation instructions when we don’t have an internet connection or cell service. This is far more helpful than just saving a map, as the app will continue to give you full instructions even without having service. Perfect for cross-country road trips and such. The full set of instructions on how to use navigation offline can be found here. Simply search for a location, city or destination. Once Maps finds it, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. You can save the destination, share it with friends or start navigation, but there’s also a big “Download” button. Click this, and it will save turn-by-turn navigation instructions from your location to the destination. It’s very similar to saving the map offline, and extremely useful. Share Location and ETA Last but not least, is the newest and one of the most helpful features in Google Maps. The ability to share your location, or even navigation progress, in real-time with friends and family. Think about all those questions you get while traveling. When will you be here? How far are you? What’s your ETA? Or even, did you make it there safe? All of those questions can be answered instantly and automatically be sharing your location with a friend or family member. Instead of replying to texts and taking eyes off the road, use this feature. For your sake, and for the others on the road. This is the newest feature added to Google Maps. Location can be shared by email, text message or other means. And can be shared once, for 15 minutes, or up to three days. Then a family member can see where you are, watch you drive in real-time, and see the same estimated time of arrival as you. Knowing exactly what time you’ll get to town. While using navigation just swipe from left to right, or tap the blue dot (which is you and your location) and hit “Share Location”. Next just choose for how long, and who, and send it using your messaging service of choice. You’re all done. Maps will have a visual reminder on the screen at all times when location is being shared, for privacy reasons of course. Should You Use These? And that’s it. These are five extremely helpful features that many don’t know exist inside of Google Maps. Make the map face north and upwards at all times. Save maps or navigation offline so it works without cell service. Don’t let turn-by-turn voice drowned out your phone calls, and share your location with friends or loved ones. Whether you want to use these features or not is up to you. Some may like the map turning, but I want it facing North. It’s all about personal preference, but all five of these relatively unknown settings or features can really help users get the most from Google Maps. Enjoy.

The new section is called the ‘Free app of the week’ and will now highlight one free app every week. One detail to note is that the new free apps section only appears the US storefront for now. As pointed out by Android Police, accessing the Free Apps section is fairly simple. If you are on your desktop, simply point your browser to the Google Play Store and then click on the Apps section. Once in there scroll down right to the very bottom (Yes, its an odd place to showcase something that’s up for free) to find the ‘free app section”. If you are on your smartphone, simply tap on the Play Store icon and then scroll down to the same section. The section is expected to feature a free app every week. This week’s free app, is Card Wars – Adventure Time by Cartoon Network. The Free App feature has just been introduced and this comes after Google recently started testing new sale features on the developer console. The apps can now be free for a maximum of 8 days and only once in 30 days. While this will bring about a substantial rise in the number of downloads or installs for the said app, Google is playing fair here as free downloads don’t show up in the developer console as buyers and the app won’t be listed on any top paid lists during the sale. In comparison, iOS has been offering one free app per week since 2012. Apple had introduced the section to give more visibility to apps. Apple developers have been allowed to change their pricing from free to paid and back, to paid. From March 2016, Google allowed select publishers to temporarily drop their prices to free, an important tool for promoting downloads.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona.

Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

Especially in the world of mobile apps, free apps, or even freemium ones, have a strong pull. Google’s Play Store has lots of free apps and games but it’s also notorious for having tons of low-quality, even deceptive, entries. That is probably why Google has created its own curated and recommended section for free apps. But there’s one catch: its highlighted app will only be free for a week. Free apps of the week isn’t exactly a novel idea. Apple’s iTunes App Store has long had one. Some game distribution stores even have their own. Google, however, has so far never jumped on board that train, at least until now. And, even then, to a somewhat limited degree. Users have started reporting noticing a new Free App of the Week section in the Android app store. This week’s pioneering entry is Card Wars – Adventure Time. The name says it all, with the game being a tongue-in-cheek version of popular card battling games that have recently also become popular on mobile devices. Card Wars – Adventure time normally costs $2.99, which some except Adventure Time fans might balk at. But for a limited time, you can install it for free. But you probably wouldn’t have known that unless you happen to have stumbled on this still mostly hidden feature. Google Play Store’s Free App of the Week is still visible only for some select markets, which will probably hurt the discovery of whatever app gets the honor of landing there. Curiously, though, the app or game itself is still free, even if you can’t see the new section.

Google Play Store Starts Offering a Free Android App Every Week GO The first free app is Car Wars-Adventure Time Mar 27, 2017 06:28 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google recently updated its Play Store to offer users the possibility to download one free Android app per week. The new section will include one paid app that’s offered for free every week, and the update started rolling out over the weekend. Sadly, it’s only available in the US for now, but we expect Google to offer the new section globally soon enough. The first free app is Card Wars – Adventure Time, a game based on Cartoon Network’s Adventure Time show. The app normally costs $2.99, but Google is offering it for free for a limited time. The game is also available on iOS for the price of $3.99. This isn’t the first time that Google offers such a deal. Back in 2015, the tech giant ran a similar weekly promotion, but later decided against it. Google Play Store runs a similar promotion to App Store Google isn’t the only app store to offer free applications each week. Apple has been running a similar promotion in its App Store, providing iOS users with access to a “Free iOS app of the week” without requiring them to pay. This week’s free iOS app is a video camera and editing app called Musemage, which normally costs $3.99, but users don’t have to pay for it if they download the app this week. Apple offers both productivity and game apps for free each week, and we expect Google to adopt a similar move. Truth be told, the Play Store has lots of free applications and alternatives to paid apps that users can check out, but this is mostly applicable for productivity offerings.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Introduces New Play Store Section Corazon Victorino International Business TimesMarch 27, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Google is updating its Play Store to include a new section that would present users with a free app for the week. The apps that will be featured in here are premium apps on regular days that will be free for the period that they appear in this section.  According to Venture Beat, Google wants to promote more Android apps to users, so it is expanding its Play Store to include a section for a weekly free app. The new feature will not be limited to the smartphone version of the Play Store since it can also be directly accessed via desktop and other mobile devices.  Android Police believes that Google launched this Free App of the Week section because it wants to better highlight the sales of paid apps. The move is also seen as an extension of what Google has implemented late last month that now allows paid apps and games to go on sale for a short period. Google is, after all, testing new sale features for the Play Store. Once a paid app or game is picked up to be the Free App of the Week, it will appear in this section presumably for seven days. The icon will be displayed alongside the name and the star ratings of the application. The price of the app will also be shown, but for the period that it is featured in the section it will have a strikethrough. The word “FREE” is then placed beside it to clearly show users how much they are saving if they are downloading the app within the period that it is there for free.  The Free App of the Week section is already up, and the first free app Android users can take advantage of is Card Wars — Adventure Time from Cartoon Network. The game is up for grabs for $3.99 on regular days, but users can have it for free this week. Should this continue long-term, users will be getting 52 premium apps for free in a year.  Phandroid says that while this feature is not new to Apple given that the Cupertino giant likes to highlight various apps that have just been added to its App Store, this is something new to Google and it’s good news that it is making this kind of approach in promoting premium apps to users.  Android appsMore Google has added a new section to the Play Store that would present users with a free app for the week.

TARGETING IS KING Ensure you have the right keywords panned out before you even open Power Editor or Facebook Ads Manager to start creating an ad. No matter how much you spend, if you target the wrong audience, you will not get the results you seek. You can get highly targeted Keywords from Google Adwords. Facebook Insights also helps. 2. MORE IS BETTER If you ever plan to place Ads on Facebook and you desire to see great Conversion rates, budget at least $50. I have a rule of thumb that guides me when placing Ads on Facebook - Less than $50 – Like Campaigns, Blog Traffic Above $50 – Product Page, Salesletter, Join Group 3. CREATE YOUR AUDIENCE FIRST You get to know your Audience better when you create them from Facebook’s Super Software – AUDIENCE INSIGHTS. You need Google Chrome to access this feature which will give you greater insights on your target Audience than Ads Manager ever will. 4. NO TESTING, NO SCALING Never ever scale your Ad until you have tested it and it has proven itself as a honeypot for your audience. I have seen people start untested Ads with $20! It sends shivers down my spine. Endeavour to test your Ad-set to ensure it ‘fires’ right, displays right and converts right before scaling it up. For example, if you’re going to run a Page Like Campaign, run a $2 for 24 hours first. If done right, your Ad should record at least 30-40 Likes. Anything short of this is Failure. Redesign your Ad and Test again or else you’ll be flushing hard earned currency down Zuckerberg’s pocket when you scale that Ad to $20 and above. There are 3 Parameters/Metrics used in measuring the Success or Failure of any Facebook Ad - i. CPR (Cost per Result) –The average cost per result from your ads. A CPR of $0.01 per Page like is Optimum. CPR of $0.30 upwards is Failure! ii. Reach – The number of people who saw your ads at least once. Reach is different from impressions, which may include multiple views of your ads by the same people. iii. Results – The number of times your ad achieved an outcome, based on the objective you selected. 5. INSTAGRAM? NEVER! I once ran a $20 Ad on Facebook for 2 Days. Facebook diverted 90% of the Ad to Instagram and the post generated 2,000 likes on the first day and by the second, it was upwards of 5,000 Likes. Guess how many people bought the Product? ZERO! Guess how many Instagram followers I got? 60! Did I ask Facebook to send my Ad to Instagram? NO & YES! If you don’t learn anything from me today, learn this – NEVER EVER allow Facebook divert your Ad to Instagram or their ‘Audience Network’ except you have genuine reasons. If you create an Ad for Facebook and it gets to Instagram, many users will see it and many will like the image but they will not get to your Product Page because Instagram will never re-direct them there. Except there have been very recent changes in the Facebook-Instagram apposition, you will need special software to get Instagram Pictures to redirect clicks to your product page. (Instagram Advertising is topic for another day). This mistake is one made by some of the biggest Marketing companies and gurus and unknown to them, it is a ‘minor but costly’ mistake! I once saw a sponsored post on Instagram requesting me to go like a Facebook Page. I shook my head in pity, thinking “Men, I’m never going to leave Instagram to go like your Page on Facebook bro." "Well done Mr. Zuckerberg!” How do you avoid this dreadful mistake Facebook wants you to keep making? - Create your Ads using Ads Manager/Audience Insights - When you get to the Placements Column, select ‘Edit Placement’. This is very important. Unselect the Instagram and Audience Network options and leave only the Facebook Options. By now they will become default. Save this setting and continue creating your Ad. You are good to go. (Y) 6. IMAGE I learnt this very important skill from Nigeria's Best Copywriter - Ronald Nzimora (Sir Ronald) you need to pay attention here. If you are going to create an Ad-set targeting Single Ladies in Nigeria, you can’t go around using the face of an obese white woman smiling sheepishly at the camera. WTH are you thinking?! Sir Ronald taught me this – if you’re going to advertise to a target audience, ensure your image reflects the Position, Feeling, Mood and Demographic of that audience. If you’re creating an as for unemployed youths in Nigeria, Google ‘Frustrated Black Man’. Select Images. Search for the most frustrated black man in the grid. Save his pic to your computer. Appropriate for your Ad. AGAIN, your Ad Image must either showcase your Product or connect with the Position, Feeling, Mood and Demographic of your Audience. This inherently leads to the next Top Tip – 7. AD-SET STRUCTURE For optimum performance, your Facebook Ad must contain the following – - An Attractive Image/Video - A Compelling Story or Question - A Clear Call to Action The latter 2 can come in any order - * ‘LIKE our Page to get the Latest Tips on Poultry and Fish Farming’ * ‘Want to get the Latest Job and Vacancy News? LIKE our Page now The Shorter the Better. If people have to click ‘See More’ to view your complete Ad, you have lost 10-20% of your Audience. 8. PURCHASING POWER Once you hit ‘Publish’ on that Ad you just spent the last 30 minutes crafting, it is your heart’s deepest desire to see your Page Likes, Traffic and Bank alerts roll in. However, this is not often the case and 90% of the time, it is because your Adverts have fallen into the wrong hands. Sometimes, you have used the best Keywords to target your Audience and you are getting great Impressions and Engagements but the Ad is just not converting. Facebook Pixel informs you that they are landing on your Product Page and some are even clicking the Add to Cart button, but none is checking out. Sir, this is the problem – You are targeting the right audience, but most of them cannot pay. How can you ensure the PAYABILITY of your target audience? i. Age Targeting – In placing ads on Facebook, use 25 – 65+ in the age column to ensure your audience have purchasing power and also to include those with inflated ages. ii. Device Targeting – Laptop users are more relaxed or more likely to be situated in a more relaxed environment than mobile users. They are therefore more likely to relax and read your Ad. DISCLAIMER: This is not to say you should not target mobile users, but again, TEST. Also, proper Device Targeting will ensure the Ad for your N30,000 Premium Product does not land in the hands of Mallam Abubakar in a danfo with his Tecno T1 on the way to his house in Oworonsoki. iPhone users are more likely to be richer than Android users. An additional Ad-set for strictly iPhone users will not be out of place. DISCLAIMER: I mean no disrespect to Android users as I am an Android user myself but this is Business – No sentiments. iii. Timing – ‘Salary don enter’. The first week of the month is usually the best week of the month to tantalize your Audience with your Products and Services. 9. No one ever gets Facebook Ads right, the first time except by exceptional skills in targeting, continuous testing and mentoring. PS: I am putting together a Manual that would CRUSH all your Facebook Ads frustration and literally turn your life around! It explains with Pictures, how you can use the 'LJS FORMULA' to make N1,000,000 in sales within 30 Days with just 1 Facebook Page, 1 Group and $100.
